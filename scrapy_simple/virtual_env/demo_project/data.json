        "title": "Will Exxon's Next Mega Project Get The Go Ahead?",
        "content": "Exxon will likely make the final investment decision for its Mozambique LNG project next year, Reuters reports, citing the country's National Petroleum Institute.The supermajor postponed the FID on the Rovuma project in March as part of wider measures to combat the effects of the oil price crash. Now, oil prices are on the road to recovery, but there is more pain ahead for LNG, with spot prices down to an all-time low of $1.85 per mmBtu. This, according to Reuters' Clyde Russell, has turned LNG into the worst-performing commodity this year.Rovuma LNG is a deepwater project that will tap reserves amounting to more than 85 trillion cu ft of natural gas, according to Exxon. The company was originally planning to greenlight it in the first half of this year but the oil price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia combined with the coronavirus pandemic threw a wrench in Exxon's works. The oil crisis was accompanied by a similar development in LNG as well, with oversupply pushing prices to historic lows and demand slackening off.In early 2019, Exxon said it had secured long-term purchasing commitments from Rovuma, which will have a planned capacity of 15.2 million tons of liquefied natural gas annually. Production was scheduled to begin in 2024. But with the oil crisis and the pandemic come problems that proved overwhelming. The delay will cost Exxon lagging behind the other energy company eager to develop Mozambique's natural gas wealth, French Total. Total made the FID on its project in 2019.Exxon has extensive participation in LNG projects around the world, including in Qatar, the world's biggest producer and exporter of the commodity that is seen as the bridge fuel between the fossil fuel and the renewable energy eras. Exxon also has a stake in Chevron's Gorgon project in Australia, one of the largest globally, and is the operator of the PNG LNG facility in Papua New Guinea.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Russia's Rosneft has set up a new trading arm to replace the one that Washington sanctioned earlier this year for the company's work with the Venezuelan government, unnamed sources in the know have told Reuters.The U.S. administration slapped sanctions on the Russian state oil giant in February as part of its maximum pressure campaign against the Maduro government.\"Today we sanctioned Russian-owned oil firm Rosneft Trading S.A., cutting off Maduro's main lifeline to evade our sanctions on the Venezuelan oil sector. Those who prop up the corrupt regime and enable its repression of the Venezuelan people will be held accountable,\" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a February tweet.Following the announcement, Rosneft cancelled several VLCC cargoes carrying a total 5.7 million barrels of Venezuelan crude to be delivered to Asian buyers. The company also transferred its Venezuelan assets to a newly set-up Russian state-owned company dubbed Roszarubezhneft. Moscow paid for the Venezuelan assets in Rosneft stock.Rosneft had five oil production joint ventures in Venezuela as well as interests in oilfield services businesses, and commercial and trading ventures, the company said at the time.Now, Rosneft confirmed the establishment of the new Swiss-based trading entity.\"Energopole SA is a 100% subsidiary of Rosneft. The company is involved in commercial dealings in the interest of Rosneft and has no connection to Rosneft Trading SA. It is registered in Switzerland and operates in accordance with applicable law,\" the company told Reuters.Meanwhile, Washington tightened the noose further: this week the Department of Treasury said it would sanction maritime companies doing business with the Maduro government.\"The illegitimate Maduro regime has enlisted the help of maritime companies and their vessels to continue the exploitation of Venezuela's natural resources for the regime's profit,\" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said, adding that the US will continue to target anyone to supports Maduro's regime and contributes \"to the suffering of the Venezuelan people.\"By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "title": "Angola Cuts Oil-For-Debt Exports To China",
        "content": "Angola is reducing oil shipments to China with which it pays part of its debt to its biggest creditor as the African OPEC member looks for debt relief from its international partners, Reuters reported on Friday, quoting sources with knowledge of the plans.The world's top oil importer, China, is Angola's primary creditor and the African country is repaying part of its debt to China with oil cargoes to its major state-owned oil firms.   However, the oil price crash and the COVID-19 pandemic has severely constrained Angola's income, and the country now seeks to cut cargoes to China for which it doesn't receive hard currency.Angola is one of the worst hit oil producers in the oil price crash, because it lacks large sovereign wealth buffers as some Middle Eastern oil exporters do. In addition, the oil sector is crucial to Angola's economy. Oil production and supporting activities account for half of the nation's gross domestic product (GDP) and around 89 percent of its exports, OPEC data shows.According to Reuters' sources, China's Sinochem will get five oil cargoes from Angola next month, compared to the usual seven or eight cargoes, while Unipec, the trading arm of Sinopec, will not get any Angolan oil in July, compared to the typical two-three cargoes a month for repaying Angola's debt.Earlier this week, Angola's finance ministry said that it was in an advanced stage of talks with some of the importers of its oil to reschedule financing facilities and better reflect the current market environment and OPEC's production quotas. Angola said it hoped to finalize the talks \"in the very near future\" and guarantee mutually favorable conditions for all parties involved.Separately, Angola has asked the G20 group for negotiations for suspension of servicing its bilateral debt under the G20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI), which could ease the pressure on Angola's finances.

        "title": "China Begins Consolidation Of $100+ Billion Oil & Gas Pipeline Industry",
        "content": "China has required the three biggest state-held oil corporations to transfer the management of half of their liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals to the newly created state-controlled midstream firm, Caixin Global reported, citing industry insiders.  The transfer of 10 LNG terminals owned by China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), Sinopec, and China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) is the first step in China's plan to consolidate the oil and gas pipeline infrastructure into a new giant state-held midstream company.At the end of last year, China launched the long-mooted state oil and gas pipeline group combining the infrastructure assets of the state-owned energy majors into one huge midstream group, which analysts say could be worth between US$80 billion and US$105 billion.The new company is part of China's efforts to allow its energy companies to focus on boosting exploration and production. Combining China's pipeline infrastructure into one firm and opening access to this infrastructure to foreign and private producers would help the state oil and gas firms to focus on exploration at a time when China aims to increase its domestic production.Earlier this year, CNOOC said it had signed with the new state pipeline giant to transfer to it the management of oil and gas infrastructure projects. The ten LNG terminals that are set to be transferred to the new company include seven terminals currently managed by CNOOC, two terminals managed by CNPC, and one by Sinopec, according to Caixin.The new state pipeline giant, China Oil & Gas Piping, will initially only have the right to manage the assets, while the oil and gas majors will still own the assets until audits are finalized. After the transfer of the LNG terminals to the new company, there still will be 11 other LNG facilities that will continue to be managed by the three oil and gas majors, Caixin's sources said.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Carbon dioxide emissions resulting from gas flaring in the Permian are set to fall by one-half during the second half of this year, Rystad Energy said, citing the forced production cuts that most, if not all, producers in the shale play had to implement during the current quarter.\"In 2Q20 a material part of Permian oil production is being curtailed, resulting in an abnormal oil production decline that is supporting emission intensity at a level of 7-8 kg CO2 per barrel, despite continuous deceleration in flaring,\" said Rystad's  head of shale research Artem Abramov.But it will not be just the production cuts that will drive emissions down: \"However, assuming that most volumes are brought back in 2H20, we anticipate a significant downward shift in flaring-driven emission intensity,\" Abramov also said.This will be a result of few new well additions during the second half of the year as the price situation will likely remain too weak to motivate investment in new well drilling.Yet in all fairness, gas flaring had been on a plateau even before the Covid-19 pandemic and the Saudi-Russian price war pushed prices down. According to Rystad data, between November last year and January this year the amount of emissions was flat, at some 500 million cu ft daily before rising to 600 million cu ft daily in February as a number of wells were completed.Last year, gas flaring in the Permian hit an all-time high of 661 million cu ft daily, driven by insufficient pipeline takeaway capacity that forced producers to flare the associated gas from their oil wells.Gas flaring is the practice of burning associated gas that comes out of an oil well with the oil. In 2018, the shale boom drove the amount of gas flared in the United States up 48 percent, and the global total up 3 percent to 145 billion cubic meters, according to data from the World Bank.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "OPEC+ is reportedly close to agreeing on an extension of the deep production cuts it signed up for in April, after the cartel's leaders managed to convince Iraq of the continued need for oil production control, Bloomberg's Javier Blas and Grant Smith write.There have been doubts about the future of the cuts because earlier reports said that Russia may not be on board with them. Then Iraq came to the fore as a stumbling block.Bloomberg reported yesterday that Saudi Arabia and Russia were getting increasingly fed up with OPEC's number-two's consistent failure to comply with its production quotas.\"Riyadh and Moscow are not kidding about implementing some form of compliance-improvement mechanism,\" Rapidan Energy Group founder Bob McNally told Bloomberg. \"Without it, they walk.\"According to the Bloomberg report, Saudi Arabia and Russia are running out of patience with Iraq and anyone else falling short of their targets. They are insisting that the laggards not only keep to their quotas but that they cut deeper in the coming months to make up for their earlier shortfalls.This internal discord in the cartel sparked worry about the future of the deal. If one member of OPEC believes it can pump more than its quota, then what is to stop others from doing the same, the argument runs. And we have seen it before, when it was again Iraq falling short of its production targets prompting other OPEC members to voice their disgruntlement with the fact.But now, according to one delegate who spoke to Bloomberg, this has been settled now and the OPEC+ club will meet on Saturday to make it official that the 9.7-million-bpd in production cuts will be extended to the end of July, when, according to Russia's Energy Minister, the oil market could swing into a shortage of 3 to 5 million bpd.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Russia's Energy Minister Alexander Novak is predicting a shortage in the oil market next month, Ifax reported on Thursday.Novak said that the global oil markets could see a shortfall between three and five million barrels per day in July, depending on the outcome of the OPEC meeting that could be held yet this week.The meeting that will help shape the future of the oil market over the next few months is proving difficult, however, even though it would appear that Saudi Arabia and Russia have reached an agreement in principle to extend the current level of cuts through the end of July.The cuts are currently set to ease starting in July.But negotiations among the cartel members are complex, with Iraq, Angola, Nigeria, and Kazakhstan overproducing--a bone of contention with more fastidious members such as Saudi Arabia.OPEC+'s compliance reached 89% in May. OPEC's second largest producer, Iraq, reached only 42% compliance, based off of preliminary data. While Saudi Arabia and Russia agreed to extend the cuts at least for another month, they are not interested in doing so unless Iraq and the other overproducers bring their production in line with the given quotas.OPEC+ quotas call for total cuts of 9.7 million bpd. Oil demand, however, is still off by 21 million bpd as of May, according to Novak. But that's up from 25-28 million bpd off in April.Novak added that the filling up of oil storage has slowed, and that thanks to the current production cuts and the improving demand figures so far, the market should achieve balance in June, before slipping into a deficit in July.Based on May's production, OPEC has another 1 million barrels to cut to get into full compliance with the current deal.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "title": "US Gulf Of Mexico More Resilient To Oil Price Crash This Time",
        "content": "The U.S. Gulf of Mexico is better prepared now to ride out the oil crisis than it was in the 2015-2016 downturn, as 82 percent of oil production has a short-run marginal cost - operating costs, taxes, and royalties - of US$10 a barrel Brent, Wood Mackenzie said on Thursday.  The Gulf of Mexico is now nimbler and leaner and more resilient to the recent oil price crash and current downturn, the consultancy said in new research.Despite the lower costs and leaner operations compared to the previous crisis, the Gulf of Mexico will not remain unscathed by this year's price collapse as companies have cut budgets and recalibrated exploration and sanctioning plans, WoodMac said.Offshore oil has also felt the severity of the oil price collapse, and it could take years for some offshore regions around the world to recover.According to WoodMac, capital expenditure (capex) by Gulf of Mexico operators is expected to drop to US$7.4 billion this year, down by 22 percent or US$4 billion from 2019.Related: What's Holding Natural Gas Prices Back?In addition, production from the region could see its first decline since 2013, due to reduced budgets that could change the scope and timeline for drilling campaigns and new projects, Wood Mackenzie said. Before the coronavirus and the oil price crash, the consultancy had expected the Gulf of Mexico to break yet another production record this year and pump 2.2 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed). The forecast is now revised down by 200,000 boed. Yet, recovery in production is set to come as early as next year because start-up dates for major projects in the near term haven't been delayed, WoodMac said.  Exploration is set to suffer more, with just 15 wells expected this year--a historic low for the Gulf of Mexico and recovery will take time.In project approvals, WoodMac sees no US GoM project sanctioned this year.\"But, unlike the last downturn, where some projects were cancelled, this time project FIDs have simply been deferred. This is attributed to the relatively competitive economics of the pre-FID projects in the region, which could come down even further with cost deflation,\" the consultancy said.

        "content": "Saudi Arabia is looking to boost its non-oil revenues while its oil revenue is taking a hit in the low oil prices and is raising customs duties on hundreds of imported products as of June 10.The Saudis will be lifting import duties on products ranging from meat, dairy, and vegetables to chemicals, vehicles, and building materials. The import fees on those products will be raised by between 0.5 percentage point and 15 percentage points, starting next week.   The increased import duties are yet another move from the world's top oil exporter to try to collect more money for its budget at a time when low oil prices are crushing Saudi oil revenues.However, analysts say that higher import duties will hit consumers at a time when consumer spending and confidence is at a low point due to the economic crisis triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic and the oil price crash, to which the Kingdom itself contributed by waging a price war for market share in March.  \"Any customs rate increase will present an unexpected increase in costs for importers, manufacturers, and those involved in the supply chain, including the final consumers,\" KPMG said, commenting on the increased import duties.Last month, Saudi Arabia said it was tripling its value-added tax (VAT) and suspending cost-of-living allowances as part of a new round of painful austerity measures to save the Kingdom's finances after oil prices collapsed in the pandemic.Three weeks after the announcement of these measures, Moody's changed the outlook on Saudi Arabia to 'negative' from 'stable', to reflect \"increased downside risks to Saudi Arabia's fiscal strength stemming from the severe shock to global oil demand and prices triggered by the coronavirus pandemic, and from the uncertainty regarding the degree to which the government will be able to offset its oil revenue losses and stabilize its debt burden and assets in the medium term.\"By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

The bill also targets companies providing insurance or reinsurance for the vessels and firms helping the vessels operate including those providing welding equipment, retrofitting, or tethering, according to the bill seen by Reuters.Republican Senator Ted Cruz, one of the sponsors of the new bill, has said that it \"makes clear those involved with vessels installing the pipeline will face crippling and immediate sanctions,\" as carried by Reuters.Last week, outgoing U.S. Ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, said that the United States was considering additional sanctions on Nord Stream 2 which is planned to bring Russian gas to Germany via the Baltic Sea.

The bid round is the first of this type since 2002, with which the government hopes to raise money amid the oil crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, which is battering Nigeria's economy and oil industry.The bid round includes 57 oil blocks, including 11 blocks which the Nigerian government had revoked from companies in April on the grounds that they had failed to develop them and bring them to production.The companies whose licenses were revoked appealed the decision of the Nigerian Department of Petroleum Resources and the federal high court granted this week an injunction, preventing the government from auctioning off the 11 oilfields \"pending the determination of the substantive suit,\" Bloomberg reported.The so-called marginal fields are a small portion of Nigeria's oil production. In 2018, such oilfields allocated in the 2002 bid round pumped 65,000 barrels per day (bpd), or just 3 percent of the production in Africa's top oil producer, according to data from the Department of Petroleum Resources cited by Bloomberg.Meanwhile, Nigeria, one of the laggards in compliance in the OPEC+ deal, said that it is committed to achieving full compliance.\"Nigeria has made concerted efforts to adhere to this commitment and will continue to do so unequivocally,\" Timipre Sylva, Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, said on Instagram this week. Nigeria cut its production in May to 1.613 million bpd, for a compliance rate of about 52 percent, Sylva said.\"It is worthy to note that current daily crude oil production is well below the period commitment level of 1.412 million barrels per day and will translate to full compliance by end of June 2020,\" the minister added, noting that \"Nigeria will continue to fully comply with the agreement and look forward to improving on its compliance levels for the lifespan of this historic intervention by OPEC+.\"  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

Energy imports accounted for more than a quarter of all U.S. imports from Canada, at 27 percent, according to Census Bureau data.While Canada is the biggest energy supplier to the United States, it is also the second-biggest destination for U.S. energy exports, behind Mexico.In the U.S.-Canada energy trade, crude oil and petroleum products accounted for 91 percent of the value of U.S. energy imports from Canada and 89 percent of the value of U.S. energy exports to Canada.American crude oil imports from Canada accounted for 56 percent of all U.S. crude oil imports last year. Crude imports from Canada averaged 3.8 million barrels per day (bpd), up from 3.7 million bpd average imports in 2018. Canada mostly exports heavy crude oil from Alberta to America's refineries, mostly in the Midwest.On the other hand, Canada was the top destination for U.S. crude oil exports, which tend to be sweet light grades exported to eastern Canada. Last year, the U.S. exported on average 459,000 bpd of crude oil to Canada, according to Census Bureau data.Due to the chronic shortage of pipeline takeaway capacity out of Canada in recent years, U.S. imports of crude by rail from Canada tripled between 2016 and 2019--from an average of 91,000 bpd to an average of 300,000 bpd last year, the EIA said.

        "content": "The construction of a stretch of the expanded Trans Mountain oil pipeline has started in British Columbia, the province whose government has been vocally opposed to the project.The Trans Mountain company said in a statement that work had begun on a seven-kilometer section in the City of Kamloops, to continue about seven months. The company also said investment in that stretch alone will be over $450 million over the next two years.The construction of the British Columbia stretch became possible earlier this year, when the Supreme Court dismissed an appeal by British Columbia to stop work on the expansion project. The provincial government argued the expansion will increase the risk of spills and leaks both along its route and in the waters around the port of Burnaby where the pipeline is supposed to load oil onto tankers bound for export markets. To prevent the expansion from taking place, the government decided to claim a right to dictate how much oil and gas pass through the territory of the province.It first took its case to the British Columbia Court of Appeals, but the court rejected the case saying that the province did not have jurisdiction over the amount of oil that can pass through its territory.The Trans Mountain pipeline currently has a capacity of 300,000 bpd of crude. After the expansion is completed, it would be able to ship 890,000 bpd of crude to the British Columbian coast.According to the Trans Mountain company, the demand for the oil is there: it said it expected the average daily demand this year to be 316,000 bpd, up from 313,900 bpd last year. In the first quarter, however, Trans Mountain transported less than that, at 297,000 bpd, which was probably to be expected amid the oil price war that led to a slump in oil prices and the pandemic, which deepened the slump.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "China will begin monitoring how closely provinces stick to clean energy targets set by the central government, Bloomberg reports, citing a statement by the National Development and Reform Commission.The country has increased its renewable energy generation target for this year to 28.2 percent of the total, with 10.8 percent to come from non-hydropower sources. This would be up by a modest 0.7 percentage points from 2019.Last month, China's Xinhua reported that renewable energy generation had risen steadily during the first quarter of the year, with capacity up by 8.4 percent from the first quarter of 2019 to 802 million kW. Electricity output from renewable sources, the national Energy Administration said, reached 392.34 billion kWh, up by 3.84 million kWh from a year earlier.Now, the National Development and Reform Commission has set individual targets for each Chinese province except Tibet, which already generates most of the electricity it needs from renewable sources.Interestingly, Beijing plans to boost solar and wind capacity this year, after last year it slashed subsidies for these two renewable energy streams. Beijing had said earlier this year it will only approve new solar and wind power installations if their developers can prove the energy they generate is as cheap as that generated in coal-fired power plants.Plans to add some 85.1 GW of solar and wind capacity this year suggests costs of solar and wind projects have fallen sufficiently to compete with coal-fired power plants. Of this total, solar will account for 48.45 GW and wind will account for 35.1 GW.Meanwhile, Chinese solar businesses are struggling with falling prices for their products and services as the pandemic delays and cancels projects around the world. This, according to Bloomberg could result in sector consolidation and a new solar boom once the crisis is over, spurred by the low prices.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "After abruptly postponing a lease sale in New Mexico last month, the Trump Administration has postponed additional oil and gas lease sales in Nevada and Mississippi, the Bureau of Land Management's online auction website showed.The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) of the Department of the Interior is postponing a lease sale of seven parcels covering 10,459 acres in Nevada, which was originally slated to take place on June 9. The BLM has also postponed the lease sale of two parcels covering 88 acres in Mississippi which had to be auctioned on June 18. The latest postponements in federal oil and gas lease sales come after BLM postponed in May a lease sale in New Mexico of 95 parcels totaling 45,446 acres in Chaves, Eddy, and Lea counties in New Mexico; and Wise County in Texas.The oil and gas lease sale in the state home to the westernmost part of the Permian basin would have been the first auction for drilling on federal land since U.S. benchmark prices flipped negative in April a day before the expiry of the May futures contract of WTI Crude.In March, after oil prices crashed, the Administration proceeded with lease sales in four Western states: Montana, Nevada, Wyoming, and Colorado, despite calls for immediate suspension of oil and gas drilling lease sales on federal land amid slumping prices. The lease sales have also drawn criticism from environmental groups who have alleged, among other things, that the BLM denied a request to suspend the comment period during the coronavirus pandemic.But since the end of March, the Administration has postponed lease sales in New Mexico, Nevada, and Mississippi.According to the EnergyNet website, there are still two lease sales planned for June that have not yet been postponed. One is a federal lease sale of 135 parcels covering 169,750 acres in Wyoming on June 23-24, and a lease sale of 15 parcels covering 4,851 acres in Colorado on June 25.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "title": "COVID-19 Fuels Fire Sale Of Oil & Gas Assets",
        "content": "Oil and gas companies currently have assets for sale with recoverable reserves of more than 5 billion barrels of liquids and 7.5 billion barrels of oil equivalent (boe) of natural gas, Rystad Energy estimates.  While some of these planned divestments were announced before the Covid-19-related oil price crash, more were added in reaction to the pandemic and its aftermath.Our estimates look at divestment opportunities that exclude unconventional and US onshore assets, announced since the fourth quarter of 2019.The majority of resources on offer are in the producing phase, followed by volumes of undeveloped resources in the pre-front-end engineering and design (pre-FEED) stage. In other words, companies are either getting rid of their mature portfolio to focus on key projects, or want to avoid additional greenfield costs in light of the current low crude price.\"Many players are trying to divest their low-priority assets, while others are considering this the right time to break into the industry or expand their portfolios by acquiring these assets at a lower price,\" says Rystad Energy's senior upstream analyst Siva Prasad.The majors contribute nearly 70% of the liquid volumes and 50% of the gas reserves lined up for divestment globally. ExxonMobil and Chevron are the most active when it comes to divestments among the majors, as both companies seek to meet their respective divestment targets.Related: Saudi Arabia Could Set Trend For Higher Oil Prices In JuneExxonMobil is looking for interested buyers for upstream assets in the US Gulf of Mexico, the UK North Sea, Germany, Nigeria, Malaysia, Indonesia, Romania, Azerbaijan, Vietnam, Chad and Equatorial Guinea as part of its wider plan to generate $15 billion by 2021 and $25 billion by 2025 from divestments.Meanwhile, Chevron is seeking to divest its equity in eight Nigerian blocks, both onshore and in shallow waters, as part of a global drive to reshape its portfolio. The American major is also considering selling its stake in the Indonesian Deepwater Development gas project as part of its strategy to sell its low-priority natural gas projects to control costs in the long term.Total's 12.5% stake in the Nigerian offshore block OML 118, which includes the Bonga, Bonga Southwest and Aparo fields, is also up for sale as part of the French major's bid to raise $5 billion from asset sales around the world by 2020.Related: Russia Is Quickly Becoming The Most Dominant Force In EnergyThe most prominent onshore package in our list of farm-in opportunities is the Kenyan portfolio being offered by Total and Tullow Oil. The two oil and gas producers aim to reduce their stakes in a joint sale of the blocks 10 BA, 10 BB and 13T in the South Lokichar Basin in Kenya. The sale could see Tullow exit the blocks completely amid uncertainty over the project's launch. Total, meanwhile, aims to sell up to half of its 25% stake in the Kenyan project. The entire project is valued at between $1.25 billion and $2 billion, but a precise valuation is not available since the development is yet to receive a final investment decision.When it comes to the reserve volumes put up for sale, the majors are followed by industrial companies led by Japan's Inpex, which is considering farming out of its Australian operations, centered around the $45 billion Ichthys LNG project, among others. Although Inpex is floating all of its Australian operations for sale, a potential divestment deal is unlikely to include the entire portfolio.Along with Inpex, mining conglomerate BHP is considering a potential sale of its assets in Victoria's Bass Strait fields as its Australian oil and gas production continues to decline and the global shift towards electric vehicles paints a grim outlook for long-term demand for hydrocarbons. ExxonMobil, which owns the remaining stakes in the Bass Strait oil and gas fields, already announced in September last year that it would put its 50% stake in the project up for sale.An estimated 104,000 square kilometers of exploration acreage is also up for grabs with potential exploration license sales being part of the asset packages marketed by majors, E&Ps, industrial companies and integrated companies alike. About 83% of the exploration acreage available for farm-in is offshore.By Rystad EnergyMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Occidental Petroleum is evacuating some of its Gulf of Mexico oil facilities ahead of the anticipated storm Cristobal, Occidental said on Wednesday. The evacuated workers so far will be limited to non-essential workers, and interruptions are not expected, Reuters said, according to Oxy.Occidental is the fourth largest producer in the deep waters of Gulf of Mexico with 10 facilities there, according to the company's website.Other oil companies operating in the Gulf of Mexico, including BP, Chevron, Exxon, Hess, Murphy, and Shell, are monitoring the situation but have not decided to remove staff from deepwater platforms.Cristobal will likely reach landfall around the Gulf of Mexico coast, probably around Louisiana, but not before picking up steam in the waters of the Gulf. Gusts of 65 mph are expected.The Gulf of Mexico accounts for some 17 percent of U.S. oil production. In 2018, hurricane Michael shut in production of more than 700,000 bpd for a few days. In 2017, total oil industry--production and refining--hit US$200 billion, the highest storm bill in history.This year there will be fewer evacuations than in years past, even if most operators evacuate staff. The rig count in the Gulf has fallen from over 22 in March, to 20 in April, and then to just 12 in the last week of May. It is the lowest rig count there in a decade.Some analysts are predicting that after shutting in oil production in the Gulf--whether due to coronavirus outbreaks on platforms or due to slack demand and low prices, it may take years for it all to come back online. Any additional shutdowns caused by the tropical storm will likely exacerbate the issue.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Italy's Eni is considering creating a separate division to focus on renewable energy as the oil and gas major--like other European oil firms--is looking to drastically cut emissions and accelerate investments and development in clean energy and technologies.  Eni is set to overhaul its corporate structure, creating a division focused on green energy, Italian business daily Il Sole 24 Ore reported on Tuesday. Eni is weighing the setting up of two divisions whose bosses will report to chief executive Claudio Descalzi. One division will include upstream and midstream activities and will be headed by the current Chief Upstream Officer, Alessandro Puliti, while the other division will include downstream and renewables and will be headed by current chief financial officer Massimo Mondazzi, Il Sole 24 Ore reported.According to analysts at Equita, quoted by the Italian newspaper, Eni's new organization will allow it to accelerate its green energy activities that aim to expand its renewables, bio-refinery, and circular economy businesses. If Eni does separate its oil and gas business from renewables, the market would have a better understanding of the returns from green energy initiatives, the analysts said.  Eni hasn't taken yet a final decision on a possible group overhaul, sources familiar with the plans told Reuters on Wednesday.Just before the coronavirus hit the global economy and the oil industry, Eni unveiled a new long-term strategic plan, under which it expects its oil production to start declining after 2025, while it bets big on renewables. The company expects to have installed renewables capacity of 3 GW by 2023 and 5 GW by 2025, while installed renewables capacity is set to jump to 55 GW by 2050. In addition, Eni plans to obtain by 2050 an 80-percent reduction in net scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, referring to the entire life cycle of the energy products it sells.According to a recent analysis from Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI) - an investor initiative backed by over $19 trillion of global capital - Eni has the most comprehensive strategic response to the energy transition with setting an absolute target to reduce all emissions, including Scope 3, by 80 percent by 2050, and disclosing the expected contribution of carbon capture and storage (CCS).

Shell is the operator and majority interest holder in the QGC venture, while China's CNOOC is a partner in the LNG plant on Curtis Island with a 50-percent equity in Train 1, while Tokyo Gas has a 2.5-perent equity in Train 2.Shell is now looking to sell a minority stake in some of the common facilities of the project, including two LNG storage tanks, terminals, water, fuel, and power generation systems, and a tanker-loading jetty, according to Reuters.Shell is reportedly pitching the facilities to institutional investors and the sale flyer seen by Reuters says that \"Royal Dutch Shell plc is considering a sale of a 26.25% interest in the Queensland Curtis LNG (QCLNG) Common Facilities - a multibillion dollar investment opportunity.\"Sources with knowledge of the sale process told Reuters that such a sale could fetch between US$2 billion and US$3 billion, while Shell declined to comment to Reuters on what it described as 'market speculation.'The QGC venture became majority owned by Shell after the supermajor bought BG Group in 2016.Shell targets to continue divestments of non-core assets after the oil price crash and the uncertainty over near-term recovery forced it to cut its dividend for the first time since World War II.In the natural gas business, Shell exited the proposed Lake Charles LNG project in Louisiana in late March, citing initiatives \"to preserve cash and reinforce the resilience of our business.\"  In Australia's natural gas sector, Shell announced in April the final investment decision (FID) on the US$6.4-billion Surat Gas Project in Queensland.

Venezuela exported just a hair over 450,000 bpd of crude oil in May--just 18 cargoes.The 17-year low is attributed in part to the U.S. sanctions which has turned out to be akin to a game of whack-a-mole, with new shippers willing to ship PDVSA almost as soon as the last batch were sanctioned.  The previous round of sanctions hit Rosneft subsidiaries. A Mexico company, Libre Abordo, was another company willing to trade oil with Venezuela, but the company declared bankruptcy on Sunday, claiming that the United States had spearheaded an international political campaign against it, causing it to lose more than $90 million.Libre Abordo said that Maduro had canceled the oil for food swap arrangement.The United States is having a hard time squashing Venezuela's oil exports to zero with Iran sending five tankers of fuel to the struggling country, with Iran unconcerned about running afoul of sanctions against Venezuela since its own crude oil is sanctioned as well.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Cristobal, the tropical storm that formed earlier this week, is gathering strength, threatening parts of Mexico and Central America with floods but has yet to reach the offshore platforms in the U.S. section of the Gulf of Mexico, if it reaches them at all.AccuWeather reports Cristobal was moving at a maximum sustained speed of 45 mph and after it was upgraded to a tropical storm it became a record-breaker: the earliest recorded third named storm system in the Atlantic during hurricane season.Meanwhile, oil companies active in the Gulf of Mexico are monitoring storm developments and taking early precautionary measures, Reuters reported. Shell, Chevron, Exxon, BP, Hess Corp, and Murphy Oil, the report said, were not, however, evacuating platform staff yet.According to the National Hurricane Center, Cristobal will weaken to a tropical depression in the middle of this week before strengthening to a storm again around Friday and continuing to strengthen on Saturday. Early next week, it could make landfall in Louisiana, according to the forecast, crossing oil-producing parts of the Gulf of Mexico.The Gulf of Mexico accounts for some 17 percent of U.S. oil production. In 2018, hurricane Michael shut in production of more than 700,000 bpd for a few days. The year before, however, hurricane season was a lot more devastating: total losses for the oil industry--production and refining--hit US$200 billion, which became the highest storm bill in history. Last year was relatively mild hurricane-wise for the oil industry but there were evacuations in July, ahead of a storm that wasn't even named.This year there will be fewer evacuations if such are necessary. The rig count in the Gulf has fallen from over 20 in April to just 12 in the last week of May. There have, however, been Covid-19 related evacuations from Gulf platforms that, according to the Wall Street Journal, could threaten the profitability of some large projects.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

No details were released about this particular call, although the OPEC+ cuts were one of the topics discussed.OPEC+ is currently producing 9.7 million bpd less than a baseline agreed in early April. For most OPEC+ members, the baseline was their average daily production rate from October 2018 but for Saudi Arabia and Russia, it was their average daily in March, from which both had to cut to 8.5 million bpd. Yet Saudi Arabia said it would cut a million bpd deeper as a show of goodwill, while Nigeria and Iraq again lagged in compliance, per May data.The 9.7-million-bpd cuts were to be in effect over May and June, after which they were to be eased to a total 7.7 million bpd, to stay in effect until the end of this year. From 2021, the caps would ease further to 5.8 million bpd, to remain in effect until the end of April 2022.Yet now there has been talk, backed by Saudi Arabia, to keep the caps at 9.7 million bpd beyond the end-June expiry of this phase of the deal. There were reports late last month that Russia's Alexander Novak was discussing the extension of the deeper cuts with oil companies. It remains to be seen whether they had agreed.OPEC+ was supposed to meet next week but the meeting may be moved to this week to give Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and Kuwait to make their next export allocations.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

Meanwhile, the EIA's estimates were for more muted, with the industry body reporting last week that the inventories had climbed by 7.9 million barrels.WTI was trading up on Tuesday afternoon prior to the API's data release as OPEC pushed up the timeline for its meeting to discuss the future of the group's current oil production cut plans which are set to expire at the end of June. Indications are that Saudi Arabia hopes to extend the cuts in some form until the end of the year, while Russia is rumored to prefer an extension of a month or two at most,Either way, the market likes the idea of more cuts, with the understanding that cutting production through June will be insufficient to draw down the global glut that is weighing on prices and taxing storage capacity,Oil production in the United States has now fallen from 13.1 million bpd on March 13 to 11.4 million bpd for May 22, according to the Energy Information Administration--a drop of 1.7 million bpd--more than OPEC's production cut agreement from last year.At 4:16 pm EDT on Tuesday the WTI benchmark was trading up on the day by $1.42 (+4.01%) at $36.86. The price of a Brent barrel was trading up on Tuesday as well, by $1.31 (+3.42%), at $39.63.The API reported a build of 1.706 million barrels of gasoline for week ending May 29--compared to last week's 1.120-barrel build. This week's draw compares to analyst expectations for a 1.0 million-barrel build for the week.Distillate inventories were up by 5.917 million barrels for the week, compared to last week's 6.907-million-barrel build, while Cushing inventories saw a draw of 2.2 million barrels.At 4:37 pm EDT, WTI was trading at $36.93 while Brent was trading at $39.66.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "China has given the go-ahead to plans for a huge $20-billion refinery and petrochemical complex in the Shandong province, the home of the country's independent refiners, Reuters reported on Tuesday, citing two industry sources familiar with the approval process.The mega petrochemical complex has been years in the planning, but now it looks like the world's top oil importer is looking to spend money on oil infrastructure in order to reinvigorate the economy hit by the coronavirus.China's National Development & Reform Commission (NDRC) approved the Shandong Yulong Petrochemical project on Monday, Reuters' sources said.The complex in the Shandong province - where most of China's independent refiners, the so-called teapots, are based - is expected to host now the mega project which analysts expect to become operational at some point at the end of 2024. Shandong Yulong Petrochemical will have an oil refinery with a capacity to process 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) and an ethylene plant producing 3 million tons per year. According to Reuters' sources, the investment in the project will be some US$19.7 billion (140 billion Chinese yuan).Some independent refiners in Shandong have struggled in recent months after huge refineries such as Hengli Petrochemical and Zhejiang Petrochemical began operations last year.The Shandong Yulong Petrochemical project, while helping China's petrochemicals industry by reducing imports, could exacerbate the glut of refined petroleum products in the country, according to Reuters.Meanwhile, China's crude oil imports are set to increase by 2 percent in 2020, despite COVID-19, thanks to the low oil prices, according to a research think-tank affiliated with state oil giant China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC).  Last month, China's National People's Congress (NPC), the most important policy-setting annual event in the Communist country, didn't set an annual target for economic growth because of \"great uncertainty\" of the recovery from the coronavirus.

A week after the new agreement entered into force on May 1, Iraq was still negotiating with oil majors about which oilfields would need to cut production.As part of the OPEC+ deal, Iraq needs to cut around 1 million barrels per day (bpd) of its production, which stood at 4.585 million bpd in March 2020, as per OPEC's secondary sources in its latest Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR).Yet, Iraq was said to have told some of its Asian oil buyers in early May that it would not send the full contractual volumes requested for June. This could be a sign that even OPEC's least compliant member is trying to play its part this time, as oil prices are so low that they are devastating Iraq's primary budget income, oil revenues.According to a Reuters survey, OPEC failed to fully comply with its share of the cuts in May, and Iraq, as well as another serial laggard in compliance, Nigeria, failed again to deliver the cuts they had promised. Considering the very high share of oil revenues in its budget, Iraq should in theory be one of the most motivated producers in OPEC to see oil prices much higher than they currently are.Iraq's oil revenues in May rose from April, despite the fact that it sold fewer barrels of oil last month, AFP reported on Tuesday, citing oil ministry data. Iraq earned US$2.09 billion from oil sales in May, up from just US$1.4 billion in April, when prices had collapsed.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

The damage, which unsealed the hermetically sealed tank, itself followed a breakage in the supports of the tank that had \"served their purpose with no fail for more than 30 years,\" the metals giant also said.At the moment, the company is collecting the fuel from the river, but it has already spilled into another river as well, according to Rosprirodnadzor, the country's federal environmental authority. Norilsk Nickel said it had collected some 100 tons of diesel fuel.\"It can already be said now that it will take decades for the restoration of the ecological balance of the affected Norilo-Pyasinsky water system,\" said the head of the federal fishing agency, Rosribolov. Dmitry Klokov added that the event is nothing short of an ecological catastrophe.The head of Rosprirodnadzor, Svetlana Radionova, however, noted that the security at the Norilsk Nickel facility--a thermal power plant--had initially refused to let in inspectors sent to investigate the spill. She added that the inspectors had started their work despite lack of direct access to the site of the tank breakage and a fire that also occurred post-spill after a car passing by caught fire. The damage to the rivers and the soil in the area have yet to be calculated.The situation is being treated as an emergency situation, with one local nonprofit official noting that any spill of oil and oil productions into a body of water that is over 5,000 tons must be treated as a federal-level emergency, which has not happened with the Norilsk incident.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

In 2018, Brazil saw strong growth in hydropower and renewables other than hydropower, lifting the share of non-fossil fuels in the energy mix from 37 percent in 2017 to 39 percent in 2018.According to BP's projections, Brazil's energy mix will continue to shift toward non-fossil fuels as hydropower, renewable energy, and nuclear power are expected to account for nearly 50 percent of the energy mix by 2040, up from 43 percent in 2017.The share of renewable energy alone in Brazil's power generation is set to double to one third in 2040, BP's latest energy outlook on Brazil says.Apart from being a large crude oil producer--which has just topped the 3 million bpd production mark for the first time ever--Brazil is a major producer of biofuels, and the second-largest ethanol producer in the world after the United States.  According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), large hydropower plants account for around 80 percent of Brazil's electricity generation, which provides operational flexibility to the domestic electricity system.\"Access to electricity across the country is almost universal and renewables meet almost 45% of primary energy demand, making Brazil's energy sector one of the least carbon-intensive in the world,\" according to the IEA.

        "title": "Engineer Converts Tesla's Model 3 Into Cheaper Hybrid",
        "content": "An engineer from Austria has recreated an even cheaper Model 3 by converting Tesla's flagship electric vehicle into a hybrid by adding a two-cylinder gasoline engine and \"downgrading\" the battery pack.Frank Obrist from Lustenau, Austria, founder of engineering company OBRIST Powertrain, wants to make EVs more affordable. OBRIST Powertrain claims that the hybrid Tesla would have twice the range compared to the fully electric vehicle as designed and manufactured by Tesla.Obrist says that the Tesla Model 3 converted into a plug-in hybrid could have a range of more than 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) and it will be lighter than the original Model 3. With the small efficient gasoline engine and the smaller and cheaper lithium-ion battery, the 'hybrid Tesla Model 3' would be half the price compared to the original Model 3, according to the Austrian engineer, who says that he wants more people to be able to afford some sort of cleaner cars.Obrist has been working on his hyperhybrid concept for more than seven years, according to Edison Media magazine.While the hybrid concept could make a Tesla cheaper, it kind of defeats the purpose of Tesla's fully electric vehicles designed to help fight rising global emissions.  Tesla, for its part, has been beating production and delivery records in recent months, despite the initial hiccups and \"production hell\" in 2018 when Model 3 was being rolled out.  In October, Tesla surprised the market with an unexpected profit for the third quarter of 2019, and achieved a record number of around 97,000 deliveries globally in Q3. In the outlook provided in the Q3 2019 update, Tesla said about 2019 global deliveries that \"deliveries should increase sequentially and annually, with some expected fluctuations from seasonality. We are highly confident in exceeding 360,000 deliveries this year.\"  In Q4 2019, Tesla produced a record 105,000 vehicles and delivered a record 112,000 vehicles, the company said on Friday. Full-year 2019 deliveries were around 367,500 vehicles, in line with Tesla's own guidance and beating analyst expectations, which sent the stock's closing price at an all-time high on Friday.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "title": "Report: U.S. Should Cut Fossil Fuel Emissions From Buildings",
        "content": "States across the United States, including those that have pledged huge reductions in their greenhouse gas emissions, should not overlook the goal of reducing the use of fossil fuels in buildings, as this is a major part of emissions, a report from the Rocky Mountain Institute, cited by Reuters, showed on Monday.According to the report from the non-profit organization promoting clean energy, states in the northeast with ambitious climate goals--including New York, New Jersey, and Massachusetts--are unlikely to achieve their emission reduction targets unless they reduce fossil fuel consumption in buildings.Those cleaner-energy targets \"cannot be achieved without removing fossil fuels from buildings,\" Reuters quoted the RMI report as saying.Cities in some states, notably California and Massachusetts, have started to enact plans and laws to require that all new buildings be fully electrified with no natural gas use.In July, the city council in Berkeley, California, passed an ordinance requiring all new homes to be all-electric with no gas hook-ups beginning in January 2020. Berkeley's primary motivation for the gas hook-up ban was to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote the use of clean energy.  Boston, Massachusetts, is \"transitioning to zero-net carbon new construction,\" according to its most recent climate action plan.The Rocky Mountain Institute said last year that clean, electric buildings could not only cut greenhouse gas emissions, but also save money in new construction.The American Gas Association (AGA) disagrees, and it has published an analysis prepared for AGA by ICF, which found that \"policy-driven electrification would increase the average residential household energy-related costs (amortized appliance and electric system upgrade costs and utility bill payments) of affected households by between $750 and $910 per year, or about 38 percent to 46 percent.\"Most recently, AGA said last month that the industry could be part of the solution, and help emissions reduction through the use of emerging natural gas direct use technologies and the development of renewable natural gas.

        "content": "Shares in Saudi Aramco slumped on Monday to their lowest price since the Kingdom's oil giant made its debut on the stock market nearly a month ago, as investors are wary of Aramco's shares and Gulf assets amid heightened tensions in the Middle East and fears of a U.S.-Iran conflict in the region.Although oil prices have soared since the U.S. assassinated one of Iran's most powerful and visible military leader, Qassem Soleimani, concerns about an imminent Iranian retaliation is keeping investors away from assets in the Gulf region, including from shares in Saudi Aramco.Early on Monday, Aramco's shares slumped to US$9.08 (34.05 Saudi riyals) on the Tadawul--their lowest level since the world's biggest and most profitable oil company made its market debut on December 11.Since a recent high of US$10.32 (38.70 riyals), shares in Aramco have dropped nearly 11 percent, according to Reuters estimates.Aramco's shares still trade above the final offer price of US$8.53 (32 riyals) in the initial public offering (IPO), which valued the company at US$1.7 trillion.A week after Saudi Aramco started trading on the stock market, its shares ended the trading week in Saudi Arabia among the top losers, and wiped out a third of the rally at the start of the blockbuster IPO.On its second day of trading, Saudi Aramco hit the US$2-trillion valuation that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has been after for years, but analysts say that size is not everything and governance issues will continue to weigh on the Kingdom's oil giant.As Aramco began its life as a public company, some analysts are still wondering how the Kingdom's oil giant will ease foreign investors' concerns about transparency and corporate governance risk, considering that Saudi Arabia's rulers will continue to call the shots.Analysts have also warned investors that Saudi Aramco may not be a good play amid heightened tensions in the Middle Eastern region and increased risk of attacks from Iran.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Turkey and Libya could use the services of international companies for their joint oil and gas exploration plans in the Mediterranean, Reuters reports, citing Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan.Erdogan's statement comes amid attempts by Turkey to restore close relations with Libya. These efforts resulted in a deal that set up a maritime corridor from Turkey's southern coast to Libya's northeast shores.The move was followed by vocal protests from Greece and Cyprus, with Greece expelling the Libyan ambassador and lodging a complaint against Turkey at the United Nations. For Greece, the corridor is a power grab on the part of its neighbor in the resource-rich Eastern Mediterranean.The European Union is on Greece's side. Another Reuters report from December said that the union will come out with a statement rejecting the deal on the grounds of it breaking international maritime law.To make matters more interesting, the Libyan parliament has also rejected the deal, which Erdogan made with the Prime Minister of the Government of National Accord. While the GNA is the Libyan government that the West and the UN recognizes, the Libyan parliament supports an alternative government based in eastern Libya.The Eastern Mediterranean has drawn the attention of governments in the region after a few significant natural gas discoveries, among them the Zohr field in Egypt, the Leviathan field in Israel, and a few smaller but still sizeable discoveries off the coast of Cyprus. Just recently, the island greenlit a consortium involving Eni and Total to drill for gas in a new part of its exclusive economic zone.Cyprus sees Turkey's increased activity in the region as infringement of its territorial rights, but that has not made President Erdogan any less determined to pursue his exploration plans. However, Egypt and Israel have also started worrying about the implications of a Turkey-Libya drilling agreement. Both spoke against the deal, with Egypt calling it illegal and not binding, and Israel warning it could threaten the stability of the region.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

To this end, the HMS Montrose and the HMS Defender will be deployed in the region again, after last year they escorted UK-flagged ships through the Strait of Hormuz following the seizing of an Iranian oil tanker by Gibraltar with the help of the UK that angered Tehran.In retaliation, Iran captured a UK-flagged vessel in the Strait of Hormuz. The deployment of the HMS Montrose and the HMS Defender followed, with the UK and the United States urging other countries to join a coalition for the protection of vessels sailing through the vital oil chokepoint.Since then, UK-Iran tensions have been defused, after London released the Iranian tanker and Tehran reciprocated the gesture. Yet now, with Iran threatening to retaliate for the U.S. assassination of the leader of the Quds force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Qassem Soleimani and with Iraq's parliament voting in favor of the withdrawal of all foreign troops from its territory, tensions are running high again.According to Reuters, Wallace called his U.S. counterpart, Mark Esper, and advised restraint.\"Under international law, the United States is entitled to defend itself against those posing an imminent threat to their citizens,\" Wallace said in what could be construed as defence of the targeted air strikes that killed Soleimani and prompted a hostile verbal response from Tehran and anti-American demonstrations in Iraq.Oil prices have been trending higher as a result of the latest developments, with Brent crude breaking the $70 ceiling for the first time in several months and West Texas Intermediate moving closer to $65 a barrel.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

Analysts had expected a decline of 3.167 million barrels, after the EIA reported a draw of 5.5 million barrels for the week to December 20. At 429.9 million barrels, U.S. crude oil inventories are at the five-year seasonal average.In gasoline the EIA reported an inventory increase of 3.2 million barrels for the week to December 27, up from a 2-million-barrel build for the previous week. Gasoline production averaged 10.2 million barrels daily during the period, compared with 10.3 million bpd a week earlier.In distillate fuels the authority estimated an inventory increase of 8.8 million barrels, which compared with a decline of 200,000 barrels a week earlier. Distillate fuel production averaged 5.3, compared with 5.4 million bpd a week earlier.Refineries processed 17.3 million bpd in the last week of 2019, compared with 17 million bpd a week earlier. Imports of crude oil averaged 6.4 million bpd.Oil prices were already trending higher when the EIA released its weekly petroleum status report, pushed up by news about a U.S. air strike in Baghdad that killed a high-ranking Iranian military commander. This is the latest move in a fast escalation in the Middle East that has already sparked worry about the security of supply from the world's number-one exporting region.Meanwhile, the EIA said earlier this week that U.S. oil production had hit a record 12.66 million barrels daily in October, with weekly estimates suggesting this could have risen further in the months since October to over 13 million bpd.At the time of writing, Brent crude was trading at $68.69 a barrel, with West Texas Intermediate at 63.27 a barrel, both up by more than 3 percent since yesterday's close.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Exxon won't have to pay a $3-million fine the U.S. Treasury Department imposed on the supermajor for doing business with Rosneft amid a growing load of U.S. sanctions against Russia.The Wall Street Journal reports that a federal judge this week ruled against the fine, which followed the imposition of the first round of U.S. sanctions against Russia after its 2014 annexation of Crimea. According to the ruling, the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control had failed to give Exxon notice of how it interprets the sanctions, which was a violation of the Fifth Amendment.The reason for the fine was that the Rosneft official who signed the joint exploration contract with Exxon, chief executive Igor Sechin, was on the sanction list even though Rosneft itself was not.Exxon quit the project two years ago after its attempts to win a sanction waiver from Washington failed. Even so, the WSJ notes, the supermajor did not quit its legal fight against the fine.Exxon teamed up with Rosneft on Arctic oil exploration in 2011 and three years later the two announced they had struck oil. At the time, this was the northernmost oil well in the world, with Rosneft's Sechin expecting the deposit could hold as much as 100 million tons of crude. However, that's when the Crimea annexation came followed by the sanctions and activity around the Universitetskaya-1 well wound down.Rosneft is still active in the region, however, with drilling plans in place for more deposits in the Kara Sea where the Universitetskaya-1 well was drilled.Exxon, meanwhile, remains a partner to the Russian major in the Sakhalin-1 offshore project, which was exempted from sanctions. The two got embroiled in a dispute started by Rosneft, which claimed the Exxon-led consortium operating the project had unjustly enriched itself, but settled in 2018, when the consortium agreed to pay the Russian company $230 million out of court.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

The Qara Dagh and Sarta blocks that Chevron purchased in part were disputed blocks. The blacklisting, however, have too few teeth to persuade Chevron to drop its Kurdish pursuits.Chevron had already stopped its Kurdistan activities in October 2017 after an independence referendum created further tensions between the Kurdistan region and the central Iraqi government in Baghdad. At the time, Iraqi government forces had seized all oilfields around Kirkuk, taking 350,000 bpd of oil production offline. The oilfields had been under Kurdish control since 2014.

The EIA's estimates reported an even larger draw of 11.5 million barrels for that week.Oil prices were down on the day prior to the afternoon data release, but were up week on week after this weekend saw US airstrikes in Iraq that killed an Iranian military general Qassem Soleimani, drawing threats from Iran and causing foreign oil companies to evacuate Iraq.At 2:00 pm EST, the WTI benchmark was trading down $0.63 (-1.00%) at $62.64--roughly $1.58 per barrel above than last week's levels. The price of a Brent barrel was also trading down on Tuesday, by $0.78 (-1.13%), at $68.13-$2.13 per barrel more than last week's prices.

        "content": "Rising U.S. crude oil production weighed on oil prices throughout 2019, and combined with the weak demand growth last year, booming American oil output resulted in lower average oil prices in 2019 compared to 2018, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Tuesday.Brent Crude prices averaged US$64 a barrel last year, which was US$7 per barrel lower than the international benchmark's 2018 average price. The price of WTI Crude averaged US$57 per barrel in 2019, also US$7 a barrel lower than in 2018, EIA's data showed.  Oil prices traded in a narrow range last year, as continuously growing U.S. production and weakening demand growth offset bullish factors such as OPEC's ongoing production cuts and geopolitical flare-ups in the Middle East. The Brent price range last year was just US$20 a barrel--the narrowest range in which the benchmark has traded since 2003, according to the EIA. WTI Crude prices ranged between US$47 and US$66 per barrel.Despite the narrowest trading range in more than half a decade, last year saw the largest single-day price spike since 2008--this happened on the first trading day following the attacks on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities in the middle of September which cut off some 5 percent of the daily global supply for weeks.The price hike was short-lived amid assurances from the Saudis that they would quickly restore supply and amid the prospects of very weak demand growth as the U.S.-China trade war raging.Booming U.S. production also likely limited the impact of the attacks on oil prices, the EIA said. America's crude oil production also likely offset the efforts of OPEC and its Russia-led allies to curtail supply to support prices, as well as the U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela's crude oil exports.   The EIA expects U.S. crude oil production to have averaged 12.3 million bpd in 2019, easily making the U.S. the world's top crude oil producer.

        "content": "Rising petroleum exports and diminishing crude and oil product imports helped the U.S. post its lowest trade deficit in three years in November, government data showed on Tuesday.The U.S. monthly international trade deficit declined to US$43.1 billion in November, from US$46.9 billion in October, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and the U.S. Census Bureau.  Total U.S. exports of goods and services increased by 0.7 percent to US$208.6 billion in November, while imports of goods and services decreased by 1.0 percent to US$251.7 billion.  Crude oil imports dropped by US$132 million and other petroleum product imports fell by US$410 million in November from October, according to the detailed imports data.U.S. imports of crude oil in November--adjusted for seasonality and inflation--dropped to their lowest level since records began in 1994, according to AFP.In November last year, America's total petroleum trade surplus increased to US$800 million to hit the highest petroleum surplus ever recorded, according to MarketWatch estimates of the data.The narrower trade deficit in November reflects reduced overall U.S. imports amid the trade war in China, but it also reflects the growing significance of exports of crude oil and petroleum products and the diminishing oil imports in U.S. trade.According to EIA data, the United States exported more crude oil and petroleum products than it imported in September 2019--the first month in which America was a net petroleum exporter since monthly records began in 1973. In September 2019, the U.S. exported 89,000 bpd more crude oil and petroleum products than it imported, due to surging U.S. crude oil production and the lifting of export restrictions in 2015, and to continuously growing oil products output and exports, the EIA said.Just a decade ago, the U.S. was importing 10 million bpd more crude oil and petroleum products than it was exporting.  Total U.S. crude oil and petroleum net exports are expected to average 570,000 bpd in 2020 compared with average net imports of 490,000 bpd in 2019, according to EIA's latest Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO).

Libya is exempted from the OPEC+ production cuts due to its fragile security situation, and recent flare-ups show that OPEC and its partners were right to take Libya out of the production cuts equation and not rely on it for consistency in production.Libya's oil production was volatile in the spring and summer after eastern strongman General Khalifa Haftar--whose forces control most of Libya's oilfields--ordered in early April his Libyan National Army to march on the capital Tripoli.Related: Oil Giant Sees Stock Soar 20% On Unexpected Oil FindTwo outages at the biggest oil field, Sharara, in one month forced Libya's oil production down to below 1 million bpd in the first week of August--the lowest level in five months.Libya's crude oil production stabilized and even increased in September, October, and November, reaching 1.188 million bpd in November, up by 23,000 bpd compared to October, according to OPEC's secondary sources.Libya's December production, however, is expected to have dropped from November, after NOC declared a force majeure for a few days in early December on the Mellitah crude blend loadings because of an unlawful closure of a valve on the export pipeline from the El Feel oilfield to Mellitah.

        "content": "Construction work on the Coastal GasLink pipeline in British Columbia will resume this week after a holiday break despite an eviction notice served to the company that leads the project by a local First Nation.In a tweet, the company said \"This week, we'll continue to remobilize construction crews across the right-of-way in anticipation of work resumption. Clearing, grading, workforce accommodation establishment & other activities are expected to continue as scheduled.\"The Canadian Press reports that Coastal GasLink will begin with safety refresh meetings and then restart construction of the pipeline. The company announced its plans in a statement that came on the heels of news that the Wet'suwet'en First Nation sent Coastal GasLink a letter demanding that it remove its workers from a part of its territory that they were trespassing on.The letter came several days after the Supreme Court of British Columbia granted Coastal GasLink an injunction against members of the Wet'suwet'en nation and other opponents of the pipeline.The Coastal GasLink project is majority owned by TC Energy, but the company recently agreed to sell a 65-percent stake in the pipeline to KKR and the Alberta Investment Management Corporation.The infrastructure is vital for the LNG Canada project--the first of its kind to be built in Canada--to which it will supply natural gas from Dawson Creek, close to the border with Alberta, to Kitimat, where the liquefaction trains of LNG Canada will be built.LNG Canada is a project of Shell, with a 40-percent stake, Malaysia's Petronas with 25 percent, PetroChina with 15 percent, Mitsubishi with 15 percent, and South Korea's Kogas with 5 percent.The facility, which is expected to become operational before 2025, will initially have two liquefaction trains, each with a capacity of 6.5 million tons of LNG with the prospect of adding another two trains at a later stage, bringing the total capacity of the facility in Kitimat, in northern British Columbia, to as much as 26 million tons annually.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Exxon's refinery at Fos-sur-Mer in France was blocked by a strike of union workers on Tuesday as part of a massive French strike against a proposed pension reform, and shipments at the 140,000-barrels-per-day refinery are also blocked, the French unit of the U.S. supermajor told Reuters on Tuesday.The month-long strikes in France against the government's plan for a pension reform have now reached oil refineries around the country, but officials and oil companies say there will be no shortage of fuel.According to the CGT trade union, its unionized workers at Exxon's Fos-sur-Mer and Port Jerome have decided to go on strike.The Fos-sur-Mer refinery was blocked on Tuesday while Port Jerome, which has a processing capacity of 240,000 bpd, was operating normally early today, Exxon France told Reuters.Fos-sur-Mer accounts for 10 percent of France's refinery production, while the Port Jerome refinery processes 20 percent of the French refinery output.The CGT union has called for a \"total blockade\" of all oil refineries across France to force the government to withdraw plans to amend the pension system.The trade union has called for the blockade to begin on Tuesday, January 7, through Friday, January 10, so that no refined product would come out of any French refinery for 96 hours, one of the union's leaders at French oil major Total, Thierry Defresne, told French radio station Franceinfo.Defresne told Reuters that seven out of the eight refineries in France would be on strike for those 96 hours, and workers would not allow any shipments of refined products to come out of the refineries.Meanwhile, Total said on Monday, ahead of the massive strike, that it did not expect fuel shortages, as its gas stations are well stocked.While the trade union insists that it will block fuel supplies out of refineries, an industry source told Reuters that France imports around 50 percent of the fuel which is sold in the country, so the impact of a massive strike would not be as severe as it would have been if all products were processed domestically.

        "content": "A plan announced by Mexico's President to re-route a pipeline under construction in order to go around indigenous lands has sparked concern among some in the industry regarding future energy projects.BNN Bloomberg cites analysts as saying the plan could create a risky precedent for indigenous communities that are already protesting a number of pipeline projects. This has already led to a decline in investments.President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador announced the plan to re-route the pipeline last week. Currently under construction, the project managed by TC Energy (former TransCanada) will transport natural gas from Veracruz to Puebla and Hidalgo across 176 miles that include an area that is considered sacred by several local communities in the state of Puebla.\"Even if we have to pay, the gas pipeline will not go through the sacred hills,\" Lopez Obrador said, as quoted by Reuters, over the weekend, after a consultation with four local indigenous communities.\"They are trying to avoid any legal problems, and international controversies,\" Wood Mackenzie gas analyst Rodrigo Rosas told Bloomberg.Indeed, anti-pipeline activism has turned into a trend in recent years. Indigenous communities in both the United States and Canada have been active in opposing several large-scale projects, including the Keystone XL pipeline, Dakota Access, and, in Canada, the Trans Mountain expansion.However, not all agree that the re-routing of the Tuxpan-Tula pipeline in Mexico is a problem. In fact, some see it as good news.A Natural Gas Intel article by Andrew Baker quoted a Mexico-based energy consultant who said the re-routing could actually speed up the completion of the pipeline. This will in turn allow several power plants in the region to switch from more expensive fuel oil to cheap gas.\"They [the Mexico state power utility CFE] need it to be done,\" Gonzalo Monroy said. \"I think that it was actually a very pragmatic decision by Lopez Obrador, saying if they have to pay extra for the rerouting, so be it.\"By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Amid the rising tension in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia's tanker and logistics group Bahri has suspended transits through the Strait of Hormuz, the world's most important oil chokepoint which is in close proximity to Iranian waters, the Wall Street Journal reports, as the market is digesting the retaliatory Iranian attack on U.S. troops in Iraq.Over the past week, the tension in the Middle East and around the Strait of Hormuz has noticeably increased after the U.S. killed the top Iranian general of the Al Quds forces, Qassem Soleimani. Global markets and oil investors were waiting for the Iranian retaliation, which came late on Tuesday with a ballistic missiles attack on U.S. bases in Iraq.  Apart from the Saudi tanker group, Brazil's Petrobras has also suspended transits of oil tankers through the Strait of Hormuz, according to the WSJ.The Strait of Hormuz is the most important oil chokepoint in the world with daily oil flows averaging 21 million bpd, or the equivalent of 21 percent of global petroleum liquids consumption. According to EIA estimates, 76 percent of the crude oil and condensate that moved through the Strait of Hormuz last year went to Asian markets, with China, India, Japan, South Korea, and Singapore the top destinations.After the killing of Soleimani last week, the British Royal Navy is now escorting UK-flagged vessels going through the world's most vital oil choke point.While tanker owners and operators and countries move to protect their shipments in the Middle East, the energy minister of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Suhail al-Mazrouei, said in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday that he doesn't see immediate risk to oil transits through the Strait of Hormuz.\"This is definitely an escalation between the United States, which is an ally, and Iran, which is a neighbor, and the last thing we want is more tension in the Middle East,\" al-Mazrouei said on the sidelines of a conference, as carried by Reuters.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Kuwait expects its share of the oil production from the Neutral Zone that it shares with Saudi Arabia to be 250,000 bpd by the end of 2020 when production will have resumed after half a decade of hiatus because of a dispute.At the end of 2019, neighbors Saudi Arabia and Kuwait reached an agreement to resume oil production from the two oilfields they share in the Neutral Zone.The so-called Partitioned Neutral Zone (PNZ) was established between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait in 1922 to settle a territorial dispute between the two countries. As of 2015, the oil production capacity in the neutral zone stood at 600,000 bpd, equally divided between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, according to the EIA. Production from the zone averaged around 500,000 bpd just before the shutdown of the two oil fields, Khafji and Wafra, in 2014-2015.Operational differences and a worsening in bilateral relations led to the suspension of production back in 2015. The worsening came as Saudi Arabia renewed Chevron's concession for Wafra. According to the Kuwaiti side, Riyadh did that without consulting it.The two neighbors now have agreed to restart the two oilfields, which could put an additional 500,000 bpd-600,000 bpd on the oil market.\"Signing the Memorandum of Understanding means the return of production of 250,000 bpd...before the end of 2020,\" Reuters quoted Kuwait's Oil Minister Khaled al-Fadhel as telling Parliament on Thursday. According to the minister, the 250,000-bpd additional production capacity from the shared Neutral Zone will not impact Kuwait's compliance with the ongoing OPEC+ production cuts. OPEC and its Russia-led allies are set to review the current pact in March this year.Kuwait has been strictly complying with its share of the cuts, while Saudi Arabia has been going the extra mile every month and has cut much more than it had promised to.

According to the Ministry of Natural Resources, these will be companies with net assets worth no less than $43 million.China has been actively looking for ways to boost domestic oil and natural gas production to alleviate its dependence on imports. However, this has proved difficult to do relying only on the state-owned energy giants.The change, effective May 1 this year, has been eagerly awaited by the industry because although China is home to some 25.7 billion barrels of proven oil reserves, a lot of it is locked in geologically challenging formations. What's more, natural depletion at many of its developed oil fields is taking its toll, driving an overall decline in domestic oil production.\"China is accelerating the sector reform due to growing energy security concerns,\" an IHS Markit analyst told Reuters. \"Vitalising the industry by diversifying the participants, including foreign and private investors, is the focus of that reform.\"China currently imports about 70 percent of the crude oil it processes. That's too high a level for comfort, especially right now, with tensions running high in the Middle East, which is one of China's largest suppliers of crude. Developing domestic resources seems quite urgent.The change effected by Beijing will allow foreign companies to explore and develop oil and gas fields in China without setting up a joint venture with a Chinese company - a rule until now. This, according to Reuters, means the state oil giants will have practically have to cede some of the oil and gas assets they control by virtue of being state companies to private companies.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Due to continuously rising U.S. natural gas production, natural gas prices at the U.S. benchmark Henry Hub averaged US$2.57 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in 2019--the lowest annual average price since 2016, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Thursday.The average natural gas price last year was US$0.60 lower than the average Henry Hub price in 2018.  Monthly average prices at the key U.S. regional trading hubs hit their highest in February 2019, due to the winter season, and then they were relatively stable and low from April to December, the EIA has estimated.New pipelines to carry the growing volumes of natural gas out of the Permian partially eased the takeaway capacity constraints and pushed natural gas prices at the Waha hub in Texas higher in the latter part of the year, after six months in a row of average monthly prices lower than US$1/MMBtu--March through August.In early April 2019, prices at the Waha hub plummeted to record low negative levels, as pipeline constraints and problems at compressor stations at one pipeline stranded gas produced in the Permian.Across the U.S., lower natural gas prices spurred increased domestic natural gas consumption, especially in the electricity generation sector, as well as higher natural gas exports out of the U.S., setting a new liquefied natural gas (LNG) export record, the EIA said.Related: How To Short The World's Largest Oil CompanyAs several new LNG export facilities came online in 2019, U.S. LNG exports averaged an estimated 5.0 Bcf/d last year, surging by 69 percent annually, setting a new LNG export record, and making the United States the third-largest global LNG exporter, the EIA notes.The United States saw its net natural gas exports in the first half of 2019 more than double from the same period of 2018, thanks to more LNG export capacity coming online in recent months, the EIA said in October.The United States will be the global leader in newly-built LNG liquefaction capacity between 2019 and 2023, data and analytics company GlobalData said earlier in October 2019.

        "content": "Senegal's government has given the go-ahead to the development at its first oil project, the Sangomar offshore field, operated by Australia's Woodside Petroleum.The start of production from the $4.2-billion field, however, is still in the future. The members of the consortium that runs the project have yet to settle some differences.These, more specifically, center on FAR's claims that it was denied the right to pre-empt the sale of Conoco's 35-percent stake in Sangomar to Woodside. FAR is a small Australian player and now a minority shareholder in the Senegalese project. Woodside bought the 35 percent from Conoco for $350 million in 2016. The resolution of the dispute is expected this year, Reuters notes.Senegal is a relatively minor producer of oil but it could become a larger one once its offshore projects begin producing, which, according to the country's oil minister, should happen between 2022 and 2026.While oil was first discovered in the West African country in the early 1960s, in just three years, between 2014 and 2017, explorers tapped about 1 billion barrels of crude and 40 trillion cubic meters of gas. Most of these resources, however, are shared by Senegal and Mauritania.The IMF, which released the new discovery data, said \"Discoveries are important but will not lead to a major transformation of the economy, with hydrocarbons expected to make up not more than 5 percent of GDP.\"Currently, there are two large offshore projects under development in Senegal: the Greater Tortue Ahmeyim gas field, which is operated by BP and Kosmos Energy, and the Sangomar field, previously called SNE. Sangomar should produce some 100,000 bpd once it reaches its full capacity, according to the consortium.In 2017, FAR, which was conducting seismic exploration at the SNE block reported it may have discovered reserves of up to 1.5 billion barrels of crude, revising an earlier estimate of 641 million barrels. At the time, production was slated to begin in 2022 at a maximum daily rate of 140,000 bpd.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

The U.S. and Saudi Arabia blamed Iran for the attacks soon after September 14, and Iran vigorously denied any responsibility.The drone and missile attacks caused a fire at the Abqaiq oil processing facility and a production outage at the Khurais field, taking 5.7 million bpd in daily production offline. This caused a temporary spike in oil prices as Aramco struggled to restore production as quickly as possible.At the time, media reported that the White House had ordered the Pentagon to plan several alternatives for a response to the Saudi attacks. However, President Trump warned that steps were not to be taken before Riyadh decided how to respond to the attacks.\"No knee jerk reactions to this - it's very systematic - what happens with patience is it prevents stupid moves,\" an unnamed source familiar with the discussions told CNN a week after the attack.Related: The Real Reason The U.S. Is Interested In IranIndeed there were no knee jerk reactions to the attacks, but the report from the UN Security Council Yemen sanctions committee comes at a time of much heightened tension between the United States and Iran. Interestingly enough, an earlier media report on their work said they had been unable to corroborate Iran's involvement in the attacks.In December, the BBC reported on a leaked report compiled by the UN Secretary General, which said the investigators from the Security Council Yemen sanctions committee had failed to confirm that the drones and missiles used in the Saudi attacks were made in Iran.Now, according to the report Reuters had seen, \"The panel notes that Abqaiq and Khurais were approached respectively from a north/northwestern and north/northeastern direction, rather than from the south, as one would expect in the case of a launch from Yemeni territory.\" The investigators also said they doubted the missiles \"have a sufficient range to have been launched from Yemeni territory under the control of the Houthis.\"By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

Aasta Hansteen gas is transported through the Polarled pipeline to the Nyhamna terminal for further export to the UK, while condensate produced at the field is loaded into tankers and transported to the market. Aasta Hansteen is bringing gas from a new Norwegian gas province to the markets, operator Equinor says.The sandstones Wintershall Dea encountered in the second exploration well contain traces of gas, but nothing more, so the well is classified as dry, the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD) said in a statement on Wednesday.  In the same license, Wintershall struck gas in the first exploration well drilled in early 2018.Wintershall Dea is one of the largest operators on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS) and considers Norway as a core region, unlike many other major oil corporations which have been divesting assets offshore Europe's largest oil and gas producer. In one of the latest transactions, ExxonMobil signed a deal in September 2019 to sell its non-operated upstream assets in Norway to Var Energi AS for US$4.5 billion.The operators that stay offshore Norway are exploring for oil and gas in both mature areas and in frontier regions in the Barents Sea in the hopes of finding the next giant Johan Sverdrup which started pumping oil in early October 2019. With expected resources of 2.7 billion barrels of oil equivalent, Johan Sverdrup is one of the largest discoveries on the shelf ever made and one of the largest industrial projects in Norway for the next fifty years, according to Equinor.According to NPD, producers are barely halfway through producing Norway's vast oil and gas resources, with 47 percent of resources produced so far.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

TurkStream consists of two lines--one to carry gas for the Turkish market, and another to ship the gas further westward on to Bulgaria, Serbia, and potentially Italy and Hungary.The official launch of the pipeline in Istanbul was also attended by the prime ministers of Bulgaria and Serbia, Boyko Borissov and Aleksandar Vucic, respectively, as well as by Russia's Energy Minister Alexander Novak and Gazprom's management committee chairman Alexey Miller.\"It is important for Bulgaria to receive gas from different sources at competitive prices,\" Borissov said on Twitter after the ceremony.Bulgaria started receiving gas via Turkstream on January 1, while Serbia and North Macedonia began receiving the Russian gas on January 5.TurkStream extends Russia's dominance in gas supplies to Turkey and southeastern Europe and bypasses Ukraine, with which Russia has strained relations since the annexation of Crimea in 2014.  Russia and Ukraine reached a deal on the transit of Russian gas through Ukraine to Europe in the eleventh hour, preventing a potential gas supply crisis during the winter in Europe.Related: How Long Will The Oil Price Fear Premium Last?Commenting on the launch of TurkStream, Gazprom's Miller said in a statement:\"Firstly, taking into account exports via Blue Stream, we have paved the way for direct transit-free supplies to fully meet Turkey's needs for Gazprom's gas. Secondly, Europe now has a new and reliable route to receive Russian pipeline gas.\"\"There is no doubt that, thanks to all of this, our cooperation with our Turkish and European partners is shifting to a new level and is going to help improve energy security in the region,\" Miller added.Critics of Russia's energy policy, including the U.S., the Baltic states, Poland, and several other EU countries, say that it is Moscow's gas supply dominance that undermines Europe's energy security.

The armed suspected pirates attacked the oil dredging ship MV Ambika in the waterways of the Niger Delta.Attacks and kidnappings are nothing new in the oil-rich Niger Delta which, despite its oil wealth, hasn't been good to its local people who have not seen oil revenues transform their lives.The coasts off Nigeria and the Gulf of Guinea in general are prime targets for piracy in West Africa. Over the past year, piracy off the coasts in West Africa has seen a shift from oil piracy to kidnapping people. India, the most prolific source of maritime sailors in the region, has banned all Indian seafarers from working on vessels in Nigerian waters and in the Gulf of Guinea.  In one recent incident before the kidnapping from last week, a gang of pirates kidnapped in early December 19 sailors after waylaying and boarding a supertanker loaded with oil. Hong Kong-flagged crude supertanker the Nave Constellation, owned by Navios Maritime Acquisition Corporation, was boarded on December 3 while the ship was traveling through Nigerian waters. The attack occurred roughly 60-70 nautical miles south of Nigeria's Bonny Island Offshore Terminal, where the ship was stocked with cargo.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

It will target all energy companies and cover areas including project financing,  corporate financing, and underwriting, Business Green reported.\"Aligning financial flows with the goal of keeping temperature increases well below 2C, and preferably to 1.5C, was hard-wired into the Paris Climate Agreement for good reason,\" said Natasha Landell-Mills from one of the institutional investors backing the resolution, Sarasin & Partners. \"Continued financing of harmful fossil fuel activities puts this target at risk, with potentially devastating consequences for us all. And yet, this is precisely what is happening today, and Barclays is amongst the most prolific bank financiers globally of such activities.\"Not all banks are waiting for shareholder action, however. Goldman Sachs last month announced a commitment of $750 billion for sustainable projects, to be distributed over the next ten years. The bank also said it will curb its investments in the fossil fuel industry , cutting off all future investment in Arctic oil exploration and production.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "As part of the Trump Administration's ongoing efforts to accelerate the permitting process for oil pipelines and other large infrastructure projects, the White House released on Thursday a plan to cut the timelines for such projects by omitting the assessment of a project's climate impact.  The new plan is proposed by the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), and if it becomes law, it could be the first major amendment to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) in forty years.\"The proposed rule seeks to reduce unnecessary paperwork and delays, and to promote better decision-making consistent with NEPA's statutory requirements,\" Reuters quoted a CEQ fact sheet about the proposed rule it has seen.Under the new proposal, federal permitting agencies and regulators would not be obliged to assess and factor in the impact on climate of major infrastructure projects, including oil pipelines.The Administration is pushing to have the controversial Keystone XL finally approved, after U.S. President Donald Trump resurrected the project dumped by Obama.Keystone XL continues to face legal challenges, although the project got the go-ahead in August 2019 from a Nebraska court, which approved the alternative route after opponents disputed the original one. Indigenous and environmental groups still are challenging the second permit that the Trump Administration has issued for Keystone XL.In a presidential message on the 50th anniversary of the NEPA, President Trump said earlier this year:\"To improve Federal agency coordination and make environmental reviews and permitting processes far less time-consuming, I directed Federal agencies to implement a One Federal Decision policy for major infrastructure projects.\"\"Additionally, I directed the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) to modernize the Federal environmental review and decision-making process.  As a result, CEQ has conducted a thorough review of its NEPA implementing regulations and will soon issue a proposal to update those regulations to address the many concerns my Administration has heard from hardworking Americans, small businesses, and State and local officials,\" the message said on January 1.

        "content": "The United States is working closely with China to have it cut off altogether imports of Iranian crude oil, as the U.S. steps up sanctions pressure on the Iranian regime, U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, Steven Mnuchin, told Fox News' 'Sunday Morning Futures'.Despite the U.S. crackdown on Chinese tanker companies dealing with Iranian oil, China continues to import oil from the Islamic Republic, but in much smaller volumes than it used to, before the U.S. ended all waivers for all Iranian oil customers in May last year.  The U.S. has already cut off probably more than 95 percent of Iran's oil revenues, but China continues to be a big buyer of what Iranian oil exports are left, Mnuchin told Fox News.Referring to China's purchases of crude oil from Iran, the Treasury Secretary said:\"They've cut off all of the state companies from buying oil, and we're working closely with them to make sure that they cease all additional oil activities.\"The U.S. continues to target countries and companies which continue to do business with Iran and continue to import oil from Iran, Mnuchin reiterated, noting that everyone--Chinese or European--would face secondary sanctions if they buy oil from Iran.\"We actually sanctioned some of their shipping companies that were involved in the oil, and we will continue to pursue sanctions activities against China and anybody else around the world that continues to do business with them,\" Mnuchin told Fox News.The United States imposed in September 2019 sanctions on a number ofChinese tanker owning firms and executives for transporting Iranian oil in violation of the U.S. sanctions on the Islamic Republic.   Europe is complying with the U.S. sanctions on Iran because European firms know that they would be slapped with secondary sanctions if they don't, Mnuchin said.The reminder that the U.S. is going after anyone doing business with Iran comes after the most recent flare-up in the Middle East and the expanded sanctions on the Islamic Republic to include individuals and metals and construction companies.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Aramco has exercised the greenshoe option attached to its initial public offering, issuing another 450 million shares to raise an additional $3.8 billion, the company said as quoted by CNN.As a result, the already record-breaking IPO of the Saudi energy giant has been pushed up to a total $29.4 billion.Aramco listed 3 billion of its shares on the Tadawul exchange in early December and quickly touched the much-hyped $2-trillion valuation Crown Prince Mohammed was after when he decided to list a minority stake in the company.After that, however, the shares retreated, and last week took a nosedive on the renewed tension between the United States and Iran, which indirectly threatens the security of Saudi oil supply due to its proximity to Iran and the mutual hostility between the two largest countries in the Middle East.Using the greenshoe option, as CNN's Claire Duffy notes in her report on the news, is commonly used by issuers to keep the stock from falling below the issuing price. This, however, is not the case with Aramco. The additional shares were allocated to buyers before the listing and they will not be floated on Tadawul.Even so, the stock was down by 10 percent since the listing as of January 6. The top concern among investors is geopolitical right now, but this can change when the holding period instituted by the Saudi government for retail investors expires. The holding period is meant to prevent a quick selloff the moment Aramco's share price rises enough to be turned into a fat profit. Once it expires, six months after the listing, a selloff may still happen.Meanwhile, some analysts are still wondering how the Kingdom's oil giant will ease foreign investors' concerns about transparency and corporate governance risk, considering that Saudi Arabia's rulers will continue to call the shots. Yet these concerns would only come to the fore if Aramco decides to go through with an international listing, for which it is in no hurry.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Threats of cyber attacks on North America's electric network systems are growing, industrial cybersecurity firm Dragos said in a new report this week.  This year, the firm has identified two groups, Magnallium and Xenotime, which are increasingly probing to compromise electric assets in North America, expanding their targeting from the oil and gas sector to include electric assets.  \"This underscores the trend in threats expanding from single-vertical ICS operations to multi-vertical ICS operations we observe from adversaries targeting industrial entities,\" Dragos said in its report.  Another group, Parisite, identified in 2019, has been focusing on exploiting vulnerabilities in remote connectivity services and virtual private network (VPN) appliances to gain initial access to target industrial control systems (ICS) networks, Dragos said.\"The complete \"energy infrastructure sector\" (e.g., electric, oil and gas, etc.) of all countries are at risk as companies and utilities face multiple well-resourced ICS-focused adversaries,\" Dragos says.Cyber security experts, however, are not panicking because they believe that the power sector and grid networks, especially in North America, are beefing up their security and are more prepared to withstand cyber attacks.\"There's an incredible amount of awareness, a lot of work and a lot of dedicated people who are focused on that problem every day,\" Bernie Cowens, who was vice president and CISO of Pacific Gas and Electric in California, told Information Security Media Group in an interview.Last year, Microsoft security researcher Ned Moran said that an infamous Iranian hacker group may be targeting industrial control systems to cause major disruptions in power grids, oil refineries, and other physical energy assets, in an apparent sharpened focus on cyber warfare on critical industries.The U.S. is looking to strengthen cyber security at critical energy infrastructure. The U.S. Department of Energy is awarding millions of US dollars in research and development of next-generation tools and technologies aimed at improving the cybersecurity of the critical American energy infrastructure, including the electric grid and oil and natural gas infrastructure.

However, the only export oil pipeline out of landlocked South Sudan passes through its neighbor to the north, Sudan.  But then civil war in South Sudan broke out in 2013 that further complicated oil production. Currently, South Sudan pumps around 180,000 bpd.The government aims to hold an oil licensing round for 14 oil exploration blocks by the end of the first quarter of 2020.    \"Understanding the pollution damage will allow the country to put systems in place to prevent further damage as the country looks to ramp up production,\" South Sudan's Minister of Petroleum Awow Daniel Chuang said.   At the same time, South Sudan's President Salva Kiir said in August last year:\"I will not tolerate irresponsible activities in the oil sector.\"\"And while the government is eager to welcome new exploration and production, companies would be held to a high standard. The era of \"bad business\" was coming to an end,\" the president said.One of the world's newest countries must now reconcile the timing of the environmental audits with its ambitions to increase oil production.

        "content": "The Democratic Republic of Congo is considering taking over two oil licenses from an Israeli billionaire who is under U.S. sanctions for corrupt deals, and sell the exploration blocks to another operator, Bloomberg reports, quoting people familiar with the talks.  Israeli businessman and billionaire Dan Gertler, whose companies hold the licenses for exploring for oil on two blocks in Congo close to the border with Uganda, was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury in December 2017.Gertler \"has amassed his fortune through hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of opaque and corrupt mining and oil deals in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC),\" the Treasury said, when it slapped sanctions on the businessman and on dozens of companies he owns or is affiliated with. The sanctioned companies include Oil of DRCongo and two firms it manages, Caprikat Limited and Foxwhelp Limited, which hold the licenses for the two blocks.\"Gertler has used his close friendship with DRC President Joseph Kabila to act as a middleman for mining asset sales in the DRC, requiring some multinational companies to go through Gertler to do business with the Congolese state,\" the U.S. Treasury says.But now, Congo is reportedly looking to transfer those licenses to the state oil firm Sonahydroc and later sell them to another operator. Congo's government has been talking to UK-listed Tullow Oil, which has oil licenses in the Lake Albert area on the Ugandan side of the border, Bloomberg's sources said.According to two of those sources, France's Total and Italy's Eni have expressed interest in the Congo licenses in the past, but Eni told Bloomberg it wasn't interested, while a Total spokeswoman said that Total had quit Congo.   Gertler's firms could get some compensation for the two oil licenses, to the tune of US$150 million, but according to Bloomberg's sources and analysts, a transaction would turn out to be complex because Gertler and his firms are under U.S. sanctions.

        "content": "Shell is looking for buyers of its Anacortes refinery in Washington, unnamed sources told Reuters, adding that if a sale takes place it would leave Shell's refining operations in North America concentrated in the Gulf Coast.The sale would be part of a divestment program announced by the Anglo-Dutch supermajor. It envisages the offloading of $5 billion worth of assets last year and this year, each.Shell already sold one other U.S. refinery last year, in Martinez, California. The deal, with independent refiner PBF Energy Inc, will see the supermajor get up to $1 billion.Another refinery, this one in Canada, is also up for sale. That's the 75,000-bpd Sarnia refinery of Shell in Ontario.If Shell finds a buyer for the 144,000-bpd Anacortes facility, this will leave it with three refineries in the United States--two in Louisiana with a combined capacity of half a million barrels daily, and one in Texas with a capacity of 340,000 bpd.Reuters later reported that the Anacortes refinery is the seventh one that has been put up for sale in the United States. The seven account for 5 percent of refining capacity in the country.Buyers, however, are difficult to find for a number of reasons. These include unfavorable locations, a concern among energy companies about falling refining margins, and the competition prospects given the pending restart of refineries in the Caribbean.The margins problem, according to analysts, stems from the fact that all refineries are now trying to produce fuels compliant with the new IMO sulfur emissions regulations effective January 1 and this is eating into profits. The U.S. renewable fuel standard is not helping, either.\"When some of your really big companies have stopped buying refineries, that really slows things down,\" a Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. told Reuters.\"Refiners don't want to overpay for an asset with environmental liabilities that might require unknown capital expenditure to meet future requirements,\" according to Matt Flanagan, an executive from energy advisory firm Opportune.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "The largest oil hedge in the world cost Mexico \"around $1 billion\" for 2020, Mexico's Finance Minister Arturo Herrera said on Thursday, according to Reuters. Herrera had said the cost of the hedge would be revealed on Thursday.Herrera disclosed the rough cost of the hedge at the prompting of Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador.For 2019, Mexico spent $1.23 billion, locking in a fixed price of $55 per barrel. Herrera failed to disclose the actual figure in order to keep market players in the dark as to when Mexico was hedging. The average cost of the hedging program is $1.2 billion, according to Deputy Finance Minister Gabriel Yorio.Under this hedging program, Mexico buys put options from Wall Street investment banks to sell hundreds of millions of barrels of oil. With these put options, Mexico is granted the right--but not the obligation--to sell its oil at a predetermined price for the upcoming year.In 2015 and 2016, Mexico made out like bandits when oil prices tanked, as the contracted upfront price for oil ended up being much higher than market price.Mexico's hedge is the largest annual oil hedge in the world, and is a major source of revenue for Mexico, accounting for 4% of the country's GDP. The hedge typically ranges between 200 million and 300 million barrels.The 2020 hedge locked in a price of $49 per barrel, according to Reuters--significantly lower than the $55 per barrel price that it hedged at for last year.The Maya crude blend--Mexico's flagship grade--is currently trading at $54.81 per barrel--down from $64.48 in April 2019, but up from $45.05 in August. This year's hedging formula went through an overhaul after two decades no changes, slowing the hedge in the latter part of 2019, causing some to question whether the hedge would happen at all.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

North America will contribute some 51 percent to all new crude oil trunk or transmission pipeline additions through 2023, with expected combined new-build crude oil pipeline length of 14,344 kilometers (8,913 miles) by that year.In North America alone, as many as 29 new-build crude oil pipelines are expected to begin operation by 2023. Of those, 16 pipelines are planned projects and 13 are in early-stage announcement, Varun Ette, Oil and Gas Analyst at GlobalData, said.\"The Liberty Oil Project is the longest upcoming announced pipeline in the region with a length of 2,172.2km,\" Ette noted.A lot of crude oil pipelines are also planned in the Permian in the U.S., where crude oil production outpaced takeaway capacity in 2018.A total of nine intrastate crude oil pipeline projects have been announced or are under construction in the Permian with in-service dates between 2019 and 2021, the EIA said last year. The pipelines are expected to ease the Permian takeaway capacity constraints as they move crude oil throughout Texas and Louisiana.In terms of combined length of announced and planned new oil pipelines in the world, Asia comes second after North America, followed by the Middle East, Africa, the former Soviet Union (FSU), South America, and Europe, according to GlobalData.Asia will account for 16 percent of the global new crude oil pipeline length over the next three years, with six oil pipelines expected to come on line by 2023. The Gwadar-Kashgar pipeline between Pakistan and China will be the largest in the Asian region in the next three years.

        "content": "Slowing U.S. crude oil production growth will likely lead to a new wave of consolidation across the U.S. shale patch, where the big players will acquire the 'smaller guys', shale pioneer Mark Papa told Reuters in an interview published on Tuesday.Papa, who is also now also non-executive board chairman at the world's biggest oilfield services group Schlumberger, expects U.S. production to grow at a much slower pace in 2020 than the EIA predicts.In its December Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO), the EIA expects U.S. crude oil production to grow by 900,000 bpd this year to average 13.2 million bpd. This year's growth will be slower than the 1.6 million bpd increase in 2018 and the 1.3 million bpd rise in 2019, according to EIA's estimates.  Papa, however, sees U.S. oil production rising by just 400,000 bpd this year. Over the next five years until 2025, U.S. crude oil production growth could be between 100,000 bpd and 500,000 bpd, depending on the oil prices, according to Papa.The shale pioneer expects U.S. shale to be a less powerful force on the global oil market over the next decade.\"I'm not saying that the U.S. shale oil will go away but I'm saying it will become a less powerful force as we go through the 2020s than it was in the previous decade,\" Papa told Reuters.U.S. shale producers are breaking even at an average U.S. oil price of US$55 a barrel, according to Papa. As capital availability to smaller companies is scarce while investors want returns, Big Oil will likely \"gobble up\" the smaller guys in the U.S. shale patch over the next five years, and companies like Exxon and Chevron will become even bigger, Papa told Reuters.Analysts expect bankruptcies in the shale industry to increase this year, while mergers and acquisitions are also set to rise as a growing number of distressed U.S. oil and gas firms and few funding options could mean that the 'smaller guys' could be acquired by bigger players or the smaller guys could team up to scale operations and cut costs.

At the same time, ADNOC will make sure that there is some amount of crude oil left at the Japanese facilities in case of oil shortage or emergency.The new three-year deal \"positively contributes to Japanese energy security, while also supporting Adnoc's broader trading ambitions,\" Dr Sultan Al Jaber, UAE Minister of State and ADNOC Group's chief executive said in a statement, as carried by The National.Around a quarter of Japan's crude oil imports come from the UAE, while 90 percent of Japanese oil demand is met with imports from the Middle Eastern region, according to Reuters estimates.For resource-poor Japan, the deal is part of boosting its energy security, while ADNOC gets access to more storage and trading opportunities in the world's fastest-growing oil demand market, Asia.Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation (JOGMEC) renewed last month the crude oil tank lease agreement with Saudi Aramco. The Saudi Arabian state oil giant will be able to store crude oil in the next three years at a facility in Okinawa, while Japan will receive preferentially the crude in case of emergency.In 2018, ADNOC announced its intention to expand downstreamoperations in and outside the UAE, \"to take full advantage of the rising demand for higher value refined and petrochemical products, particularly in the growth economies of China and Asia.\"By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Energy transitions \"take decades, even centuries\" to complete, the chairman of the world's largest oil company, Saudi Aramco, said at a conference on Monday, adding that the industry should continue to think in decades.  Because complete energy transformations take such a long time to complete, the oil industry should continue to think in decades, Aramco's chairman Yasir Al-Rumayyan said at the International Petroleum Technology Conference (IPTC) in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, as carried by Al Arabiya English.  Al-Rumayyan's remarks are the latest from the world's biggest oil firm and the world's most valuable company that the world will still need oil decades from now and that peak oil demand is just 'hype.'Analysts and top commodity traders see oil demand peaking at some point in the 2030s, but oil companies say that peak oil is nowhere in sight and there is still room to grow as global energy demand will continue to rise in the foreseeable future.The oil industry, and especially Saudi Aramco, still sees itself as being relevant for decades to come, because the world will still need a lot of oil, because huge investments in new production will be needed just to replenish maturing oil fields, and because the road transportation sector is not the primary source of demand for oil.Last year, Amin Nasser, the chief executive of Saudi Aramco, rebuked all those who predict the demise of the oil industry in the near future, saying that views that the world will soon run on anything but oil \"are not based on logic and facts, and are formed mostly in response to pressure and hype.\"At the Oil and Money Conference in London in October 2019, Nasser talked about climate change and emissions, but noted in his speech that both new energy sources and existing sources of energy would contribute to the global energy mix in the foreseeable future.\"Without a doubt, oil and gas will be here for many decades to come,\" Nasser said, and added: \"But there can also be no question that climate change is among the most significant challenges facing humanity.\" By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "London-listed oil producer Lekoil has suspended trade in its shares amid a budding scandal involving a loan from a company claiming to act on behalf of the Qatar sovereign investment fund.Alliance News reports Lekoil had agreed a $184-million loan with representatives of the Qatar Investment Authority earlier this month, to be used for the development of an offshore field, Ogo, in Nigeria.The funding, according to Energy Voice, was to go towards the drilling of two exploratory wells during the second half of this year. Lekoil is currently surveying the area.More than a week after Lekoil entered the loan agreement, other representatives of the Qatari sovereign wealth fund approached the company to express suspicions about the validity of the loan. Ultimately, it was established the Qatari Investment Authority had no knowledge of any loans with Lekoil.\"Lekoil is urgently seeking to establish, alongside its legal counsel and nominated adviser, the full facts of this matter, and pending this clarification, the company has requested that its ordinary shares be suspended from trading on AIM with immediate effect,\" the company said this week.The Financial Times meanwhile reported that the loan agreement had involved an intermediary: a Bahamas-based company called Seawave Invest. Seawave Invest connected Lekoil with people who claimed they were representatives of the QIA but, according to Lekoil, had \"constructed a complex facade in order to masquerade as representatives\" of the fund. The company added it had paid $600,000 to Seawave Invest.The FT recalls this is not the first time a Nigerian-focused oil company has had trouble. In 2018, Lekoil's partner in the Ogo field was found guilty of money laundering and fraud, for example. Lekoil bought off Afren and currently has 40 percent in the field. However, the company is looking to sell on the 22.86 percent it bought from Afren. The operator and majority shareholder in the field is Nigerian Optimum.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

The alert added that local residents did not need to take any protective action.\"There has been NO abnormal release of radioactivity from the station and emergency staff are responding to the situation. People near the Pickering Nuclear Generating Station DO NOT need to take any protective actions at this time,\" the original alert read.Soon enough it became clear there had been no incident at all. Ontario Power Generation first tweeted that the alert had been sent in error, and then issued an official statement.\"OPG has a sophisticated and robust notification process in place that we would immediately follow in the unlikely event of an incident at the station. I want to assure the public that there was no incident at the station, and the plant is operating as designed,\" the utility's Chief Nuclear Officer said in the statement.The Ontario government admitted it had made a mistake in sending out the alert. The Solicitor General of the province, Sylvia Jones, said she had ordered a full investigation into the incident.Meanwhile, CBC released an overview of how Ontario would react in a real emergency situation involving a nuclear incident. The procedure involves PG informing all governments within 15 minutes of the incident and passing the buck to Emergency Management Ontario, which would apply the Provincial Nuclear Emergency Response Plan.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

Indeed, climate change is almost invariably the top issue that clients around the world raise with BlackRock,\" the asset manager's chairman and CEO Larry Fink said in a letter to CEOs.\"In the near future - and sooner than most anticipate - there will be a significant reallocation of capital,\" Fink said.Yet, BlackRock's passive index-tracking funds cannot divest shares of companies that are found to not have met the new standards, Bloomberg Opinion columnist Mark Gilbert says.Some asset managers, including BlackRock, continue to draw criticism from climate activists for their lack of support for climate resolutions and for siding with the oil and gas industry.Related: SUVs Not EVs: The Electric Car Boom Hits A SnagA recent report from non-profit organization Majority Action found that BlackRock backed just five out of 41 climate-critical resolutions at shareholders' meetings in 2019.BlackRock and Vanguard were called out in the report because \"they were also more likely to support management at these fossil fuel intensive companies than they did across U.S. equities overall.\"Extinction Rebellion was quick to comment on BlackRock's announcement that it would put sustainability at the center of its investment strategy.\"BlackRock remains waist-deep in fossil fuel investments and the world's top backer of companies that destroy the Amazon rainforest and ignore the rights of indigenous people.

        "content": "Venezuela's state-owned oil firm PDVSA is moving to market its crude oil overseas by enlisting its joint venture partners, including U.S. supermajor Chevron, to sell cargoes to buyers in Asia and Africa, Reuters reported on Monday, quoting PDVSA documents and sources at the joint ventures.Even with the U.S. sanctions on its oil, PDVSA's partners in the various joint ventures could market cargoes not breaching those sanctions, if the oil revenues are used to repay debts of those joint ventures, sources told Reuters.  The U.S. sanctions on Venezuela's oil exports essentially ban U.S. imports of oil from Venezuela, and the Latin American country saw its total exports slump in 2019.   Russia's Rosneft has emerged as the biggest trader of Venezuela's crude oil, as it helps PDVSA sell its oil and arrange the financing.But now, PDVSA is trying out the new method to sell its oil by allocating cargoes to joint venture partners in its projects in Venezuela, according to Reuters' sources and shipping documents it has reviewed.Chevron is a partner of PDVSA in the Petropiar and has a license to operate in Venezuela until January 22. The U.S. Treasury has renewed Chevron's three-month licenses to continue operating in Venezuela several times.Chevron has lifted three cargoes so far, two in Q4 2019 and one in January, according to Reuters' sources and the PDVSA documents it has seen.Referring to the oil cargo sales, Chevron spokesman Ray Fohr told Reuters:\"Proceeds from these marketing activities are paid to our joint venture accounts to cover the cost of maintenance operations, in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.\"Meanwhile, Venezuela has managed to gradually increase its crude oil production in recent months.According to the latest Reuters survey of OPEC's oil production, Venezuela managed to raise its output in December, which, if confirmed in OPEC's figures later this month, would mean that the country exempt from the OPEC+ cuts and under U.S. sanctions would have had a three-month streak of rising production.

        "content": "One of the most active companies on the Norwegian Continental Shelf, Lundin Petroleum, said on Monday that it had revised downwards its resource estimate for a recent discovery in the Barents Sea, and that it no longer considers that a stand-alone development would be commercial.Although Lundin Petroleum reported overall increased reserves and contingent resources as of December 31, 2019, its estimate for the Alta discovery in the Arctic waters of the Barents Sea \"has been adjusted downwards,\" based on the high specification 3D seismic survey and extensive data and analysis from the well drilled for the extended well test conducted in 2018.  Initially, Lundin had expected that the combined gross resource range for the Alta discovery and nearby Gohta discovery was at between 115 and 390 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMboe). As of September 2018, the development concept for Alta was a subsea field development connected to a standalone floating production and storage vessel.But now, Lundin is revising down its resource estimate, although it did not say by how much, and notes that \"a standalone development of the Alta and nearby Gohta discoveries is no longer considered to be commercial.\"The options for development now include a subsea tie-back development to either the Johan Castberg oilfield or another future host development in the area, Lundin said on Monday.Related: Canada Faces A New Oil Price ''Blowout''The decreased resource estimate is another blow to the hopes of the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD) that major discoveries in the Barents Sea could sustain Norway's oil and gas production into the next decades.The operators offshore Norway are exploring for oil and gas in both mature areas and in frontier regions in the Barents Sea in the hopes of finding the next giant Johan Sverdrup, which started pumping oil in early October 2019.Johan Sverdrup will boost Norwegian oil production through the mid-2020s, but the country will need more and larger oil discoveries soon in order to stave off another drop after the mid-2020s.According to NPD, 48 percent of resources in the North Sea, the Norwegian Sea, and the Barents Sea have been produced. In its annual report for 2019 last week, NPD lowered expectations for the Barents Sea Southeast due to dry wells, but lifted expectations for undiscovered resources in the central parts of the Barents Sea, due to the mapping of several prospects and good work in production licenses.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

The introduction of Birmingham's Clean Air Zone will reinforce our commitment to establish a zero emissions city,\" said Councillor Waseem Zaffar, Cabinet Member for Transport and Environment.The city's draft plan is subject to approval by the UK cabinet later in January and is set to go out to public consultation from January 28 onwards. Birmingham is the latest city in the UK aiming to limit the use of private vehicles in a bid to reduce emissions and air pollution.Last week, for example, Oxford City Council and Oxfordshire County Council published final draft proposals for the UK's first city centre Zero Emission Zone (ZEZ), which is set to be established later in 2020.Related: China's Oil Demand Growth Could Halve This Year\"The ZEZ aims to reduce Oxford's toxic air pollution levels, tackle the climate emergency, and improve the health of those living, working, and visiting in Oxford and beyond,\" the Oxford City Council said.Sadiq Khan, the mayor of the UK's capital and largest city, London, also has ambitious plans to limit the use of private cars.In 2017 the mayors of 12 big cities worldwide--including London, Paris, Los Angeles, Copenhagen, Barcelona, Quito, Vancouver, Mexico City, Milan, Seattle, Auckland, and Cape Town--pledged to procure only zero-emission buses from 2025 and ensure that a major area of their city is zero emission by 2030.\"I want to make London one of the greenest cities in the world - that's why I'm putting walking, cycling and zero emission public transport right at the heart of Londoners' day-to-day lives alongside energy efficient buildings, clean energy and increased recycling,\" Khan said in 2017.

Wind will be the main source of new capacity additions, followed by solar and natural gas, according to EIA's latest inventory of electric generators. New wind capacity additions will account for 44 percent of all U.S. electric capacity additions in 2020. Solar power will account for 32 percent of additions and natural gas additions will represent 22 percent of all new U.S. capacity. The remaining 2 percent will come from hydroelectric generators and battery storage, EIA's estimates show.Due to the expiration of the U.S. production tax credit (PTC) at end-2020, wind power developers are rushing to install more wind capacity this year before the tax credit expires. The phase-out of the tax credit extension also pushed up wind power installations last year, which the EIA estimates at 11.8 gigawatts (GW).  This year, new wind power capacity of 18.5 GW is set to come online, setting a record as it will beat the previous record of 13.2 GW new wind capacity set in 2012.In solar power, the new additions are also set to break the previous record, as 13.5 GW of solar capacity is expected to come online this year, easily beating the previous record addition of 8 GW in 2016. More than half of the utility-scale electric power sector solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity additions will be in four states--Texas, California, Florida, and South Carolina.  Most of the natural gas additions--more than 70 percent--will be in Pennsylvania, Texas, California, and Louisiana.  Coal will lead the capacity retirements this year, as it did last year, when for one month, April, renewables held a larger share than coal in U.S. monthly electricity generation, for the first time ever.  In 2020, a total of 51 percent of scheduled capacity retirements will be coal-fired, followed by natural gas with 33 percent and nuclear with 14 percent, EIA's data shows.

Refineries have been disrupted due to the cold, and barrels that can't be shipped via pipeline due to capacity constraints must be shipped by rail--and trains move slower in the cold as well, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday.The price of a barrel of WCS has fallen to $35.33 as of Tuesday, from $40.77 just ten days ago. While some of the fall is in line with other oil prices that have fallen this week on geopolitical tensions easing and persistent worry that the China/US trade deal may not boost oil demand growth as much as the market would like, the gap between WCS and WTI has widened, from $22.50 per barrel on January 6 to $22.90 on Tuesday.Already Canada has restricted production to shrink the gap between the two benchmarks, although it has eased some of these production restrictions as the gap between the two began to shrink last year.Most of Canada's oil exports make their way to the United States, with its heavy, sour crude finding a willing market in the US Gulf Coast refineries, which typically set the price of the WCS to WTI differential due to their strong buying power for the grade.If Canada's oil production does not fall in line with its falling ability to export its oil in the cold--where the cold and heavy oil must be mixed with extra condensate to keep it flowing--the gap between WTI and WCS will continue to widen.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

Uganda estimates that the fields would need US$5 billion for the drilling of \"over 500 wells\" and the construction of two central processing facilities and a water plant, he said.\"In Uganda, Joint Venture conversations with the Government are ongoing. Tullow remains committed to reducing its equity stake in the project ahead of FID,\" the company said in its trading update on Wednesday.In September 2019, reports had it that all activities on the oil pipeline planned to export crude from Uganda had been suspended, following the collapse of a stake acquisition deal in the key Ugandan oil project.Related: What's Next For Oil? No One Seems To AgreeThe East-African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP) is planned to be a 1,443-kilometer-long (897 miles) pipeline worth US$3.5 billion and expected to transport oil from Uganda to the Tanga port in Tanzania.But Tullow Oil said at the end of August that its agreement to sell part of its stake in the Lake Albert project to Total and CNOOC had been terminated because \"the Ugandan Revenue Authority and the Joint Venture Partners could not agree on the availability of tax relief for the consideration to be paid by Total and CNOOC as buyers.\"  Tullow warned then that this setback would likely delay the final investment decision on the Uganda pipeline project, initially expected for 2019.

Over the past few months, after the mid-September attacks on Saudi oil infrastructure, OPEC's biggest producer has directly reported to OPEC significantly different production numbers than OPEC's secondary source figures.In the aftermath of the attacks on its oil, Saudi Arabia was busy reassuring the oil market and its customers that it can and will quickly ramp up production to pre-attack levels and will leave no customer wanting for Saudi crude.For October, for example, Saudi Arabia's direct communication to OPEC showed production at 10.303 million bpd, while OPEC's secondary sources pinned the Saudi production at 10.0 million bpd.Later on, Saudi Arabia reported to OPEC that its November production had dropped by 412,000 bpd to 9.89 million bpd. The secondary sources estimated nearly the same production for November--9.85 million bpd, but this was 151,000 bpd lower than the October production as per the secondary sources.For December, OPEC's secondary sources found that Saudi Arabia's oil production was 9.762 million bpd, down by 111,000 bpd from November. The Saudis themselves reported production of 9.594 million bpd--this is a 168,000 bpd gap between the Saudi claim of production and the number from the secondary sources.Regardless of the source of reporting of production, Saudi Arabia was still the OPEC producer that cut its oil production in December the most, signaling that as OPEC's de facto leader, it is eager to show that it will continue to overcomply, by a mile, with its share of the cuts.As per secondary sources, Saudi Arabia's December cut of 111,000 bpd, as well as production reductions in Iraq and the UAE and an outage in Libya, more than offset Angola's 125,000-bpd production increase as the Girassol grade returned from maintenance.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "The Trump administration, which vowed to roll back Obama-era fuel economy standards to make cars more affordable might stop short of freezing these at 2020 levels, AP's Tom Krisher reports, citing a statement by the National Highway Traffic Safety Authority.The NHTSA and the Environmental Protection Agency yesterday submitted their final rules on greenhouse gas emissions and fuel economy to the White House Office of Management and Budget. Details of these were not disclosed but the NHTSA issued a statement that said, among other things, that the new rules will reduce emissions from new vehicles while making them more affordable for everyone.\"When finalized, this rule will be a win for all Americans,\" the statement also said.Last year, the administration proposed freezing fuel economy standards at the level that will be in effect this year rather than allowing them to continue to tighten as they were planned to do under the Obama legislation.The argument in favour of a freeze ran along the lines of making new cars more affordable--lower fuel economy standards would reduce the manufacturing costs for a car--and hence safer because newer cars are safer than older models and the more new cars people bought, the more safer cars they got.Not everyone agreed with this rationale for rolling back the fuel economy standards approved by the previous administration, including the EPA itself, whose Science Advisory Board wrote that \"There are significant weaknesses in the scientific analysis of the proposed rule.\"This disagreement notoriously pit the White House against California, which said it will seek to enforce its own fuel standards. Washington last year revoked the state's right to set its own exhaust gas standards and requirement for the increase of zero-emission cars, and California responded with the threat to sue once the new fuel economy standard rules were approved.One energy policy firm estimated the fuel economy standard freeze could end up costing $400 billion through 2050.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

The taxes and royalties paid in 2019 were up by 16 percent compared to the taxes the industry had paid in 2018, according to the association, which estimates that in 2019 the oil and gas industry contributed about US$44 million a day to state and local revenue.The Texas oil and gas industry has paid more than US$149 billion in state and local taxes and state royalties since 2007, when TXOGA first started collecting data.  The increase in taxes and royalties comes as the crude oil production in Texas jumped from 4.72 million bpd in October 2018 to 5.27 million bpd in October 2019, while natural gas production increased from 25 billion cubic feet per day in October 2018 to 29 billion cubic feet per day in October 2019, TXOGA's report shows.\"Record-breaking oil and natural gas production levels pushed production or \"severance\" tax revenues to new highs. Drilling and completion of new wells have also kept sales tax revenues high, and both increased production and new wells drilled have kept property tax revenues high,\" TXOGA said in the report.Related: Bad News For Oil: Refinery Profits Are SlidingThe report comes at a time when Texas producers are struggling with associated gas which they are forced to burn--burning money--because of shortage of takeaway pipeline capacity and low natural gas prices.  The gas flaring in the Permian has reached record levels, but the association says that oil and gas companies are committed to working on improving their emissions profiles.\"I think Texas oil and natural gas companies are committed to making climate progress,\" TXOGA's Staples said at a conference call, as carried by the Houston Chronicle.\"They're committed to a lower emissions future,\" Staples noted.

        "content": "As many as 90 percent of Encana shareholders voted in favor of the company's proposed renaming and move to the United States as the company seeks to improve its access to more investment capital in index funds and passively managed funds, Encana said.The new name of the oil company will be Ovintiv and its headquarter will be in Denver, Colorado.\"We are extremely pleased with the vote of confidence from our shareholders today. With 90% of our securityholders voting \"FOR\" the resolution, there is clearly support for our efforts to expose Ovintiv to the deeper pools of capital in the U.S.--capturing the value we know exists within our equity,\" chief executive Doug Suttles said in the company statement. \"We will continue to focus on innovation and efficiencies throughout our operations, delivering the financial and operational performance our shareholders expect.\"According to the company, the move will not have any impact on day-to-day operations in Canada, where Encana/Ovintiv has an extensive presence in the Montney shale patch. Most of the company's assets, however, are in the U.S., spread across the shale patch.Encana has been expanding this presence, too. In 2018, it struck a $5.5-billion deal to acquire Newfield Exploration, which catapulted it to the ranks of the largest shale operators in the country.While the shareholder support for the move to the south was understandably welcome by the management, it also speaks volumes about the investment environment in Encana/Ovintiv's home country. This environment has drawn a lot of criticism from the industry as tight energy sector regulation and bleak growth prospects combine to discourage investors from staying in Canadian oil.However, the majority of Encana's shareholders--over two-thirds--are in the United Stats anyway, according to Bloomberg data, so it makes sense for the company to go where its shareholders are, despite criticism that the move won't solve all of its problems.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "The American Petroleum Institute (API) has estimated surprise crude oil inventory build of 1.1 million barrels for the week ending January 10, compared to analyst expectations of a 474,000-barrel draw in inventory.Last week saw a large draw in crude oil inventories of 5.95 million barrels, according to API data. The EIA's estimates, however, were of a build of 1.2 million barrels for that week.Oil prices were up earlier in the day prior to the afternoon data release, but were down significantly week on week after the initial shock wore off from the US airstrikes in Iraq that killed an Iranian military general Qassem Soleimani and corresponding retaliatory actions by Iran.At 3:34 pm EST, the WTI benchmark was trading up $0.25 (+0.43%) at $58.33--roughly $4 per barrel below last week's inflated levels. The price of a Brent barrel was also trading up on Tuesday, by $0.40 (+0.62%), at $64.60--also nearly $4 under last week's prices.The API this week also reported another build of 3.2 million barrels of gasoline for week ending January 10, after last week's large 6.7-million-barrel build. This week's large gasoline build compares to analyst expectations of a 3.386-million barrel-build for the week.Distillates, too, saw inventories increase by 6.8 million barrels for the week, adding onto last week's 6.40 million barrel build, while Cushing inventories saw no change.US crude oil production as estimated by the Energy Information Administration showed that production for the week ending January 3 stayed for the third week in a row at 12.9 million bpd, a record high for the United States. At 4:44 pm EDT, WTI was trading at $58.43, while Brent was trading at $64.64.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

This means that the industry believes in future value creation on the Norwegian continental shelf,\" Norway's Minister of Petroleum and Energy Sylvi Listhaug said in a statement.A total of 33 oil companies had applied for licenses in Norway's 2019 licensing round for exploration and development in the most mature areas of the shelf by the deadline.Today, Norway awarded 33 licenses in the North Sea, 23 licenses in the Norwegian Sea, and 13 licenses in the Barents Sea.The total number of awarded licenses this year is lower than the record-breaking 83 licenses awarded in last year's round in the mature areas.In this year's awards, as many as 28 different oil companies, ranging from the large international majors to smaller domestic exploration companies, were offered ownership interests in one or more production licenses, the ministry said.The companies that won licenses and/or operatorships include Equinor, Aker BP, Shell, ConocoPhillips, Lundin, Suncor, Total, Var Energi, and Wintershall Dea.\"Hopefully, the exploration in the awarded acreage will result in new discoveries. This is important to ensure employment, value-creation and future government revenue for Norway's largest industry,\" minister Listhaug said.  Norway's oil production is expected to jump in 2020 through 2023, thanks to the start up of Johan Sverdrup, which began pumping oil in early October 2019. But after Johan Sverdrup and after Johan Castberg in the Barents Sea scheduled for first oil in 2022, Norway doesn't have major oil discoveries and projects to sustain its oil production after the middle of the 2020s.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "title": "South Korea To Boost US Oil Imports In 2020",
        "content": "As South Korea is looking to reduce its over-reliance on crude oil imports from the Middle East, it has increased its oil imports from the United States in recent years, which mitigates, to an extent, Korea's exposure to a potential disruption of oil flows through the Strait of Hormuz, IHS Markit said on Thursday.   South Korea's diversification from oil supplies from the Middle East intensified as the U.S. slapped sanctions on Iranian oil exports and South Korea stopped importing oil from Iran.  Meanwhile, after the U.S. lifted a ban on oil exports at the end of 2015, American oil has started flowing to destinations in Asia.South Korea's plan to diversify its oil supplies and to reduce its reliance on the oil flows in the Strait of Hormuz has started to take shape faster than previously expected, Fotios Katsoulas, Liquid Bulk Principal Analyst, Maritime & Trade, IHS Markit, said in an analysis.Yet, South Korea has a long way to go to diversify and any disruption in the Strait of Hormuz will have the Asian oil importer struggling, Katsoulas noted.The Strait of Hormuz is the most important oil chokepoint in the world with daily oil flows averaging 21 million bpd, or the equivalent of 21 percent of global petroleum liquids consumption. According to EIA estimates, 76 percent of the crude oil and condensate that moved through the Strait of Hormuz in 2018 went to Asian markets, with China, India, Japan, South Korea, and Singapore the top destinations.Just three years ago, South Korea imported 74 percent of its crude oil from the Middle East. In 2018, this share dropped to 68 percent and then further down to 64 percent in 2019, according to IHS Markit data.Last year, South Korea was Asia's major importer of crude oil from the U.S.This year the trend is set to continue, unless the U.S.-Asia route becomes uneconomical, due to rising freight rates after the U.S. sanctioned Chinese shipping firms for knowingly dealing with Iranian oil, IHS Markit's Katsoulas says.

        "content": "France has deployed a radar system on Saudi Arabia's eastern coast that faces the Persian Gulf to help the Kingdom protect its vital oil infrastructure, which was hit by attacks in September, Reuters reported on Friday, quoting senior French officials.After the mid-September attacks on Saudi oil facilities, which cut off more than 5 percent of daily global oil supply for weeks, France--which like the U.S. pointed the finger at Iran as the ultimate perpetrator of the attacks--pledged to help Saudi Arabia to protect its oil infrastructure and prevent new attacks.\"In the Arabian Peninsula and Arab-Persian Gulf, where tensions are mounting, we have deployed in record time the Jaguar Task Force, which contributes to reassuring the Saudi kingdom,\" Reuters quoted French President Emmanuel Macron as saying in a speech to the French military on Thursday.Through initiatives with our European partners, we are bolstering the maritime security in the region that is of strategic importance to us, Macron said on Twitter.The radar system on the eastern Saudi coast is part of the Jaguar Task Force mission, French officials told Reuters, declining to provide additional information.Since the U.S. withdrew from the so-called Iran nuclear deal in May 2018, tensions between the U.S. and Iran have been rising. The U.S. is looking to cut off all of Iran's oil exports while Iran is accusing the United States of meddling with its affairs.The tensions escalated earlier this month, when the U.S. killed Iran's most powerful and visible military leader, Qassem Soleimani, at the Baghdad airport in Iraq.  Retaliation from Iran came several days later, when Tehran fired missiles at bases in Iraq that host U.S. troops, sending oil prices up by 4 percent for a few hours.On Friday, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said that Iran's missile strikes on U.S. bases in Iraq last week were a \"slap on the face\" to the United States.

        "content": "While U.S. crude oil production is set to continue to rise, energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in America are expected to have dropped last year and to continue falling through 2021, the Energy Information Administration said on Friday.   The declines in CO2 emissions last year and in the two coming years are driven by the less carbon intensive power generation across the U.S. where more efficient natural gas-fired plants are replacing coal-fired power plants, and by the rise of electricity generation from renewable energy sources, especially wind and solar power, the EIA said.In 2018, higher natural gas consumption due to extreme summer and winter weather and increased petroleum demand in transportation in a strong economy resulted in the United States reversing in that year several years of CO2 emissions reductions in the energy sector, the EIA said in November. The emissions increase in 2018 was the first such annual rise since 2014, EIA said.  But in 2019, the U.S. energy related CO2 emissions fell by 2.1 percent year on year, the EIA said today. Energy-related CO2 emissions are expected to continue their annual declines into 2020 and 2021, with a drop by 2.0 percent this year and a fall of 1.5 percent next year.\"If this forecast holds, energy-related CO2 emissions will have declined in 7 of the 10 years from 2012 to 2021,\" the EIA said. While energy-related CO2 emissions are set to decline through 2021, U.S. crude oil production is expected to continue to grow, albeit at a slower pace than before, the EIA said in its latest Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO) this week.In the January 2020 outlook, the EIA estimates that U.S. crude oil production averaged 12.2 million bpd last year, a rise by 1.3 million bpd compared to 2018. This year, EIA sees U.S. crude oil production averaging 13.3 million bpd, while the average American crude oil production will be 13.7 million bpd in 2021, with the Permian accounting for most of the growth.

        "content": "A Japanese high court has ordered local utility Shikoku Electric Power Company to continue idling its only operational nuclear reactor until the company provides a satisfactory proof that the reactor is safe.The extended shutdown of the nuclear reactor would lead to higher fuel costs for the Japanese utility.Shikoku Electric Power's only operational reactor at the Ikata nuclear plant in western Japan was taken offline at the end of December for regular maintenance. The utility planned to restart the reactor within two months, but the Hiroshima High Court has just ruled that the utility had not provided sufficient guarantees that the reactor would be safe in case of earthquakes or volcano eruptions.Shikoku Electric Power will appeal the high court's ruling, the company said on Friday, as carried by Reuters. Because of the extended nuclear reactor shutdown, the utility's costs on fuel would increase by US$33 million (3.5 billion Japanese yen) per month, according to Keiichiro Inoue, general manager at Shikoku Electric Power's branch office in Tokyo.Japan is taking nuclear safety extremely seriously after the Fukushima disaster in March 2011 and public perception of how safe nuclear energy is has markedly shifted negative since then.Resource poor Japan is the world's biggest LNG importer and among the top four coal and oil importers. Before the Fukushima disaster, Japan used to generate 27 percent of its power from nuclear reactors.Following the accident, Japan shut down all its 54 nuclear reactors to reassess their safety, and has restarted only a few of them so far.Public opposition to nuclear energy is creating uncertainty about how much nuclear generation capacity Japan will restore.Japan spent an additional annual average of around US$30 billion for fossil fuel imports in the three years after the Fukushima accident, according to EIA estimates.The country is also looking at alternative energy sources, including hydrogen, in order to reduce its fossil fuels import bill as the future of many of its nuclear reactors is still uncertain.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "title": "Angola Set To Finally Boost Its Oil Production",
        "content": "After years of declines in crude oil production, one of OPEC's largest African producers, Angola, is finally about to see its production rising in the coming years, with several new projects coming online.Italy's oil and gas major Eni said on Friday that it had started up the Agogo oilfield just nine months after its discovery, with the project timeline facilitated by the nearby Floating Production Storage Offloading (FPSO) Ngoma, which lies just 15 kilometers (9 miles) away from the Agogo field.The Agogo field is estimated to have more than 650 million barrels of oil in place, the Italian major said. Production at the new oilfield has already reached 10,000 barrels of oil per day (bpd) and is expected to rise to 20,000 bpd over the next few weeks, Eni said.  Another major European company, France's Total, has also been very active in Angola in recent months.In April last year, Total started up production at the Kaombo Sul oil development, adding 115,000 bpd to bring Total's overall production capacity to 230,000 bpd, equivalent to 15 percent of Angola's output.Total is also preparing to drill an ultra deepwater well off the coast of Angola that will be the deepest well in the world.The pick-up of drilling activity offshore Angola is welcome news for the OPEC producer which has suffered a steady production decline after the oil price crash of 2014 because older fields were maturing while prohibitive costs offshore Angola drove upstream investment away.Currently, Angola pumps around 1.4 million bpd, according to OPEC's latest Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR), which showed the country boosted its production by the most among OPEC producers in December after the Girassol grade returned from maintenance. OPEC's overall production dropped as additional cuts from Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and the UAE more than offset Angola's 125,000-bpd monthly production rise in December.

        "content": "A dense fog in the area of the Sabine Pass LNG facility in Louisiana has suffered reduced supplies of natural gas and limited tanker movement, S&P Global Platts reports, adding that the problem could continue throughout the weekend.The disruption comes amid subdued demand for LNG from Asia combined with increased supply. However, Cheniere Energy this week reaped the benefits of the Phase 1 trade deal between the United States and China, with its shares rising considerably on news that China may buy more than $50 billion worth of additional U.S. energy products, including LNG.A day earlier, S&P Global Platts reported that natural gas flows into liquefaction trains across the six operating LNG facilities in the United States had shot up to 8.5 billion cu ft in December. This was a record-high amount and represented almost a tenth of the total natural gas production in the country.New LNG capacity additions were strong last year, providing a much-needed export venue from growing U.S. gas production that pushed prices to historic lows, including several occasions on which they traded below zero. This year, S&P Global Platts analysts expect the addition of new capacity to continue but at a slower pace as competition intensified internationally.Cheniere Energy is by far the largest U.S. producer and exporter of liquefied natural gas and its Sabine Pass plant is the oldest and largest one, with five liquefaction trains in operation and a sixth one under construction. Cheniere also operates a smaller plant in Corpus Christi in Texas. This one has two liquefaction trains in operation and a third one under construction.Cheniere booked a 53-percent annual increase in LNG exports during the first nine months of 2019, with the increase in exports during the third quarter alone at 68 percent on a year earlier. However, the company also swung into a loss during the period from a net profit in January-September 2018.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Canada's Supreme Court has dismissed an appeal by British Columbia that aimed to stop work on the controversial Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project, Bloomberg reports, adding that the decision to dismiss the case was unanimous.\"We are all of the view to dismiss the appeal for the unanimous reasons of the Court of Appeal for British Columbia,\" the Chief Justice of Canada said after the presentation of arguments.British Columbia's government is a staunch opponent of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion on the grounds that it will increase the risk of spills and leaks both along its route and in the waters around the port of Burnaby where the pipeline is supposed to load oil onto tankers bound for export markets. To prevent the expansion from taking place, the government decided to claim a right to dictate how much oil and gas pass through the territory of the province.It first took its case to the British Columbia Court of Appeals but the court rejected the case saying that the province did not have jurisdiction over the amount of oil that can pass through its territory.Later last year the B.C. court told the government it should reconsider its stance on the project, which is the only pipeline project that has received the approval of the federal Canadian government. B.C. then took its case to the Supreme Court.Trouble is not over for the pipeline expansion project, however. Last month, a group of First Nations filed an appeal against the project at the very same Federal Court of Appeal. The group had argued the federal government had failed to consult them on the project properly. The consultation the government did hold, according to the First Nations, was little more than \"window-dressing, box-ticking and nice-sounding words.\"The Trans Mountain expansion project, which Ottawa bought from Kinder Morgan when the company got tired of delays and uncertainty and quit, will increase the capacity of the current pipeline three times to 890,000 bpd and aims to stimulate Canadian oil exports to destinations different from the United States. It will also provide a much-needed outlet for growing oil production in Alberta.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilpricer.com:"

India has already boosted its imports of U.S. crude oil after the United States ended the waivers for Iranian oil customers when it stepped up the sanctions pressure on Iran's regime last year.India was until recently Iran's second-largest oil customer after China, but the U.S. sanctions on Iranian oil exports made India stop purchases of oil from Iran as refiners did not want to risk secondary U.S. sanctions if they continue doing business with Tehran.Earlier this month, three officials with direct knowledge of the matter told Hindustan Times that India plans to double the volume of its oil imports from the U.S. as it looks to reduce its over-reliance on imports from the Middle East.Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) were India's largest oil suppliers in the 2018-2019 fiscal year, while Kuwait is also a big supplier of oil to India.\"We are in talks with the US government and private oil firms as petroleum is an unregulated business in that country. We expect good rates and better terms from American firms that would compensate for our transportation costs. In return, we can offer them an assured market,\" one of the officials told Hindustan Times.India, which relies on imports for more than 80 percent of its oil demand, will see its oil consumption grow at the fastest pace than any major economy in the world by 2040, as the country is becoming increasingly influential in global energy markets, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said last week.

        "content": "Over the past six months, the number of drilled but uncompleted (DUC) wells across the U.S. shale patch has been steadily declining in a fresh sign that shale producers have stopped the relentless drilling of wells.The slowdown in drilling is expected to weigh on the fourth-quarter results of the world's major oilfield services companies working on well completions in the key U.S. shale regions, Bloomberg reports, citing analyst forecasts.The number of DUC wells in the seven key shale regions dropped to 7,574 in November, down by 131 from the October DUC well inventory of 7,705, according to the latest data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).According to Bloomberg estimates based on EIA data, the number of DUC wells dropped from a recent high of 8,429 in May 2019 to 7,574 such wells in November. This drop in just six months was the steepest fall in DUC wells numbers for the past three years, Bloomberg has estimated.Analysts now expect the largest oilfield services providers to report in their Q4 earnings later this month continued decline in fracking and completions activity. This would be yet another sign that U.S. oil producers have slowed drilling as investors want returns from the U.S. shale patch, not crude oil oversupply.Halliburton is expected to report a fall of 29 percent in its earnings in Q4, according to analysts who spoke to Bloomberg. Baker Hughes, which spun off its fracking services business, on the other hand, is seen reporting higher earnings.The slowdown in U.S. drilling and completions services is expected to be in sharp contrast to recovering international and offshore oilfield services segments.The world's biggest oilfield services provider, Schlumberger, started flagging last year the evident slowdown in North America's drilling growth. For Q3, Schlumberger said that international activity and its greater exposure to drilling outside U.S. shale drove its revenues higher, while North American revenues declined.

        "content": "Supply of shipping fuels compliant with the stricter, low-sulfur, regulations are growing at a fast pace and are at adequate levels at the key hubs around the world, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Thursday.According to the new rules by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), only 0.5-percent or lower sulfur fuel oil should be used on ships beginning January 1, 2020, unless said ships have installed the so-called scrubbers--systems that remove sulfur from exhaust gas emitted by bunkers--so they can continue to use high-sulfur fuel oil (HSFO).In previous months, refiners, traders, and buyers have been bracing for what was expected to be \"the single largest oil market disruptor\" and there were concerns that supply of low-sulfur fuels, especially very-low sulfur fuel oil (VLSFO), could not be enough.The IEA allayed those concerns today, saying that early data shows that supply is rising fast.\"We are starting to see the first data on the transition and, it appears that deliveries of the new VLSFO bunkers are increasing fast,\" the IEA said in its monthly Oil Market Report, as carried by Reuters.\"Although there are initial local difficulties as might be expected from such a complex global change, ship operators, products suppliers and ports have so far coped well,\" the Paris-based agency said in its report.\"As the new IMO rules are introduced, cracks for compliant VLSFO made large gains and HSFO in Singapore drew some support on demand from ships fitted with scrubbers,\" the IEA noted.Due to the new IMO rules, demand for heavy and sweet crude grades is high, as those are the most suited for processing into low-sulfur fuel for ships. Strong demand for heavy-sweet crude grades has resulted in a recent spot tender in which a crude from Australia sold for close to US$100 a barrel, making it what traders said was probably the most expensive crude in the world.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "The start-up of the massive Johan Sverdrup oilfield sent Norway's oil production rising to a nine-year high in December 2019, beating the authorities' forecast by 12.7 percent, data from the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD) showed on Friday.  In December 2019, the third month of operation of Equinor's Johan Sverdrup oilfield in the North Sea, Norway's oil production averaged 1.759 million barrels per day (bpd), the highest oil production offshore Norway since January 2011.Norway's oil production in December rose by 4.3 percent from November and jumped by 17 percent compared to December 2018.Despite the Johan Sverdrup start-up, the average oil production in Norway in full-2019 was expected to be at its lowest level in three decades, the NPD has estimated previously.But Johan Sverdrup's development will help Norway boost its oil production over next few years.The huge oilfield in Norway's North Sea is already producing 350,000 barrels of oil per day, two months after coming on stream, a senior executive at Equinor told Reuters early last month.Daily oil production during the first phase of the Johan Sverdrup development is estimated at 440,000 bpd and is expected to be reached by the middle of this year. Peak production with the second development phase is expected to reach 660,000 bpd. At peak production, Johan Sverdrup will account for around a third of Norway's crude oil production, operator Equinor says.Norway's oil production is expected to jump in 2020 through 2023, thanks to the start up of Johan Sverdrup, which began pumping oil in early October 2019. But after Johan Sverdrup and after Johan Castberg in the Barents Sea scheduled for first oil in 2022, Norway doesn't have major oil discoveries and projects to sustain its oil production after the middle of the 2020s.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) reported as many as 45,347 incidents of breaches on its oil pipelines between 2001 and mid-2019, the corporation's managing director Mele Kyari said on Tuesday, after an explosion believed to have been caused by oil thieves killed at least five people late on Sunday.NNPC and the other oil companies operating in Nigeria need to be able to operate efficiently so that Nigeria's economy can prosper, NNPC's head Kyari said, as carried by Nigerian media.\"Unfortunately, the combination of crude oil theft, illegal refining and pipeline vandalism, has become a major threat to Nigeria in meeting its revenue projections in recent time,\" Kyari noted.On Sunday, at least five people died and dozens of others were rushed to hospital after an oil pipeline exploded in Nigeria in a blast that the authorities believe was caused by oil thieves who ruptured the pipeline belonging to the NNPC.\"These insertions into the p/lines can never be done in isolation. There's a huge conspiracy of silence around this tragic situation. I mean conspiracy of silence from those who have the responsibility to protect the pipeline & those who watch this happen,\" Kyari said on Tuesday.\"We are counting on Nigerians to help us resolve this as it is becoming a matter of national security concern,\" he added.NNPC has often raised the alarm that oil pipeline vandalism in Nigeria is soaring. For example, the number of incidents of breached pipelines surged by 115 percent in July 2019 compared to June, NNPC said last year.Pipeline vandalism, as well as pipeline sabotages by militants in Nigeria's oil-rich Niger Delta area, has plagued Nigeria's oil production and exports for years. Over the past year and a half, militant activity has subsided, allowing Nigeria to boost its crude oil production, and also making Africa's largest oil producer a full-fledged participant in the production cuts of the OPEC+ coalition.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

However, this will not make South Korea part of a U.S.-led coalition for the Strait of Hormuz.South Korea used to be one of the top buyers of Iranian oil and chances are it doesn't want to damage its relations with Tehran beyond repair with a view to Washington eventually lifting the sanctions that snapped back on Iran after President Trump pulled out of the so-called Iran nuclear deal.The anti-piracy vessel has been deployed in the Gulf of Aden since 2009 with the main purpose of countering Somali piracy as part of an international initiative involving the European Union, the United States, and several African countries.The Cheonghae unit includes a destroyer, an anti-submarine helicopter, and three speed boats. It has a military force of 302.Concern about the safety of tanker traffic through the Strait of Hormuz spiked last year after Iran seized a British-flagged tanker there in response to the seizure of an Iranian tanker by the Gibraltar authorities with the help of the British Navy. The tanker seizure exchange was resolved later in the year but with heightened tensions between Iran and the United States that featured threats from Tehran that it will close the Strait of Hormuz and cripple oil exports from the Middle East, concern ran high.The U.S. and the UK were the most vocal proponents of a coalition to safeguard the passageway, but other countries remained reluctant about committing to such a coalition.The UK, however, sent two Royal Navy vessels to guard British-flagged tankers in the strait. The two were first deployed last year after the tanker seizure and now returned to the chokepoint.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

Other recent runaways, either in whole or in part, are Kinder Morgan, whose Canadian experience rose to nightmarish proportions, ConocoPhillips, Shell, Equinor, and Marathon Oil.The situation is so dire for the municipalities, according to the Financial Post, that some now have a \"write-down budget\", to account for taxes due from companies who are likely to never make good on their payments.Last year, the Alberta Court of Appeal ruled that municipalities are unsecured creditors when it comes to bankruptcy--this means that are last to get paid in the event of default--and less likely to see the money ever.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Saudi Arabia's economy is expected to grow by 1.9 percent this year, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said on Monday, revising down its forecast of 2.2-percent growth from just three months ago, due to expected lower Saudi oil production as the Kingdom has pledged to overcomply with the OPEC+ oil production cuts.In its January update of the World Economic Outlook (WEO) from October, the IMF cut on Monday its economic growth projections for the global economy and that in the Middle East and Central Asia region. Economic growth in the Middle East and Central Asia is now seen at 2.8 percent this year, down by 0.1 percentage point from the October estimate.In the October forecasts, the IMF had expected Saudi Arabia's real GDP growth to pick up to 2.2 percent in 2020, after sluggish 0.2 percent growth in 2019. Back then, the IMF said that Saudi Arabia would need oil prices at US$86.50 in 2019 and US$83.60 in 2020 in order to balance its budget.\"The downgrade for 2020 mostly reflects a downward revision to Saudi Arabia's projection on expected weaker oil output growth following the OPEC+ decision in December to extend supply cuts,\" the IMF said today.At the OPEC+ meeting in December, OPEC and its partners decided to deepen the current cuts by 500,000 bpd in the first quarter of 2020, when demand is expected at its weakest for 2020. This brings total production reductions at 1.7 million bpd--that is if rogue members fall in line with their quotas.Related: Oil Is The Only Way Back Up For VenezuelaConsidering the pledge from OPEC's largest producer and de facto leader Saudi Arabia that it would continue to significantly overcomply with its share of the cuts, the total OPEC+ cuts could be as high as 2.1 million bpd, OPEC said.Signs of tentative stabilization of global economic growth have started to emerge, but risks continue to be skewed to the downside, although not as adverse as in October, the IMF said in its January update and warned about disruptions to global oil supply.\"Rising geopolitical tensions, notably between the United States and Iran, could disrupt global oil supply, hurt sentiment, and weaken already tentative business investment,\" the IMF said.

        "content": "The world's newest oil frontier, Guyana, has officially shipped its very first batch of crude oil on Monday, according to TankerTrackers.com--a major oil-first for the South American country.The first batch of oil--a million barrels of Liza sweet crude oil--is currently on a Suezmax tanker Yannis P headed for the United States, Tanker Trackers said. The Liza field is co-owned by Hess Corp (NYSE: HES), China's CNOOC, and operator ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM)--who is the envy of all oil companies at the moment for 15 mouthwatering finds offshore Guyana.The project has uncovered more than 6 billion barrels of recoverable oil and gas, although a more recent find earlier this month will increase that figure.It is not yet known which of ExxonMobil's US refineries the new crude will end up in.All in all, ExxonMobil and its partners are expecting to produce at least 750,000 barrels per day within five years--a figure that if achieved would catapult Guyana into a serious global oil player.Guyana's most recent discovery courtesy of Exxon and Hess was from Mako-1, which is also in the Stabroek block.Exxon's quick success in Guyana has triggered an exploration campaign in neighboring Suriname, with a Total/Apache partnership striking oil right across the border just last week. The development brings hope to Suriname that it, too, could one day become an oil powerhouse.HES stock has jumped from $51.87 a year ago, to $69.90 today, while XOM is trading down from $71.89 a year ago to $68.56 today. Meanwhile, Apache is trading nearly flat year over year.Speaking of the landmark moment, Guyana's Acting Prime Minister Khemraj Ramjattan called ExxonMobil \"the bravest, the most technologically driven with a record of durability second to none in the industry.\"By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

Somalia hopes the new law and the revenue sharing framework will attract oil majors to exploring for oil in its waters.A possible joint exploration deal between Turkey and Somalia would come after an agreement between Turkey and Libya from late last year, which enraged Turkey's Mediterranean neighbors, Greece and Cyprus.  Turkey signed at the end of last year a maritime agreement with Libya's UN-recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) to set up an exclusive economic zone from Turkey's southern coast to Libya's northeast shores. The deal, also aimed at \"sharing resources\", drew harsh criticism from Greece and Cyprus who fear a resource grab from Turkey in the Mediterranean.Earlier this month, Erdogan said that Turkey and Libya could use the services of international companies for their joint oil and gas exploration plans in the Mediterranean.

The explosion is thought to be the result of illegal activities by the so-called pipeline vandals in Nigeria--thieves who frequently try to steal oil and petroleum products from pipelines by puncturing them.The initial explosion was followed by others, while the fires from the explosions have thrown the residents in the area into panic.NNPC's Group managing director, Mele Kyari, arrived on Monday for an on-the-spot assessment of the pipeline explosion, the Nigerian state oil corporation said on Twitter.\"It's unfortunate we lost 5 lives to this inferno, with many in critical condition in the hospitals, all due to unpatriotic acts of vandals along our Pipeline Right of Way, who make insertions into the pipelines to steal products, leading to disasters such as this,\" Kyari said.According to NNPC's head, the corporation is working on a daily basis with Nigeria's security agencies to try to curb the 'oil stealing' phenomenon.\"Nigerians must know that these acts of vandals are happening within communities and if they are allowed to continue, then they will eventually kill all of us!,\" Kyari said.NNPC raised the alarm last year that oil pipeline vandalism in Nigeria was soaring, with the number of incidents of breached pipelines surging by 115 percent in July compared to June.

Some, however, notably Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, argued that the presence of a U.S. company in Venezuela would help to quicken the recovery of its oil industry when--and if--the government changes.Chevron operates a joint venture with Venezuela's PDVSA in the country that is home to the world's most abundant oil resources. Petroboscan, the joint venture, produced around 200,000 bpd as of October, with Chevron's share of this at 34,000 bpd. The U.S. supermajor holds a 30-percent stake in the venture.Reuters noted that Chevron reported losses of $104 million related to its business in Venezuela for the first nine months of the year. Yet if the Treasury Department stops granting it sanction waivers, Chevron would have to leave the country, which would cost it $2.7 billion in assets.\"Chevron is a constructive presence in Venezuela, where we have been part of the local communities for nearly a century,\" a spokesman for the company told Reuters. \"We remain focused on our base business operations and supporting the more than 8,800 people who work with us and their families. Our operations continue in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.\"Besides Chevron, four oilfield services companies have been granted sanction waivers to continue doing business in Venezuela.

Another field is at risk of shutting down starting today as well.Al Ahdab is operated by China's CNPC, but it has been blockaded by security guards who are protesting against the absence of permanent employment contracts. The other field at risk of closure, Badra, produces about 50,000 bpd. Russia's Gazprom Neft is the operator of that field.Iraq is the second-largest oil producer and exporter in OPEC. It has been hit by a series of economic protests that started last year and are not showing any sings of ending any time soon as disgruntled citizens demand better public services and economic reforms and protest against widespread government corruption.Al Jazeera reports that on Sunday, protesters closed several large roads in cities around the capital Baghdad and demonstrated on the street in anticipation of the deadline they had set for the government to respond to their demands for a new Prime Minister and a new government. The demands were initially made by protesters in the city of Nasiriya, but others soon joined in, Al Jazeera's Gareth Browne reports.Oil prices trended higher early on Monday following the news of the escalation, supported also by news from Libya, where oil exports were suspended after forces loyal to General Khalifa Haftar blocked the export terminals in the Oil Crescent.The events in Iraq and Libya are lending quite an upside potential to prices in the immediate run. The Iraqi protests are particularly bullish for prices: field outages are something of a norm in Libya and traders have more or less gotten used to them.Serious supply disruptions from Iraq, on the other hand, have not happened recently, and therefore have the potential to push prices a lot higher.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "A growing number of oil companies will boost their investments in low-carbon projects this year as they focus on lowering their carbon footprint, a survey from Norwegian DNV GL has suggested. A trend that is largely being driven by pressure from investors.As much as 71 percent of respondents in the survey said they planned to either maintain their level of investment in low-carbon projects or increase it. This was up from 51 percent last year and comes despite the volatile oil price environment, the energy consultancy notes.More than half of the 1,000 respondents also said their company was actively adapting to a less carbon-intensive industry environment. That was up from just 44 percent in 2018.Unsurprisingly, with this new focus on cleaner energy production, fewer industry executives expect large-scale, expensive oil projects to be approved this year. Just 46 percent said they expected an increase in the number of approved capital-intensive projects, compared with as much as 67 percent in 2019.At the same time, it seems that many in the industry have adapted to the post-2014 world with oil prices lower for longer, the survey also found. In fact, 46 percent of respondents said their companies would continue to turn in a profit even if the average oil price this year slipped below $50 a barrel.Related: The Shipping Industry's $1 Trillion ProblemOptimism about growth, however, has not risen. The survey found that only 66 percent of industry executives expected growth in oil and gas this year, down from 76 percent in 2019. Two-thirds is still an impressive majority of optimists, but the decline from 2019 does suggest that some pessimism is creeping in, too.This is not least because of the increased emphasis on renewable energy and other climate change tackling tactics that have cast a shadow over the growth prospects of oil and gas, not just in the immediate term but in the long term as well. The energy industry's new focus on low-carbon projects is proof enough they are taking the renewable challenge seriously.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

According to Bloomberg's sources, there was agreement that the oil industry should include these so-called Scope 3 emissions, but Big Oil's chief executives didn't take any decisions at the Wednesday meeting closed to the press.In the oil industry, many companies have started to include emissions reporting and monitoring in recent years, but few have pledged to set targets for the products they sell.In December 2018, in an industry first, Shell said that it plans to set short-term targets for reducing the net carbon footprint of the energy products it sells, and to link those targets with executive remuneration. The world needs to get to the point at which it will no longer add to the stock of greenhouse gases, and reducing emissions to net zero \"is the only way to go,\" Shell's chief executive Ben van Beurden said this summer, calling on businesses to work together to move faster in addressing climate change.Related: Oil Diversification Is Already Bearing Fruit For Gulf EconomiesHowever, Shell's core business is and will continue to be oil and gas for the foreseeable future, van Beurden has said.The meeting in Davos comes just as the International Energy Agency (IEA) warned in a new report that Big Oil faces \"twin threats\" in the energy transition--losing profitability as well as social acceptability.\"The oil and gas industry is facing increasing demands to clarify the implications of energy transitions for their operations and business models, and to explain the contributions that they can make to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and to achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement,\" the IEA said in the report.

Novak, who has been leading the energy ministry since 2012, has been a key figure in the talks between OPEC and its leader and largest producer, Saudi Arabia, and the Russia-led alliance of non-OPEC producers in cutting deals to reduce oil production in recent years.A week ago, the Russian government, including Energy Minister Alexander Novak, resigned in an unexpected move after Putin said that he would be looking to make amendments to the Russian constitution. Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev tendered the resignation of his whole government last week to allow the president room to prepare for the discussion of the constitutional amendments, the outgoing prime minister said at a meeting of the cabinet with Putin.After a week of speculation and uncertainty about who will hold which posts, including that of the energy minister, Putin signed the executive order to appoint the new government. Several key ministers, including Novak and Finance Minister Anton Siluanov, will keep their posts.Novak was widely expected to keep his job as energy minister in the government reshuffle.\"Putin believes the OPEC+ deal is positive for the Russian economy and Novak can count on retaining his position in the Russian political system,\" said an analyst from the Russian National Energy Security Fund. \"As a minimum, he would remain Energy Minister,\" Igor Yushkov added, referring to Novak.This should give assurances to OPEC and the market that Putin's energy representative at the upcoming meeting of the OPEC+ coalition in March is the same familiar face.Russia's position regarding the fate of the deeper production cuts in place until the end of March will be much less familiar, as Novak is known for keeping it 'a secret' until the day of the meeting.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Saudi Arabia will use part of the money raised through Aramco's initial public offering to strengthen its defense capabilities, Saudi Finance Minister Mohammed al-Jadaan told Reuters in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos.The minister told Reuters the Kingdom was making an effort to defuse the tension between the United States and Iran, which spiked after the U.S. assassination of a top Iranian general, and led to a retaliation against military bases housing U.S. troops in Iraq.\"If you look at history, we in this region have managed to weather through worse geopolitical situations, including actual, real wars,\" Al-Jadaan said, adding \"We work with our military industry to develop our own military assets in the mid-term to deal with these risks, including investment by PIF,\" \"We in Saudi have to focus on the economy and reform ... We firmly believe the disputes can only be resolved by dialogue,\" the minister added.Dialogue, it seems, is not always enough, however. Last year, a Saudi oil field and a processing plant became the target of missile and drone attacks that the Yemeni Houthi rebels took responsibility for but the U.S. blamed on Iran. Earlier this month, investigators assigned by the UN to find the culprit concluded in a confidential report that the Houthis could not be responsible for the attacks.The drone and missile attacks caused a fire at the Abqaiq oil processing facility and a production outage at the Khurais field, taking 5.7 million bpd in daily production offline. This caused a temporary spike in oil prices as Aramco struggled to restore production as quickly as possible.Although higher prices would benefit Saudi Arabia, preventing further attacks would be wiser in view of the longer-term ambitions that Riyadh has for Aramco. The company listed at home in December but, Al-Jadaan told Bloomberg, an international listing is still on the table.Meanwhile, the proceeds from the local listing would go towards strengthening various industries.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "South America's largest oil producer, Brazil, will launch discussions on potentially joining OPEC in July, Brazilian Energy Minister Bento Albuquerque told Reuters on Wednesday.In July, Albuquerque is scheduled to visit Saudi Arabia, and on that occasion, Brazil could begin talks on becoming a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, the minister said.Even if talks are successful, Brazil is not expected to become a member of OPEC this year, Albuquerque told Reuters.  Currently, the South American oil producer is okay with the Brent Crude price at around US$64 a barrel as it is a \"fair\" price, the minister said.The idea that Brazil may join OPEC was first aired in October last year, when Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said that OPEC's top producer and de facto leader Saudi Arabia had informally asked Brazil to join the organization.   \"I personally would very much like Brazil to become a member of OPEC,\" Bolsonaro said at the Future Investment Initiative 2019 in Riyadh in October.The idea was met with resistance from the Brazilian industry because producers are concerned that once an OPEC member, Brazil may have to play along and comply with any organization-level production cuts just as its oil production is rising and set to continue to increase.Production in Brazil is rapidly growing thanks to start-ups of new offshore oil fields.OPEC itself estimates that Brazil will be the second-largest contributor to non-OPEC supply growth in 2020, after the United States. Brazil, like the United States, is not part of the OPEC+ coalition that currently restricts production hoping to draw down global oversupply.In November, Brazil's crude oil production topped 3 million barrels per day for the first time ever, the National Petroleum Agency reported, adding that total oil and gas production rose to 3.95 million barrels of oil equivalent daily - also a record-breaking figure.

The US cited a worsening humanitarian emergency in the country.The NOC responded favorably to the US calls for resuming oil production, but said that \"operations can only resume when illegal blockades are lifted. Blockading hurts Libyan people and inflicts severe damage to the country's economy. All responsible parties should lift blockades and respect rule of law.\"Libya's oil production, according to secondary sources provided in OPEC's Monthly Oil Market Report for January, was 1.139 million bpd as of December.Despite the significant loss of production, oil prices have failed to move up, and oil was trading down on Tuesday, with WTI trading down 0.55% at $58.26 per barrel and Brent trading down 1.03% at $64.53 per barrel.The NOC has also warned that the shutdown of associated gas production, which supplies power plants in Zuetina and North Benghazi, will result in power shortages, which will lead to load shedding in the east. Supplies to the Ubari power plant in the south has also been disrupted, and when existing supplies run out, this power plant will shut down as well.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "The U.S. Embassy in Libya said on Tuesday that the country's National Oil Corporation (NOC) should be allowed to immediately resume oil operations that were suspended over the weekend after groups loyal to General Khalifa Haftar blocked virtually all oil production and exports from the African oil producer.  \"We are deeply concerned that the suspension of National Oil Corporation (NOC) operations risks exacerbating the humanitarian emergency in Libya and inflicting further needless suffering on the Libyan people. NOC operations should resume immediately,\" the U.S. Embassy in Libya said, as the OPEC member's major oil export pipelines and ports remained blocked for a third day.  On Sunday, 800,000 bpd--more than half of Libya's oil production of around 1.4 million bpd--was taken offline after forces loyal to Haftar blocked the oil ports in eastern Libya which are under the control of Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA). The move came ahead of an international conference in Berlin between Haftar and the Government of National Accord (GNA), which is backed by the UN.After the calls for port blockades on Friday, Libya's NOC said in a statement, via its chairman Mustafa Sanalla:\"If the fields are shut, the production loss will be immediate. We have limited available storage at our main ports. If they are closed, we will need to reduce production immediately, and to shut down entirely when available storage is filled. That could be in as little as five days.\"On Saturday, NOC declared force majeure after LNA blockaded oil exports from the Brega, Ras Lanuf, Hariga, Zueitina, and Sidra ports in the east.Related: 800,000 Bpd Offline After Haftar Affiliates Halt ExportsHaftar's forces also blocked production at the El Feel and Sharara fields in southern Libya and the crude transportation from those fields to the Zawiya export terminal.Oil prices rose on Monday on the news that Libya's production is suspended, but prices dropped on Tuesday as the market appears confident that the current oversupply can absorb an outage in Libya.\"Market participants appear to fret less about supply disruptions in the Middle East or at least the risk of disruptions thanks to the impressive growth we have seen in US output over recent years,\" Warren Patterson, ING's Head of Commodities Strategy and Senior Commodities Strategist Wenyu Yao, said on Tuesday.

Kirkuk is estimated to hold some 9 billion barrels of recoverable oil remaining, according to BP.But after the contract expired at the end of last year, BP told Iraq that it was withdrawing its staff from the Kirkuk oilfield, Reuters' sources said.\"It's very obvious study results were not encouraging for BP to extend its operations,\" a senior source at the North Oil Company told Reuters, adding that the study results were underwhelming for the Iraqi company, too.  BP told Reuters that it had completed its service contract and delivered its recommendations to the Iraq company, declining to comment on personnel movements.The pullout would be another blow to Iraq's plans to increase production capacity and come as major oil corporations, such as Chevron, are pulling American staff out of Iraq amid the heightened tension between the United States and Iran in Iraq, and continued protests in OPEC's second-largest producers.Just this weekend, escalating protests in Iraq led to a halt in production at the Al Ahdab oil field, which pumps some 70,000 bpd, while another field was at risk of shutting down as well.

Major Iraqi power plants are dependent on Iranian natural gas supply, and Iraq imports electricity from Iran, as Baghdad's power generation is not enough to ensure domestic supply.  The U.S. has regularly extended the waivers for Iraq to continue buying natural gas and electricity from Iran, even after the U.S. slapped sanctions on Iran and continued to ramp up those sanctions over the past year.The waiver for the Iraqi bank handling the payments to Iran in Iraqi dinars expires next month. If the U.S. doesn't extend the waiver, the bank--Trade Bank of Iraq (TBI)--will stop processing payments, the head of the bank Faisal al-Haimus told AFP on Tuesday.\"If the waiver ended, of course TBI will not pay for any gas or deal with any Iranian entity over gas or electricity. Absolutely,\" the bank's executive told the agency.The bank cannot afford not to comply with all regulations, including U.S. sanctions on Iranian entities, he said.The U.S. sanctions typically work by cutting off access to the U.S. banking system of persons or entities that deal with sanctioned countries and businesses, as is the case with Iran.Iraq's energy sector may become collateral damage in the recent U.S.-Iran tensions which unfolded on Iraq's territory.U.S. President Donald Trump threatened sanctions on Iraq earlier this month, after Iraq's parliament called on the Iraqi government to expel foreign troops out of the country.If the U.S. follows through with the threat, it could block Iraq's access to a U.S.-based account, where Iraq deposits its oil revenues that make up 90 percent of the Iraqi budget.

        "content": "The OPEC+ deal has resulted in economic benefits for Russia which has seen its National Wealth Fund (NWF) double its financial reserves to US$124 billion in 2019, Kirill Dmitriev, chief executive at the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), told the TASS news agency on Wednesday.Russia's National Wealth Fund is a part of federal budget assets, primarily supporting the country's pension system.Russia has been leading the group of non-OPEC producers that joined forces with OPEC at the beginning of January 2017 to reduce their combined oil production in the hope of draining down the oil oversupply and raising oil prices.  Russia's budget has benefited from the higher oil prices over the last couple of years since the so-called OPEC+ production cuts entered into force, top Russian officials have said.  The NWF saw its reserves double from US$65 billion (4.04 trillion Russian rubles) to US$124.4 billion (7.7 trillion rubles) last year, Dmitriev told TASS today.  The Russian budget--excluding the NWF--received an additional US$113 billion (7 trillion rubles) during the years in which the deal has been in force, he added.\"This largely indicates that the NWF resources through the fiscal rule have come exactly from the OPEC+ deal, increasing our reserves twofold,\" Dmitriev said. Related: This Emerging Oil Hotspot Threatens The OPEC DealThe investments the NWF plans for various projects of national importance \"are mainly the investment of extra money Russia has earned on account of the OPEC+ deal,\" Dmitriev told TASS.Crude oil and condensate production in Russia hit a record high for the post-Soviet era in 2019, despite Moscow's key role in supporting the ongoing OPEC+ production cuts. The new record oil production shows that one of the key parties to the OPEC+ deal, and certainly the key party in the non-OPEC camp of producers in the agreement, did not comply with its share of the cuts for most of 2019.Removing condensate from the level of compliance--a concession Russia won at the December OPEC+ meeting--would make Russia's compliance record look more acceptable to OPEC's leader and key partner in the deal, Saudi Arabia, which is pushing for all rogue producers in the pact to fall in line with their quotas.

Iraq awarded six of the 11 blocks to Middle East and China-based companies, while five of the exploration areas up for grabs failed to attract any bids.The exploration contracts in the fifth round will be for fields in the province of Diyala in eastern Iraq, which are expected to produce over 750 million cubic feet of natural gas within three years.

The beginning of the sale process for Exxon's UK assets is expected to be imminent, while the U.S. supermajor will start pitching its German assets to potential buyers after that, according to Bloomberg's sources.For months, Exxon is reported to be looking to sell its assets in the UK, which will make it the latest U.S. oil company to quit the UK North Sea.Exxon has interests in nearly 40 producing oil and gas fields in the UK North Sea, and its investment offshore the UK is managed through a 50/50 joint operation with Shell, which is the main operator of many of the fields in the joint operation. Exxon's output accounts for around five percent of UK oil and gas production, supplying the UK and international markets with an average of 80,000 barrels of oil and 441 million cubic feet of gas a day, the U.S. supermajor says.Exxon's upstream assets in Germany had total production of around 45,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2018, according to a review of the company cited by Bloomberg.Two months ago, banking sources told Reuters that Exxon is considerably increasing its global asset sales program, expecting to shed oil and gas assets in Asia, Europe, and Africa worth up to US$25 billion. According to Rystad Energy's estimates, Exxon could raise between US$1 billion and US$2 billion from its UK North Sea assets.Exxon has an official target to sell US$15 billion worth of non-strategic assets by 2021. By the end of Q3 2019, the supermajor had reached nearly one-third of the US$15-billion asset sale target, chairman and chief executive officer Darren Woods said in the Q3 results release in November.Exxon is selling assets it no longer considers core operations as it is now focused on the Permian and Guyana.

The ramp-up added more than 100,000 bpd to the country's total production between October and November.The presalt zone has become the center of attention of the Brazilian oil industry now that the government settled its dispute with Petrobras regarding the handling of an area that falls within the zone. The area could hold up to 15 billion barrels of untapped crude, which would double Brazil's total reserves to 30 billion barrels and make it the world's fifth-largest oil producer.Meanwhile, it emerged that Brazil may join OPEC soon, with talks likely to begin in July this year. Brazil's president is on board with the idea--Jair Bolsonaro said last October that Saudi Arabia had invited Brazil to join the cartel--but the industry is not so enthusiastic.If the country becomes an OPEC member it would have to comply with production control agreements at a time of rising oil production, and Petrobras plans to further the rise. This could be precisely why OPEC wants Brazil to become a member: according to the group's production forecasts, Brazil will be the second-largest contributor of non-OPEC production growth this year, after the United States.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "All options are on the table for the next summit of the OPEC+ coalition in March, including further cuts in oil production, Saudi Arabia's Energy Minister, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, said on Thursday, Al Arabiya television reports.At the OPEC+ meeting in December, OPEC and its Russia-led partners decided to deepen the current cuts by 500,000 bpd in the first quarter of 2020, when demand is expected at its weakest for 2020. This brings total production reductions at 1.7 million bpd--that is if rogue members fall in line with their quotas.Considering the pledge from OPEC's largest producer and de facto leader Saudi Arabia that it would continue to significantly overcomply with its share of the cuts, the total OPEC+ cuts could be as high as 2.1 million bpd, OPEC said.Saudi Arabia will work for stable oil prices amid heightened tensions in the Middle East, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said at an energy conference in Saudi Arabia last week.\"We would like to have a stable oil market, sustainable growth in terms of demand, sustainable growth in terms of supply,\" the Saudi energy minister said, as carried by Asharq al-Awsat.\"The worst thing is to have low oil prices that permanently damage industry,\" according to Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman.Saudi Arabia needs oil prices at above US$80 to balance its budget this year, according to estimates from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).When OPEC and non-OPEC ministers meet in Vienna in March to discuss how to proceed with their production-cutting price-fixing policy, they will have to consider not only fundamentals but also the fact that heightened tension in the Middle East and a major outage in Libya have not moved oil prices up, despite the fact that virtually all of Libya's production--1.2 million bpd--is currently offline.

        "content": "Ten oil tankers capable of carrying some 8 million barrels of oil are idling near some of Libya's oil export terminals, tanker-tracking data monitored by Bloomberg showed on Thursday, as the Libyan port blockade entered an ugly sixth day.Groups loyal to eastern strongman General Khalifa Haftar blocked virtually all exports from the African oil producer, and when storage reaches maximum capacity, it will result in a complete loss of all of Libya's 1.2 million barrels per day of oil production and exports.\"Shutdown of all affected oil fields will result in a loss of crude oil production of 1.2 million b/d and daily financial losses of approximately $77 million,\" Libya's National Oil Corporation (NOC) said on Monday, confirming that nearly all of the OPEC member's production will be lost due to the blockade.This is the largest outage on the oil market since the September attacks on Saudi Arabia's oil facilities, yet it has failed to move oil prices higher.Market participants are largely ignoring the Libyan outage and are focused on the prospects of global oil demand growth this year and the pace of supply increase from non-OPEC producers, primarily the United States, Brazil, Guyana, and Norway.In addition, the new fear on the market, the outbreak of a coronavirus in China, could cut oil demand and push oil prices down by nearly $3 a barrel, Goldman Sachs said earlier this week.  \"However while markets are obsessing over virus developments, they seem to be ignoring a number of oil supply risks in the market, which in aggregate would far outweigh the demand impact from the Wuhan virus,\" ING strategists said on Thursday.  According to ING's estimates, the current outages around the world sum up to around 1.4 million bpd, \"which would be more than enough to shift the global market into deficit over 1H20,\" said Warren Patterson, ING's Head of Commodities Strategy and Senior Commodities Strategist Wenyu Yao.  \"While the market may shrug at supply losses from Libya, it would be more difficult for the market to ignore large Iraqi supply losses if they became a reality, as Iraq is OPEC's second-largest producer,\" they noted.

The EIA's estimates, however, were of a draw of 2.5 million barrels for that week.Oil prices were down earlier in the day prior to the afternoon data release, despite continued unrest in oil-rich Iraq and a near-complete oil production disruption in Libya, as fears of economic slowdown once again surface--this time not from the trade dispute between the United States and China, but due to a deadly SARS-like virus known as coronavirus in China that now shows a confirmed case in the United States.At 2:24 pm EST on Wednesday, the WTI benchmark was trading down $1.34 (-2.30%) at $57.04, roughly $1.30 per barrel under last week's levels. The price of a Brent barrel was also trading down on Wednesday, by $1.11 (-1.72%), at $63.48--roughly $1.10 under last week's prices.The API this week also reported another large build of 4.5 million barrels of gasoline for week ending January 17, after last week's large 3.2-million-barrel build. This week's large gasoline build compares to analyst expectations of a 3.090-million barrel-build for the week.Distillate, too, saw inventories increase, by 3.5 million barrels for the week, adding onto last week's large 6.8-million-barrel build, while Cushing inventories fell by 429,000 barrels.US crude oil production as estimated by the Energy Information Administration showed that production for the week ending January 10 increased to 13.0 million bpd, a record high for the United States.At 4:43 pm EDT, WTI was trading at $56.60, while Brent was trading at $63.07.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "A suggestion by the UK Committee on Climate Change to burn more wood and plant replacement trees as a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels has drawn criticism from think tank Chatham House, which says this is hardly the best approach to reducing emissions.\"Expanding forest cover is undoubtedly a good thing, if you're leaving them standing,\" energy expert Duncan Brack told the Daily Telegraph. However, Brack, who served as special adviser to the Department of Energy and Climate Change, suggested that burning wood for heating was not the most sustainable way forward. Calling wood burning a carbon neutral process is \"highly dubious,\" Brack added.These claims, according to the Telegraph's environment editor, Emma Gatten, rest on the assumption that the carbon footprint of chopping down trees and burning them is offset by planting new trees to replace them. This assumption excludes the fact that older trees absorb more carbon and that it takes time to replace a forest.\"You can leave trees standing and they will continue to absorb carbon for decades,\" Brack says. \"But the biomass industry implicitly assumes that forests at some point stop reach a saturation point for carbon intake and can be harvested and simply replaced.\" The benefit of planting trees to mitigate the effects of climate change has been put to the test on a wider scale as well. A study released last year found that reforestation could work, but it had to be done at a massive scale.We need to plant 25 percent more trees than there are on Earth right now, or more than half a trillion in total, the study found. This would reduce the amount of carbon in the atmosphere by a quarter, erasing 20 years of emissions. Yet it would not solve the climate problem on its own, without a sustained effort to cut emissions, commentators on the study said.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Qatar, the largest source of liquefied natural gas (LNG) for India currently, is not too keen to renegotiate the pricing of its long-term supply contract with India, Qatari Energy Minister Saad Sherida al-Kaabi said on Monday.Al-Kaabi, who also serves as chief executive at Qatar Petroleum, is on a visit to India, where India's Minister of Petroleum, Dharmendra Pradhan, said earlier on Monday that his country would like to renegotiate the prices in its long-term supply contract with Qatar.The two ministers \"explored ways to make LNG more affordable for a price sensitive market like India, especially in our long-term contact,\" Pradhan said on Twitter after a meeting with the Qatari minister.\"Qatar is our largest source of LNG. India's appetite for energy, particularly gas is increasing considerably. We see an enormous potential to further expand India-Qatar energy ties and also expect to increase our bilateral engagements beyond buyer-seller relationship,\" the Indian minister added.  India currently imports around 8.5 million tons of LNG from Qatar under long-term supply deals, according to Reuters estimates.But spot LNG prices for the fuel delivered at Indian ports are currently around half the price compared to that in the long-term supply contracts. So Qatar's LNG prices under long-term supply contracts are now much less appealing to India, which has set a goal to more than double the share of natural gas in its energy mix by 2030.\"The surge in India's energy requirements will not be incremental but exponential. India is rapidly expanding its gas infrastructure to cater to the needs of nearly 70% of our population. An estimated investment of $60 billion is lined up in building the gas infrastructure,\" Pradhan said today.Last month, the minister said that India would surpass China to become the world's largest energy growth driver by 2030. India aims to move to a gas-based economy and looks to invest around $100 billion in energy infrastructure, including renewables, he said.

President Trump has vowed to protect Syrian oil fields from ISIS, and the United States may leave 500 troops in northeastern Syria and send in battle tanks and other equipment with the purpose to help the Kurds in the area to protect oil fields that used to be controlled by Islamic State during its so-called caliphate in parts of Iraq and Syria.Last month, Turkish media reported that the United States had moved more equipment from Iraq into Syria to boost the protection of the oil and gas fields in eastern Syria.

        "content": "Rolls-Royce plans to install by 2029 mini nuclear reactors in the UK that would be built in factories and delivered in modules, the chief technology officer of Britain's industrial technology manufacturer told the BBC.\"The trick is to have prefabricated parts where we use advanced digital welding methods and robotic assembly and then parts are shipped to site and bolted together,\" Rolls-Royce's chief technology officer Paul Stein told the BBC's Today program.   For several years, Rolls-Royce has been leading a UK consortium for the so-called Small Modular Reactor (SMR) program to manufacture and deliver mini reactors. According to Rolls-Royce, the SMR design makes those reactors so compact that they can be transported by truck, train, or even barge.Once fully developed, the so-called small modular reactors (SMRs) could be manufactured in factories and transported to site, the UK government said. SMRs are smaller than conventional nuclear power station reactors, with power outputs of around 300 MW or less.In view of the enormous cost overruns of nuclear power plants recently, including the Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant in the UK, mini reactors from Rolls-Royce that are much smaller and can be easily transported to the site could be a win for nuclear power in Britain.Rolls-Royce says that \"By building numerous versions of the same product in a controlled 'production line' environment, economies become deliverable, making each unit more affordable than a stand-alone bespoke major project.\" Critics say that the 'assembly-line' benefits may be overstated.Moreover, critics of nuclear power say that the UK should continue to add more renewable power capacity and ditch nuclear energy.Others, however, say that nuclear power will help the UK achieve its 2050 net zero emissions goal.In June last year, the UK became the first major economy in the world to enshrine in a law its target to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050.

We don't want restrictions, we want to increase our production.\"Interestingly, it was Albuquerque who told Reuters earlier this month that Brazil would begin talks with OPEC to discussing joining it later this year.But now the minister said that even if the talks were successful, Brazil would not join the cartel this year.The idea is said to have originated with Brazil's President, Jair Bolsonaro, who last year said that OPEC's top producer and de facto leader Saudi Arabia had informally asked Brazil to join the organization.\"I personally would very much like Brazil to become a member of OPEC,\" Bolsonaro said at the Future Investment Initiative 2019 in Riyadh in October.Even though the latest plans are to stay out of the cartel, Albuquerque told Bloomberg that Brazil was open to a dialogue with OPEC on energy-related topics. At the same time, the country will seek oil tender feedback from international oil companies to improve turnout.\"Petrobras has a lot of oil and lot of areas to exploit, but it doesn't have enough funds to prospect all these areas,\" the minister told Bloomberg. \"There's a limit for Petrobras.

Production has resumed at full capacity of 70,000 bpd.Al Ahdab is operated by China's CNPC, but it was blockaded last week by security guards who are protesting against the absence of permanent employment contracts. There was also another field at risk of closure in the vicinity, Badra, which produces about 50,000 bpd. Russia's Gazprom Neft is the operator of that field.Now the Iraqi authorities have agreed to provide the Al Ahdab security guards with permanent employment contracts and the protesters have lifted the blockade of the field.Economic protests began in Iraq last October and have since then escalated into anti-government demonstrations. According to Bloomberg, as many as 600 people have died during the demonstrations, which have regularly led to clashes with security forces.The protests shut down another oil field twice in less than a month. The Nassiriya field, in southern Iraq, was first shut down in December and then earlier this month as protesters demanded jobs, the Iraq Oil Report wrote. Nassiriya produces some 80,000 bpd.So far, the effect of the protests on oil production in OPEC's number-two exporter has been temporary. In December, the country pumped 4.65 million bpd. However, its production expansion plans have been put at risk by the protests as the foreign companies that would be responsible for them have started pulling their personnel out of the country.In more bad oil news, BP dropped its plans to expand production from the Kirkuk fields in northern Iraq after exploration results fell short of expectations.On the flip side, Baghdad announced plans to resume production at four oil fields in northern Iraq, in the Nineveh governorate. These fields were destroyed by the Islamic State, which used to control these territories before the Kurdish and Iraqi security forces drove it out.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

The new discovery, at the Uaru well, is just 10 miles northeast of the Liza oilfield, which is already producing oil.Guyana officially joined the ranks of oil producing nations at the end of December, after Exxon and its partners began oil production offshore the South American country.Days after launching Guyana's first-ever crude oil production, Exxon announced its 15th discovery on the Stabroek Block. The discovery at the Mako-1 well adds to the previously announced estimated recoverable resource of more than 6 billion oil-equivalent barrels on the Stabroek Block, Exxon said on December 23.And now, in its resource update today, Exxon announced its 16th find, the Uaru discover, which is its first of 2020 in offshore Guyana. The amount of oil will be added to the now 8-billion-barrel resource estimate at a later date.Four drillships are currently exploring new resources and developing resources at approved projects offshore Guyana, Exxon said, adding that a fifth ship is set to be deployed later in 2020.The Liza Phase 1 production is ramping up and will produce up to 120,000 bpd in the coming months. The floating production storage and offloading vessel (FPSO) with 220,000-bpd capacity, which will be used for the Phase 2 development, is currently under construction and is expected to begin oil production by the middle of 2022.Exxon also hopes production from the Payara oilfield north of the Liza discoveries could start as early as 2023, reaching 220,000 bpd.

Year over year, the Permian basin's production in February 2020 would be an increase of 800,000 bpd.In the January 2020 Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO), the EIA estimates that total U.S. crude oil production averaged 12.2 million bpd last year, a rise by 1.3 million bpd compared to 2018. This year, EIA sees U.S. crude oil production averaging 13.3 million bpd, while the average American crude oil production will be 13.7 million bpd in 2021, with the Permian accounting for most of the growth.

        "content": "An Alberta association of landowners who have oil and gas sites on their properties has called on its members to cut off power to drilling sites of companies that have failed to pay their compensation to landowners or have failed to clean up their sites.The Action Surface Rights Association, which groups around 200 landowners in southern Alberta--the heart of Canada's energy industry--is urging its members to respond to the industry's inadequate handling of reclaiming oil and gas wells and the unpaid compensation to the landowners, The Canadian Press reports.Most of the oil and gas wells in Canada are drilled on private property, and while property owners cannot deny access to drillers, they are entitled to compensation.In view of the struggles of Alberta's oil industry in recent years, some companies have stopped paying compensation to the landowners. Now the association of property owners is fighting back.\"Turn off the power and shut off the valves ... just like any landlord would change the locks for a tenant who does not pay,\" Daryl Bennett of the Action Surface Rights Association urged the landowners, The Canadian Press reports.The landowners are also angry with the industry's track record of cleaning up well sites years and even decades after a company has stopped drilling at a site, Financial Post reported last month.The Orphan Well Association (OWA), an industry-funded group that picks up the tab for decommissioning and cleaning up wells for companies that have gone bankrupt and can't sell their assets, is trying to prioritize those wells that are considered a hazard for the public and environment, the association's Lars DePauw told Financial Post's Geoffrey Morgan.As of November 1, 2019, there were 3,406 orphan wells for abandonment in Alberta, according to OWA data.Landowners fear that thousands more wells could add to the orphan well list in view of the not-so-rosy outlook on Canada's oil industry and that they may not get their compensations soon, if ever.

According to Lord Stern, China needs to reduce its reliance on coal, which continues to drive emissions despite the massive uptake of renewable energy sources.Despite a rise in renewables, China continues to expand its coal-fired plant fleet, and although Beijing continues with its coal-to-gas switch policy, its coal capacity will continue to grow in the coming years.According to the BP Energy Outlook 2019, coal demand in China peaked in 2013, but the country will remain the world's largest consumer of coal throughout the next two decades, accounting for 39 percent of global coal demand in 2040. Carbon emissions in China are expected to peak in 2022, as per BP's estimates.China has pledged that its total CO2 emissions would peak by 2030 and its carbon intensity would fall sharply by then.China's greenhouse gas emissions jumped by 53.5 percent in the decade between 2005 and 2014, according to Chinese government figures that Beijing is obliged to report as a signatory to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.Carbon emissions data from China is opaque, but the country is required to regularly report data to the United Nations. China has previously reported carbon emission data for 2005 and 2010.  According to a Greenpeace analysis on Chinese data, China's CO2 emissions rose by some 3 percent in 2018, which was the biggest rise since at least 2013.Climate Action Tracker rates China's commitment to action as \"highly insufficient\" and not at all consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement.

        "content": "2019 may have been fraught with volatile oil prices, but the world's largest oil traders made a killing last year, Bloomberg reported on Monday.\"By all accounts, 2019 was among the best years ever for the energy trading industry,\" Marco Dunand, chief executive of energy trader Mercuria Energy Group LTD, said.Mercuria is one of the world's largest oil traders.Other traders including Vitol and Trafigura reaped the benefits of a turbulent 2019 as well--but Shell and BP, which have in-house trading units, deal in even more crude oil, trading 13 million and 10.9 million barrels of crude oil per day.BP and Shell raked in billions last year on their oil trading arms, with Shell reportedly making $1 billion off fuel-oil trading due to the IMO2020 changes.Gunvor, who trades 2.5 million barrels a day, said that 2019 was \"up there among the best years ever.\"Trafigura, who already reported its 2019 results as their fiscal year ended in September, saw a record year for gross profits of $1.7 billion, trading 6 million barrels daily. Vitol--the largest oil trader that's not part of Big Oil, is expected to report nearly $2 billion in earnings.The reason for the banner year in the oil trading business was, according to senior traders and top executives interviewed by Bloomberg, a rather fortuitous combination of oil market influences. Supply outages in Venezuela and Iran boosted premiums that traders could charge to refineries. Then came the Russian tainted oil debacle. Then, Saudi Arabia's supply disruption in the wake of a terrorist attack on Aramco's infrastructure that temporarily took offline 5 million bpd. Then, there was the IMO2020 rules.All these disruptions created a perfect money-making storm.For BP, Shell, and Total--the do-it-alls of the oil industry, including trading--the money made on the trading side is a welcome addition to the balance sheet as oil and gas prices falter.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is preparing to release new oil speculation rules that would limit the number of positions hedge funds and other speculators can open on oil and other commodities, Bloomberg has reported, citing unnamed sources in the know.However, the new rules could end up benefiting traders, according to the Bloomberg sources, as they would include higher maximum thresholds for commodity bets for some commodity contracts that are physically settled. The reason, the source said, was that the CFTC has based the new rules on data about deliverable supplies of various commodities, and that data suggests that the amount of these deliverable supplies is higher than earlier estimations suggested.The need for tougher regulation on commodity speculation was one of the consequences of the 2008 financial crisis. Over the last ten years, however, the CFTC has met with strong opposition from powerful stakeholders in the commodity sphere, including the energy industry, among others. Now, however, this opposition could quieten as the rules would favor large speculators, according to the Bloomberg sources.Currently, the CFTC has position limits on nine agricultural commodity contracts. Bourses, for their part, impose their own limits on energy and precious metals futures. With the new rules, the Bloomberg source said, the CFTC position limits are likely to be higher than those imposed by exchanges and exchanges might end up having to relax their limits in response to the official ones.All in all, according to the sources, it would be better for stakeholders in the commodity trading area if the new rules are approved now rather than after the elections in November when the CFTC could see a change of management. Democrats, the logic goes, would be a lot stricter than Republicans in setting futures speculation limits, so it is in the interest of those opposing any changes so far to play along with the CFTC.The commission is voting on the new rules on Thursday.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

But the US benchmark price inched up slightly on Tuesday, to $53.40, suggesting that the worst of the market selloff courtesy of the Coronavirus could possibly be behind us.Brent prices fell nearly $7 per barrel, from $65.20 a week ago Monday, to $58.58 yesterday.While oil prices appear to have stopped falling, the virus is still on a tear, reaching more than 10 countries with over 100 lives lost, nearly 5,000 infected, and travel severely restricted in and out of certain regions in China--a fact which has sparked fear that oil demand could be dented as a result of the subdued economic activity and plethora of canceled flights.And on Tuesday, the CDC announced that in conjunction with the US State Department, that travelers avoid \"unnecessary travel to China.\"Oil demand concerns were already at the forefront of the oil market for most of last year, and this new hitch has been more than major outages in Libya could offset. Until now, demand for jet fuel in China has remained healthy.Some oil stocks had also stopped this week's brutal slide on Tuesday, with ConocoPhillips, Phillips 66, EOG Resources, Exxon, Total, Chevron, and Occidental all clawing back some of their previous losses.BP, Shell, and Hess, however, were still trading down on the day as of Tuesday afternoon.In a press conference on Tuesday, the CDC's Health Secretary Alex Azar warned Americans that \"This is a very fast moving, constantly changing situation,\" adding that \"part of the risk we face right now is that we don't know everything we need to know about this virus.\"By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

The EIA's estimates, however, were of a draw of 400,000 barrels for that week.Oil prices were up earlier in the day prior to the afternoon data release, ending a five day price slide as fears of oil demand destruction at the hands of the deadly Coronavirus gripped the oil markets. Even with Libya's near-complete production shutdown of nearly 1 million barrels per day, oil prices were still down week over week.At 3:43 pm EST on Tuesday the WTI benchmark was trading up $0.46 (+0.87%) at $53.60--roughly down $5 per barrel under last week's levels. The price of a Brent barrel was also trading up slightly on Tuesday, by $0.33 (+0.56%), at $58.91--off more than $6 per barrel compared to last week's prices.The API this week also reported a build of 3.27 million barrels of gasoline for week ending January 24, after last week's large 4.5-million-barrel build. This week's large gasoline build compares to analyst expectations of a 1.32-million barrel-build for the week.Distillate inventories were down by 141,000 barrels for the week, compared to last week's large 3.5-million-barrel build, while Cushing inventories rose by 1.02 million barrels.US crude oil production as estimated by the Energy Information Administration showed that production for the week ending January 17 held fast at 13.0 million bpd, a record high for the United States.At 4:43 pm EDT, WTI was trading at $53.57, while Brent was trading at $58.88.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

The two exploration deals call for a total investment of at least US$332 million, according to a statement from Egypt's petroleum ministry, carried by Reuters.At the end of 2019, ExxonMobil said that it had acquired more than 1.7 million acres offshore Egypt, adding upstream interests to its downstream business in the country.Exxon bought the 1.2-million-acre North Marakia Offshore block, five miles offshore Egypt's northern coast and 543,000 acres in the North East El Amriya Offshore block in the Nile Delta. ExxonMobil, which will be the operator of both blocks with 100-percent interest, plans to start exploration operations this year.\"These awards strengthen our exploration portfolio in the Eastern Mediterranean,\" Mike Cousins, senior vice president of exploration and new ventures at ExxonMobil, said in a statement at the end of December.Last year, Exxon made a natural gas discovery at the Glaucus-1 well in a block offshore Cyprus.Offshore Egypt, the discovery of the giant Zohr gas field in 2015 has sparked interest in more exploration in the Mediterranean.Exxon's foray into Egypt's upstream comes at a time of heightened tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean, where Turkey, Greece, and Cyprus are at odds over Turkey's claim to natural gas resources recently discovered offshore Cyprus.Turkey will continue exploring for oil and gas in the eastern Mediterranean waters around disputed Cyprus, and \"No project can be realised if Turkey and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus are not involved,\" Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdo?an said in August last year.Since then, Ankara has been moving forward with its drilling plans despite criticism from not just Cyprus but also Greece and the European Union. Earlier this month, the EU warned Turkey to reconsider its drilling plans after Erdogan said drilling would start \"as soon as possible.\" The EU also called these exploration plans illegal.

More than 80 percent of Hess's capital and exploratory budget for 2020 will go for increased production and development of the corporation's production in the Bakken in North Dakota and offshore Guyana, where Hess is a minority partner of ExxonMobil in the first development of the Latin American country's oil resources.Hess expects its net production to average between 330,000 and 335,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) this year, excluding Libya operations. Net production in the Bakken is seen averaging 180,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2020.\"In the Bakken, we plan to maintain a six rig program through the year, which is expected to result in our net production growing to approximately 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by the end of 2020,\" chief operating officer Greg Hill said in a statement.Offshore Guyana, Hess will focus on the Liza Phase 2 development, the front end engineering design (FEED) work to develop the nearby Payara oilfield, and on exploration. Hess plans to explore for resources in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, too, Hill noted.Just yesterday, Exxon and Hess said they had revised upward the estimate of recoverable resources offshore Guyana by 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent to 8 billion oil-equivalent barrels, also announcing the 16th oil discovery on the Stabroek Block.\"We also continue to see multibillion barrels of additional exploration potential remaining,\" said John Hess, chief executive of Hess, which holds 30 percent in the Stabroek Block, where Exxon is the operator.

Outside Russia, the privately owned Russian oil producer sees development and investment opportunities in West Africa, which is one of the most promising markets, Alekperov said.Lukoil is already present in three countries in West Africa, while another four countries in the region offer the Russian company joint development work, the manager told Putin.Russian oil companies are encouraged to work in West Africa after a Russia-Africa summit which Putin hosted in October.Lukoil is looking at joint oil and gas opportunities with Saudi Aramco in Africa, Alekperov said at the Russia-Africa forum in October. Lukoil and the Saudi oil giant are in good relations and constantly exploring joint opportunities in third countries, including in Africa, the Russian manager said.Now Russian companies, including Lukoil, are looking for deals in West Africa.In Russia, Lukoil expects that total Russian crude oil and condensate production could rise to more than 12 million bpd by 2035, if global demand for liquid hydrocarbons continues to grow, the company said in a new forecast last month. Currently, Russia pumps around 11.2 million bpd of oil and condensate.Referring to the U.S. sanctions on Russia's oil industry, Lukoil said that although these restrictions are unlikely to impact domestic production in the near term, they will have a significant impact in the long term. Commenting on the OPEC+ deal, which Russian firms have criticized, Lukoil said in December after the OPEC+ meeting that \"We expect that Russia will remain a party to the OPEC+ Agreement for a long time, coordinating its activities with other oil-producing nations.\"  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "title": "Miners Eye New Tech To Cut Diesel Dependence",
        "content": "Diesel genset efficiency optimization is sparking interest among miners, a new report by THEnergy reveals.The approach is based on conventional steam turbine technology, but advances have allowed it to be deployed at a smaller scale. The principle behind it is addressing the issue of diesel engines being able to convert only 40 percent of the fuel energy into electricity, while the rest is not used. Waste heat recovery can reduce diesel consumption by approximately 7 percent, and in turn, lend a hand with the growing climate conundrum with which miners are grappling.According to THEnergy, the method is already proven in applications like biogas engine heat recovery, biomass combustion, industrial waste heat, and geothermal heat.\"Waste heat recovery is the low hanging fruit in the diesel reduction game,\" said Thomas Hillig, the consultancy's managing director, in a media statement. \"Renewables have recently opened the door for new approaches because they have increased the acceptance of more capital-intensive solutions in the mining industry.\"In Hilling's view, heat recovery can go hand-in-hand with renewable energy approaches for diesel reduction. \"In a time when cost optimization and carbon mitigation are gaining importance, the question is not which of the two solutions to choose. The answer is to combine both solutions together,\" the expert said. Gensets could back these existing clean energy solutions at mine sites. (Image courtesy of THEnergy).Related: 5 Reasons Why Big Oil Is Here To StayTHEnergy's document explains that the heat recovery solution works by connecting two standard 20-foot shipping containers to the exhaust gas stack of diesel gensets. What happens next is that the e-box generates electricity from the waste heat. The electricity is fed into the local grid, so that diesel gensets do not need to produce this power and subsequently consume less fuel.Since the e-box converts waste heat, it is a zero-carbon technology which addresses the drive for cleaner mining. A single e-box saves 300,000 litres of diesel per year. This is approximately the same as a 0.7 MW solar power plant in a rather sunny region. Annual CO2 reductions amount to 800 tons per e-box. \"In the quickly growing market of renewable energy solutions for remote mines, efficiency improvements of gensets can generate competitive advantages for mining companies and energy providers by pulling all the cost-efficient diesel reduction levers of onsite power plants,\" said in the report Henning von Barsewisch, CEO of Triogen, a supplier of decentralized power generation equipment derived from the steam turbine process. Henning explained that the e-box solution has successfully been field-tested for mining applications and is now being deployed at the remote site of a blue-chip mining company.

They added that they expected OPEC to step in and cut production deeper to ensure the balance of the oil market.The downward revision from Barclays comes just a week after the bank said that it expects global crude demand growth to pick up in 2020 thanks to an improving global economic outlook.Meanwhile, however, one OPEC member is involuntarily cutting production. Libya's National Oil Corporation said earlier this week production had slumped by more than two-thirds over the last week, from over 1.2 million bpd to about 300,000 bpd. The drop followed the blockade of oil export terminals and the consequent shutdown of several oil fields.The situation could deteriorate further, NOC's chairman Mustafa Sanalla said, with production falling to as little as 72,000 bpd.It seems, however, that traders have yet to read the news from Libya: at the time of writing Brent crude and WTI were both trading lower than yesterday, with Brent at $58.48 a barrel and WTI at $53.17 a barrel, extending a six-day losing streak.In case the market already knows the news from Libya, then the excess supply situation could be worse than some may have believed or the coronavirus developments are outweighing any concern about tightening supply because of Libya.In fact, according to Barclays, the coronavirus outbreak is likely to cause less economic problems than the SARS outbreak in 2003 because of its lower lethality and because of the Chinese authorities' measures to contain the spread of the disease.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

It is unlikely to return there soon in the midst of new shareholder demands and a shift in priorities.Shareholders are insisting on more returns after the 2014 price crash. But a growing number of them are also insisting that oil companies diversify away from their core business of extracting and selling fossil fuels. Even if the shareholder petitions initiated by Dutch group Share This continue to fail, they are symptomatic of a change in thinking among investors that Big Oil should have already detected.Yet instead of diversifying away from its core business, Exxon is investing heavily in new oil and gas assets, Bloomberg's Kevin Crowley notes. The company was probably emboldened by one of the longest strings of oil discoveries off the coast of Guyana and this year plans to spend $30 billion on developing these and other assets, including LNG in Mozambique, with the option of spending even more than that.Yet this is problematic for shareholder returns because Exxon does not have enough cash on hand for dividends and will have to fund these from asset sales and debt, according to Edward Jones & Co analyst Jennifer Rowland, who spoke to Crowley.It is not just the difference in company and shareholder priorities, either. Most analyst seem to expect oil demand to weaken this year on the back of the China coronavirus outbreak, and with plenty of supply available, Exxon's grand plans for Guyana may boomerang.The company is reporting fourth-quarter financial results this Friday and analysts expect a lower result than a year earlier.

The alleged Houthi attack came as retaliation for \"escalating air strikes,\" on Yemen by the Saudi coalition, and if confirmed, this would be the first attack from Yemen's Houthis on targets in Saudi Arabia since the end of September, Reuters notes.   Back in September, just after the attacks on Saudi Aramco's oil facilities Abqaiq and Khurais, the Houthis pledged to halt attacks with drones and ballistic missiles against Saudi Arabian targets if Saudi Arabia stopped air strikes on Yemen.  Saudi Arabia and Iran are essentially fighting a proxy war in Yemen, where the Saudis lead a military Arab coalition to \"restore legitimacy\" in the country, while the Houthi movement, which holds the capital Sanaa, is backed by Iran.Yahya Saria, a military spokesman for the Houthi movement, said on Wednesday, as carried by Reuters, that apart from facilities owned by Saudi Aramco, the Houthis also targeted the airports of Abha and Jizan.The Houthis have claimed responsibility for the September 14 attacks on Saudi Aramco's oil facilities that cut off 5 percent of daily global supply for weeks. But Saudi Arabia and the United States have said that it was Iran--and not the Houthis--who was responsible for the attack.The Houthi rebels in Yemen were not the ones who launched the drone and missile attack on Saudi oil infrastructure last September, a confidential report from the UN revealed earlier this month.\"That despite their claims to the contrary, the Houthi forces did not launch the attacks on Abqaiq and Khurais on 14 September 2019,\" Reuters quoted the report's authors from the UN Security Council Yemen sanctions committee as saying.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Teck Resources is uncertain it will go ahead with a planned oil sands project that is awaiting the approval of the federal Canadian government, the Canadian Press reports, citing Teck's chief executive.The Frontier project, estimated to be worth $15.6 billion (C$20.6 billion), is an open oil sands mine that would yield 260,000 bpd at peak production, with its life estimated at 40 years. Yet it must first be approved by the Liberal government that has strict climate change fighting goals.According to Teck Resources' CEO Don Lindsay, however, the project may not go through even if the government grants it approval. The problem, he said during an investor conference in Alberta, was oil prices, among other things. Frontier's profitability was based on higher oil prices, much higher than they are now. When it was first floated, the plan saw profitability at a West Texas Intermediate price of $75 per barrel. WTI is currently trading at a little over $50 a barrel and hasn't touched $70 for years.At the moment, the federal government's decision on the Frontier project is closely watched by all stakeholders. According to some, this decision could seal the fate of the Canadian oil sands industry, which is why it is very likely that the government will delay it as it seeks to find a way to please two opposing camps that have no meeting point. The pro-oil camp wants the industry to grow. The pro-climate camp is fixated on emission reduction.Whatever Prime Minister Trudeau decides, one of these groups will be unhappy.Yet if the government does approve the project and Teck Resources decides not to go ahead with it, this could be an even harder blow to the industry, a sign that the investment climate and the oil price environment has worsened so much that it is making projects that were deemed profitable just three years ago, unprofitable.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

The death toll is rising, too, with the latest figure at 160.The outbreak has shaken commodity markets with a particularly hard impact on oil prices. Investment banks warned of a sizeable downside risk for benchmarks from the outbreak, which could--and most probably would--affect China's economic growth and hence its oil demand.The impact is already being felt after the institution of quarantines at a time of the year that normally sees increased passenger traffic during the Lunar New Year holidays. With people now obliged to stay at home, this travel is simply not happening.If oil demand does weaken for an extended period of time, Brazil will be among the most affected suppliers of crude to China. The bulk of Petrobras' oil exports during the first nine months of 2019 were bound for China, Argus Media writes, citing company data. That was 72 percent of the almost half a million bpd Petrobras shipped abroad.Purchases for January and February stand at over 500,000 bpd as the light and medium oil pumped from the Lula field in the presalt zone has become a favored feedstock among independent Chinese refiners.\"For the export of oil to this country, there are no changes in the schedule and possible logistical adjustments are being studied,\" Petrobras told Argus.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

At the same time, however, both Saudi Arabia and the UAE tried to downplay what it referred to as a \"market over-reaction\" to the possibility that the virus could dent oil demand in the world's largest oil importer, China.\"It is important that we do not exaggerate projections related to future decreases in oil demand due to events in China, and the market does not over-react based on psychological factors, driven by some traders in the market,\" the UAE's energy minister Suhail al-Mazrouei said on Monday.But the virus has progressed since then, and so too has the effects on demand. With the death toll reaching 132 and the number of infected reaching nearly 6,000, many flights have been cancelled to and from China, posing a tangible threat to jet fuel demand.The decision about moving the meeting up will be made \"in the coming days\" Arkab said.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Pemex's CEO Octavio Romero Oropeza has announced the company's desire to operate a large offshore oil area that was discovered by a Talos Energy-led consortium, Reuters reported on Wednesday.The 2C recoverable resource estimate for the oil in question is 670 million barrels, which is located in the Zama reservoir that spans multiple blocks, and as such, is the subject of a high-stakes debate.Pemex claims that most of oil riches lie in its block, while Talos claims that according to an independent oil consulting firm, 60% of the oil lies in the private consortium's block, Block 7, which is directly adjacent to Pemex's.Part of Pemex's argument for wanting to handle the operations of the area, aside from claiming that most of reservoir is in its portion, is that it would bring Zama online quicker than Talos could. So far, Talos has drilled a couple exploratory wells in its side, while Pemex has yet to drill any.According to Romero, Pemex could bring Zama into production in 2021, whereas Talos, Romero alleges, isn't planning on producing until 2024. Talos, however, provided its own timeline for production earlier this month, setting a first-oil target for 2023.Nothing will happen, however, until Pemex and Talos reach an agreement on the development plans, which have been ongoing for a year.In December, Pemex announced another large deposit that could hold 500 million barrels of crude in a 3P reserves. If this estimate is accurate, this would be the largest find in decades.Pemex has suffered annual declines in the amount of oil it produces, and is floundering waist deep in $100 billion worth of debt--the highest debt held by any oil company.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "UK newspaper Guardian will not accept advertising money from the fossil fuel industry, even if this means a financial hit for the media, making it the world's first large news organization to ban oil and gas adds.The Guardian has been active in recent years in covering climate change and reporting on the climate crisis. Last year, the Guardian changed its style guide to use stronger language to describe the climate emergency, using words such as 'climate crisis' and 'climate emergency' instead of 'climate change.'Now the Guardian is outright banning advertising money from oil and gas companies, with immediate effect, the newspaper said on Wednesday.\"Our decision is based on the decades-long efforts by many in that industry to prevent meaningful climate action by governments around the world,\" the company's acting chief executive, Anna Bateson, and the chief revenue officer, Hamish Nicklin, said in a joint statement.The Guardian has also recently pledged to become a carbon neutral organization at a corporate level by 2030, and to almost entirely divest its Scott Trust endowment fund from fossil fuels.  Guardian Media Group (GMG) generates 40 percent of its revenue from advertising, so rejecting ads from oil and gas companies would be a financial hit to the organization, the managers said.\"The funding model for the Guardian - like most high-quality media companies - is going to remain precarious over the next few years. It's true that rejecting some adverts might make our lives a tiny bit tougher in the very short term. Nonetheless, we believe building a more purposeful organisation and remaining financially sustainable have to go hand in hand,\" Bateson and Nicklin said.  Greenpeace UK welcomed Guardian's move, saying that \"This is a huge moment in the battle against oil and gas for all of us! Guardian have just announced they won't let dirty oil and gas companies advertise with them anymore because we're in a climate emergency.\" The environmental organization called on other media to follow suit because \"Dirty oil and gas companies are making the climate emergency worse.

        "content": "A key witness for the prosecution back peddled on Wednesday on previous testimony that he had seen evidence that oil majors Eni and Shell were involved in bribery over an oil deal in Nigeria, in the latest twist in the trial against the two oil companies in an Italian court.Eni and Shell are on trial in Italy for knowing that an alleged payment of US$1.3 billion in bribes was made to the former Nigerian government back in 2011, for which Eni and Royal Dutch Shell secured exclusive rights to develop the now infamous oil block OPL-245 offshore Nigeria.  The 2011 acquisition of block OPL 245, according to Italian and Nigerian prosecutors, involved a transfer of money to personal accounts held by the Nigerian oil minister at the time.  The sum of the OPL 245 deal was US$1.3 billion, an investigation revealed, of which US$1.1 billion was used to bribe politicians and businessmen to secure the deal. Shell and Eni have always insisted that at the time, they were unaware of any wrongdoing.Eni and Shell were ordered to stand trial in Milan under the Italian legislation that mandates companies be liable for crimes committed by directors and executives when a suspected unlawful conduct has benefited the legal entity.Related: The Fight For Venezuela's Oil Is Heating UpAccording to Bloomberg, Isaac Eke, a former high-ranking police officer in Nigeria, told the court on Wednesday that he could not corroborate an earlier testimony in a letter he sent to the court that he had shown photos of cash being taken to a private jet. Former Eni manager Vincenzo Armanna has claimed that a bodyguard, who was said to be Eke, at a villa of the Nigerian president at the time, Goodluck Jonathan, had shown him those photos.But during his testimony in the Milan court today, Eke said that he hadn't met Armanna until 2014, three years after the alleged events in 2011. Eke also said he had never set foot in the villa.Eke was one of the key witnesses for the prosecution, and his backtracking on the testimony could help the defense teams of the two oil majors.The trial in Milan is now entering its final stages, but other lawsuits are pending elsewhere over the same Nigerian oil deal. Shell, for one, faces prosecution from the Dutch authorities over the acquisition of block OPL 245. By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Due to the U.S. sanctions on Iran, Tehran is unable to use or transfer US$5 billion in revenues it has received from Iraq for supplying natural gas and electricity to its neighbor, an Iranian official told local media on Wednesday.Even after the U.S. slapped sanctions on Iran's energy exports, Iraq continues to import natural gas and electricity from Iran under a special waiver that the United States has regularly extended to Iraq.  Major Iraqi power plants are dependent on Iranian natural gas supply, and Iraq also imports electricity from Iran, as Baghdad's power generation is not enough to ensure domestic supply.  Despite the U.S. waiver for energy trade between Iran and Iraq, Iran is unable to use the money Iraq has paid in Iraqi dinars for the energy it imports from Iran.Up to $5 billion sits in an escrow account at the central bank of Iraq, but Iran cannot touch it because of the U.S. sanctions, Hamid Hosseini, a spokesman for Iranian Oil, Gas and Petrochemical Products Exporters' Association (OPEX) told Iranian news outlet Press-TV on Wednesday. Iran has been cut off from the global SWIFT payment system, and because of this, it hasn't found a way yet to have the money transferred, according to Press-TV.The situation highlights how the U.S. sanctions are crippling Iranian revenues and how Iran cannot access money from its energy exports even if those exports are allowed under the U.S. sanctions.Iraq, for its part, may have serious problems in securing its energy needs if the United States doesn't extend a waiver for an Iraqi bank to process payments for Iraq's imports of electricity and natural gas from Iran, the head of the Iraqi bank told AFP last week.  The waiver for the Iraqi bank handling the payments to Iran in Iraqi dinars expires next month. If the U.S. doesn't extend the waiver, the bank--Trade Bank of Iraq (TBI)--will stop processing payments, the head of the bank Faisal al-Haimus told AFP last week.

        "title": "GM To Spend $2.2 Billion On Electric Vehicle Production In Detroit",
        "content": "It isn't often that Detroit gets a multi-million-dollar reprieve, but this is the auto revolution 2.0, and there is some hope yet for the Motor City, with General Motors unveiling plans to spend $2.2 billion to produce autonomous and electric vehicles at its Detroit Hamtramck plant, recently on the brink of closing down entirely.The announcement came just a week after GM's Cruise subsidiary unveiled Origin, its first self-driving car without a steering wheel or pedals.In addition to the Origin, the facility will also produce all-electric SUVs and pickup trucks. GM plans to release 20 electric vehicles by 2023, the first of which will be an electric truck slated to go into production in 2021. The production is expected to include a Hummer pickup under the GMC brand.The fact is that GM is lagging behind its competitors, particularly in the luxury EV market. The company hasn't released a new electric vehicle since the Chevy Bolt nearly four years ago. Yet, over the last year, Audi, Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar, and BMW have all introduced high-end electric vehicles.With that in mind, GM plans to turn Cadillac into its leading EV brand to go all electric by 2030 in hopes that this will enable it to catch up with the others. Detroit-Hamtramck currently employs about 900 people and was slated for shutdown last summer until the company changed course after discussions with the union. The factory will still be shut down at the end of next month, when renovations are set to start. The plant will have 2,000 employees once it is at full capacity.In December, also in line with plans to play catchup, GM announced a joint venture with LG Chem to mass-produce batteries for electric cars. Two companies are planning to invest a total of $2.3 billion to build a new facility in Lordstown, Ohio. The factory will supply cells to vehicles made at the Detroit plant.GM noted that the recent support received from the state of Michigan was a key factor for the new $2.2-billion investment decision. The announcement came just a few days after the Michigan Strategic Fund agreed to revise tax breaks for GM in exchange for the company's commitment to invest at least $3.5 billion more over 10 years in the state.\"This investment helps ensure that Michigan will remain at the epicenter of the global automotive industry as we continue our journey to an electrified future,\" GM president Mark Reuss said in a statement. Related: Traders Increase Short Interest In Big Oil StocksEarlier this month, GM reported that its customer deliveries for the fourth quarter of 2019 declined 6.3 percent from year, due to the 40-day United Auto Workers (UAW) work stoppage. Back in 2018, GM announced plans to cut up to 14,000 jobs, close five factories by the end of last year and shift the company's workforce and lineup to build more electric and autonomous vehicles. The strike was negotiating a new labor contract that could save some of those factories from closing down and preserving the jobs in the state.The UAW expects the move away from gas engines could cut 35,000 jobs over the next several years, according to a research study conducted by the union last year. As a result of GM and UAW deal, some factories and jobs will be saved, but there is still room for GM to layoff quite a few workers.The Michigan Strategic Fund agreement requires GM to maintain 34,750 employees in Michigan in order to receive 100% credit for the remaining credit term. GM currently has 48,000 employees in the state. By Tom Kool for Safehaven.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "According to new research by the National Grid, in total the UK will need to fill 400,000 jobs by 2050 to ensure it makes the transition successfully.The total number combines both jobs which will need to be created, which number 260,000, whilst 140,000 will be to replace those who have left the workforce.Over 100,000 of the jobs will become available in the north of England, whilst 48,000 new roles will need filling in Scotland, which for its part, is on track to becoming a world renewables leader by 2030.In the next decade, 65,000 roles will be available for data analysts to forecast energy demand and engineers with expertise in renewables.The remaining 52,000 will be needed to replace workers set to leave the sector, as 20 per cent of the current energy sector workforce is set to retire by 2030.Nicola Shaw CBE, executive director of National Grid, said: \"Britain reached a major milestone last year as we saw zero carbon electricity outstrip fossil fuels for the first time. But there's still a long way to go. As the pathway to net zero becomes clearer, so must our understanding of the jobs and skills we need to succeed. \"Our research shows that to deliver net zero, the energy industry needs to recruit hundreds of thousands of people over the next thirty years - and that really is the tip of the iceberg in terms of the wider impact of net zero across other industries.\"Business minister Kwasi Kwarteng, said: \"Tackling climate change is not only saving the planet, but is significantly boosting our economy.\"As we work to reduce our emissions to net zero by 2050, the UK has the potential to support two million green-collar jobs across our world-class renewables sector, among other industries.\"According to industry body Energy UK, around 144,000 people are currently directly employed by the sector.Making the transition to net zero by 2050 will involve a wholesale recalibration of the UK's energy infrastructure, from increased electricity generation to low carbon heating systems and installing some 60,000 EV charging points.National Grid, which partnered with Development Economics on the paper, said that in order to fill the roles available the sector will have to tackle challenges such as the loss of talent due to retirement and a limited pipeline of young people with STEM qualifications.Despite the lofty challenges ahead, the UK is already making significant progress in its clean energy ambitions, with renewable electricity generation outpacing fossil fuels for the first time ever.By City AMMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Russian oil pipeline operator and owner, Transneft, which supplies Urals crude to European customers via the Druzhba pipeline, faces compensation claims of up to US$1 billion for the contaminated oil it sent to Europe last year, sources from oil firms, traders, and the industry told Reuters on Thursday.  At the end of April 2019, Russia halted supplies via the Druzhba oil pipeline to several European countries--including Germany, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, and the Czech Republic--due to a contamination issue, which the Russians said was deliberate.    Russia said at the time that the oil was contaminated with organic chlorine, a substance used in oil production to boost output but dangerous in high amounts for refining equipment. The amounts of the chemical were found to be at levels much higher than the maximum allowable amount.  A month after the crisis started, supplies were not restored and analysts and traders were saying the progress in restarting oil flows was very slow while costs could be very high, despite Russia's assurances that clean oil would resume flowing through the Druzhba pipeline westward to Europe in the second half of May. Supplies were restored only in early July, while Russia continues its investigation into how exactly the oil was contaminated.Meanwhile, Transneft now faces claims of a total of up to US$1 billion, more than double the US$364 million (23 billion Russian rubles) the company has allocated for paying compensations, according to multiple Reuters sources.  As per the sources, the average claims stand at US$30-US$40 a barrel, while Transneft has said it would pay up to US$15 per barrel.Related: The Real Reason Russia Wants A Ceasefire In LibyaA spokesman for Eni confirmed to Reuters that the Italian oil major had filed its claim for compensation over the tainted oil issue, but did not provide financial details due to commercial reasons.Poland's refiner PKN ORLEN said in December 2019 that it would seek compensation for the interrupted Russian supply and for the contamination issue.\"We are determined to recover all the costs we had to pay,\" Daniel Obajtek, CEO and President of the PKN ORLEN Management Board, said in a statement.

        "title": "Enbridge's Struggle To Change Terms On Canada's Largest Crude Oil Pipeline",
        "content": "Enbridge, which wants to change the contract terms on the largest Canadian oil pipeline network, believes that Canadian producers who have opposed that change may want to stall a review of the proposal in the hope that the fate of the other pipelines in the works could become clearer soon, a senior Enbridge executive told Bloomberg.  Enbridge operates Mainline, the largest pipeline network that sends Canadian crude oil to the United States with capacity of 2.85 million barrels per day (bpd).  In December, Enbridge filed an application to the Canada Energy Regulator (CER), proposing a new framework on the way crude volumes are being contracted and shipped via the Mainline pipeline. Currently, Enbridge allocates capacity on the Mainline on an uncommitted basis, using a monthly nomination system. But the pipeline company wants to change that allocation system by contracting 90 percent of the capacity under long-term contracts, leaving only 10 percent for uncommitted or spot shipments.Enbridge argues that the new system will ensure non-discriminatory and open-access to capacity, improve takeaway capacity out of Western Canada, and support Western Canadian oil prices.\"Shippers representing approximately 70 per cent of the Mainline's current throughput support our approach,\" Guy Jarvis, Enbridge Executive Vice President, Liquids Pipelines, said in December when Enbridge filed its application.But several oil producers, including the largest, Canadian Natural Resources, oppose the move and asked this week the CER to split the review process into two parts, the first being the fundamental question if Enbridge should be allowed to convert access to the pipeline to long-term contracting.Related: Exxon's Earnings Slump On Poor Petrochemical, Refining ResultsAsked to comment on the opposition from some producers, Enbridge's Yu told Bloomberg:\"It might be strategic from some of these shippers because it would help them gain more clarity on what's happening on some of the other pipelines that are under development.\"  Canadian oil producers have been struggling with insufficient pipeline takeaway capacity in recent years. As a consequence, producers have been suffering from depressed Western Canadian oil prices while Line 3, the Trans Mountain Expansion, and Keystone XL are months and even years away from start of operations. That is, if they clear all legal and regulatory hurdles, which opponents of the pipelines have filed in courts over the past few years.

        "content": "Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) posted a fourth-quarter loss of $6.6 billion versus earnings of $3.7 billion for the same period of 2018, on the back of massive write-offs of $10.4 billion predominantly in its U.S. shale gas assets.  Chevron's quarterly loss, which was the steepest in a decade, did not surprise analysts and Wall Street because the U.S. supermajor had already announced the write-off and impairment charges a month and a half ago. The write-offs were mostly attributed to the continuously depressed U.S. natural gas prices.  However, Chevron's total earnings per share excluding special items--the write-offs--and foreign currency effects, slightly beat analyst expectations.Total per-share earnings excluding special items and FX effects stood at $1.49 in the fourth quarter of 2019, down from EPS of $1.95 in 2018, but above analyst estimates of $1.47 compiled by the Wall Street Journal.Total revenues, however, missed analyst expectations. Chevron's revenues in the fourth quarter of 2019 slipped to $36.35 billion, from $42.352 billion in the year-ago period, and were below the $38.639 billion revenues expected by Refinitiv.Cash flow from operations in 2019 fell to $27.3 billion from $30.6 billion in 2018.  On the production side, Chevron achieved record annual net oil-equivalent production of 3.06 million barrels per day, with Chevron's CEO Michael Wirth commenting that \"for the first time in the company's history, annual production exceeded 3 million barrels per day of oil equivalent.\"In the fourth quarter, unconventional net oil-equivalent production in the Permian Basin stood at 514,000 barrels per day, representing growth of 36 percent compared to a year ago, Chevron said.In the downstream, Chevron's Q4 earnings grew in the United States thanks to higher margins on refined product sales and lower operating expenses. Internationally, Chevron's downstream earnings declined to $184 million in Q4 2019, from $603 million a year earlier, largely due to lower margins on refined product sales.After the results release, Chevron's shares slumped at market opening and were down nearly 3 percent at 09:45 a.m. EDT.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

The bottom line is that it is not true. I maintain that it is not true,\" Chitando told the Zimbabwe Independent.The potential deal, reportedly worth US$1.4 billion, would see Russia's Tatneft ship in fuel to Zimbabwe via the Port of Beira in Mozambique, according to the Zimbabwe Independent.Last week, Tatneft's general director Nail Maganov told Russia's news agency Interfax that Tatneft was indeed working on an agreement to supply fuel to Zimbabwe as part of a fuel-for-diamonds deal.\"We are working on this issue. I want to say that this is a real thing... I know that the fuel supply is real,\" Maganov told Interfax on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos last week.Previous reports had it that Russia's diamond mining giant Alrosa would also be involved in the deal.Alrosa is not part of this fuel for diamonds scheme, Alrosa's press service told Interfax last week. Zimbabwe is looking at alternatives to buying fuel amid a raging economic crisis and hyperinflation, where fuel, food, basic commodities, and necessities are scarce, while a currency shortage doesn't allow the authorities to buy fuel on the free market.Zimbabwe also faces a hunger crisis due to drought, the World Food Programme (WFP) said in December.

Adding the loss of daily gas production, NOC said, Mellitah is incurring losses of $9.4 million in revenues on a daily basis.Earlier this week, NOC's Mustafa Sanalla warned that Libyan oil production could stop completely if the blockade continued.A group of paramilitary formations affiliated with General Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Army occupied the export terminals last week along with pipelines and fields. The blockade came amid continued fighting between the LNA, which is loyal to the eastern Libyan government and the forces loyal to the Government of National Accord, which is recognized by the United Nations.NOC declared force majeure on the oil terminals, with production losses at the time estimated to reach between 500,000 and 800,000 bpd. That's down from over 1.2 million bpd that Libya was producing before the LNA blockade. However, by Tuesday, production had dropped to just 300,000 bpd with Sanalla telling Bloomberg it could drop further to just 72,000 bpd.Eni, which stayed in Libya throughout the ordeal that followed the removal of Muammar Ghadaffi in 2011, accounts for as much as 45 percent of the country's oil and gas production. Libyan operations contribute 15 percent of the company's global total output. According to Energy Voice, the Mellitah oil and gas complex is currently outside of the LNA's control, but the group is trying to expand its presence in the area.Eni is seeking to expand its presence in Libya as well. Last year, the Italian major said it was going to restart an exploration program with BP, but later decided to postpone the restart because of the deterioration in the security situation in the North African country.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "The United States will remove the sanctions it imposed on Chinese tanker operator Cosco for violating the Iran oil sanctions, Reuters reports, citing sources in the know.One of the sources, from a large Chinese oil company, said Cosco had already been taken off the sanction list and only an official confirmation of the removal was pending. The other source said Washington had given indication it was about to lift the sanctions.Washington imposed sanctions on several Chinese tanker operators last September, alleging that they continued to transport Iranian oil in violation of the sanctions that the U.S. Department of Treasury imposed on Tehran earlier that year.\"We are imposing sanctions on certain Chinese firms for knowingly engaging in a significant transaction for the transport of oil from Iran, including knowledge of sanctionable conduct, contrary to U.S. sanctions,\" U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in September 2019, adding in a tweet that \"We will take action on any sanctionable Iranian oil transaction.\"As a result of the sanctions on the Chinese tanker operators, 25 Very large Crude Carriers operated by a regional unit of Cosco in Dalian went out of service, and shipping rates for oil cargoes around the world shot up. This ended up disrupting shipping markets because it remained unclear for a while whether the sanctions only concerned Cosco's Dalian tanker unit, which operates some 40 vessels, according to Reuters, or the whole shipping company with a fleet of more than 1,000 vessels.Now, if the removal of the sanctions on Cosco is confirmed, this will lead to a plunge in freight rates, which makes it bad news for shipper but good news for the oil industry.In the meantime, China has continued to import Iranian oil, customs data has shown. The latest from the Chinese customs authority revealed the country imported close to 300,000 bpd of Iranian oil last year. Imports could actually be even higher, with the rest coming from ship-to-ship transfers at sea.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "title": "Coronavirus Halts Flow Of Latin American Oil To China",
        "content": "The flow of oil traveling from Latin America to China has stopped in the wake of the deadly outbreak of the coronavirus that has sunk oil prices to three-month lows, with no oil making its way from Brazil or Colombia to China since last week, according to Bloomberg. Chinese refineries are responsible for taking one-third of all oil from Brazil, Colombia, and other Latin American countries.The demand for jet fuel and gasoline stemming from travel restrictions that have been put in place in an effort to stop the virus from spreading is expected to fall sharply, which will inevitably catch up to the refineries who are expected to cut back production at some point. Brazil is the main Latin American supplier of crude oil to China--particularly to the independent refiners known as teapots, who are most exposed to the effects of reduced demand.According to Bloomberg, the death toll from the virus has climbed to 170, with more than 8,000 infected with the coronavirus in China.So much so is the fear surrounding the effect on oil demand and prices that OPEC announced yesterday that it is considering moving up its March meeting as the effects of the deadly coronavirus continues to exert strong downward pressure on oil prices.The cartel was said to already be discussing an extension of the current production cut agreement, and that all options were on the table.Even with Libya's oil production plummeting by nearly 1 million barrels per day (bpd) due to the port blockade by forces loyal to General Khalifa Haftar, oil prices have seen downward pressure over the past week and a half as fears of oil demand destruction currently outweigh supply outages.Earlier in the week, Petrobras said it had suspended all employee travel to China due to the virus, but was quick to add that shipments of oil to China would continue.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "title": "Canada's Oil Sands Investment To Rise For The First Time Since 2014",
        "content": "Upstream capital investment in Canada's oil sands is expected to grow this year from 2019 for the first increase in capital expenditures in five years, the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP) said on Thursday.The association attributed its rosier expectations for this year to \"a more competitive economic environment\" due to some recent policies that the Alberta government has undertaken. These are Alberta's government job creation tax cuts, the fact that energy firms now may produce more oil despite the industry-wide production cuts if those firms move the additional barrels by rail, and the permission to oil firms to drill new wells without being restricted by the current industry-wide production limits.Upstream investment in the oil sands is expected to grow to US$8.8 billion (C$11.6 billion) this year, up from an estimated US$8.1 billion (C$10.7 billion) in 2019, the industry's main lobby group said.Capital spending in the oil and natural gas industry in Canada is forecast to rise by around US$1.5 billion (C$2 billion) in 2020 compared to 2019, with capital investment on conventional projects rising by 4 percent, and capital investment in the oil sands rising by 8 percent, CAAP said.Conventional oil and natural gas capital investment is seen rising to US$19.2 billion (C$25.4 billion) this year, up from an estimated US$18.5 billion (C$24.4 billion) last year.  Related: Tesla Shares Race, But How Long Will The Rally Last?Canadian energy companies, which have had a tough couple of years, continue to believe that the long-term solution to Canada's oil industry's woes is the construction of major new pipelines to increase market access, and potentially, to tap new export markets outside the buyer of nearly all Canadian oil exports, the United States.\"In addition to more competitive fiscal policies in key provinces, oil producers are cautiously optimistic that additional pipeline capacity is on the way. With the Line 3 project scheduled to come on stream in late 2020, the Trans Mountain Expansion underway, and pre-construction activities ongoing for Keystone XL, there is potential for medium and long-term production growth with access to global markets and expanded transport capacity into the United States,\" CAPP said today.\"Investors are seeing some positive activity in the industry right now, and it's important that all levels of government show a commitment to Canada's energy industry and the hundreds of thousands of Canadians who work in the industry,\" said Tim McMillan, President and CEO of CAPP.

        "content": "The UK's oil and gas industry plans to become a net zero oil and gas basin in terms of own production emissions by 2050, as the UK North Sea operators support the government's commitment to cut greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050, Deirdre Michie, the chief executive of the OGUK industry association, said on Thursday.In June last year, the UK became the first major economy in the world to enshrine in a law its target to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050.Since then, the UK oil and gas industry, via its industry body OGUK, has pledged that it would work toward the UK and Scottish government goals to cut emissions and seize opportunities presented by the hydrogen economy and Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage (CCUS).Today, OGUK's chief executive Michie said in a speech in Edinburgh, Scotland, that the UK offshore oil and gas industry would aim to reduce its own emissions from 14 million tons today - currently 3 percent of the UK's total greenhouse gas emissions - to 0.5 mt by 2050, in line with the Climate Change Committee outlook.\"It will require significant investment, new technology and close working with the renewables sector in Scotland and across the UK,\" the CEO of the oil and gas industry association noted.  The second 'net zero commitment' of the industry body is to support the development of CCUS and other low carbon tech at scale, because CCUS would be required in all decarbonization scenarios.\"We are looking to work with governments and regulators to progress the five CCUS projects across the UK which now need to move at pace into the next phase,\" Michie said.Hydrogen is also an opportunity in the path toward net zero emissions, because it could become a \"potentially disruptive player in the clean energy mix,\" the oil and gas industry's association chief said.\"We are here and we want to help. And we want to be a positive force in this transition,\" said Michie. By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

After the sanctions on Cosco, the cost of chartering supertankers to carry crude oil from the Middle East to Asia soared by double digits overnight.On Friday, the U.S. partially lifted some of the sanctions on Cosco.  Now the freight rates for supertankers, the so-called very large crude carriers (VLCCs), are down to their lowest since the middle of September 2019 as Chinese refiners grapple with weakening fuel demand at home and elsewhere in Asia.  Demand for jet fuel, gasoline, and diesel is likely to be suppressed in the coming weeks as airlines are canceling thousands of flights to and from China, and Chinese authorities are discouraging or outright banning travel in the areas most affected by the virus.The flow of oil traveling from Latin America to China has stopped in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, with no oil making its way from Brazil or Colombia to China in more than a week, Bloomberg reported last week.Sinopec, the largest oil refiner in Asia, is cutting its refinery production by 600,000 bpd in February, due to decreased fuel demand amid the outbreak, while independent Chinese refiners have already cut run rates by as much as 30-50 percent and now operate at less than half of their refining capacity, sources familiar with the plans told Reuters on Monday.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

Most of the pre-January stock loss was due to extra crude shipments to India, who had previously stopped purchasing Venezuelan crude. Those shipments have since resumed.The oil-glut reduction bodes well for Venezuela, which was choking on its own oil with exports stifled by US sanctions.Venezuela's situation is still dire. Its oil exports slid in 2019 by one-third, according to Reuters, averaging a million barrels per day for the year, as the US attempted to squeeze the country's finances to encourage the removal of socialist leader Nicolas Maduro. Maduro has managed to hang onto power, however, but not without great cost.Venezuela's oil problems began well before the US sanctions, with oil production falling from an average of 2.319 million bpd in 2015, to just 714,000 bpd in December 2019, due to mismanagement and corruption.Venezuela's main outlets for its crude oil consist now mainly of India, China, Russia, and Cuba.Last year, Venezuela PDVSA announced plans to boost its oil production for this year to 1.2 million bpd--an increase of roughly a half a million barrels per day. The plan, however, lacked specificity.

The EIA's estimates, however, were for a build of 3.5-million barrels for that week.Oil prices were down in the afternoon hours, after trending upward earlier in the day on news that OPEC was in talks about what action to take in response to the effects of the coronavirus that have disrupted travel within China and consequently, oil demand.At 3:39 pm EST on Tuesday the WTI benchmark was trading down $0.23 (-0.46%) at $49.88--more than $3 down compared to last week's levels.

        "content": "ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP) reported on Tuesday lower-than-forecast Q4 earnings on the back of lower oil and gas prices, but the Houston-based energy producer also announced a $10-billion increase in its share buyback program.  ConocoPhillips' Q4 adjusted earnings came in at $831 million, or $0.76 per share, down from adjusted earnings of $1.3 billion, or $1.13 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2018.  The Q4 2019 earnings per share fell short of the analyst consensus of $0.80 per share of the Wall Street Journal.  ConocoPhillips attributed the lower adjusted earnings in Q4 to lower realized prices and volumes. The company's total realized price was $47.01 per barrel of oil equivalent (boe) in Q4 2019, down by 11 percent from the $53.00 per boe price realized in the fourth quarter of 2018, reflecting lower market prices. Apart from the lower prices, Q4 earnings were impacted by a non-cash impairment related to a pending sale in Niobrara, ConocoPhillips said.Full-year adjusted earnings also dropped, to $4.0 billion for 2019 from adjusted earnings of $5.3 billion for 2018.Full-year production from the Lower 48 'Big 3'--the Permian, the Eagle Ford, and the Bakken as ConocoPhillips calls those shale regions collectively--increased by 22 percent.Adjusting for closed sales and acquisitions, ConocoPhillips' underlying total production in 2019 rose by 59,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, chiefly due to growth from the Big 3, development programs and major projects in Alaska, Europe, and Asia Pacific.  Despite the weaker prices and weaker earnings compared to 2018, ConocoPhillips generated last year $11.7 billion in cash from operations (CFO), which exceeded the total of $6.6 billion in capital expenditure and investments, $3.5 billion in share repurchases, and $1.5 billion in dividends.Along with the 2019 financials, ConocoPhillips announced on Tuesday that its board of directors had voted to increase the company's existing share buyback by $10 billion to bring it to a total of $25 billion. Since it approved the share repurchase program in late 2016, ConocoPhillips had bought back $9.6 billion in shares through 2019, while it plans $3 billion in share repurchases this year.

        "content": "UK supermajor BP (NYSE: BP) snapped on Tuesday a streak of gloomy earnings for Big Oil, reporting profit-beating expectations, raising its dividend, and more than doubling its U.S. shale production after buying BHP assets in America.BP's underlying replacement cost profit--the group's proxy for net profit--in the fourth quarter fell to $2.6 billion from $3.5 billion, mostly reflecting lower oil prices in the period, which also dragged down the earnings of the other supermajors that reported Q4 and 2019 financials last week.BP's full-year profit fell to $10.0 billion from $12.7 billion, \"largely reflecting the impact of the weaker environment,\", but the 2019 profit beat the analyst forecast of $9.7 billion, as per Refinitiv.BP also completed its share buyback program in January, 2020, and said today it is raising fourth-quarter dividend by 2.4 percent year on year to 10.5 cents per share.Full-year results mainly reflected lower liquids and gas realizations due to lower prices and higher depreciation, partly offset by strong gas marketing and trading results and higher production, BP said in a statement.Thanks to the $10-billion acquisition of U.S. shale assets from BHP, BP's business in the Lower 48 states, BPX Energy, reported liquids production more than doubled to 124,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2019, up from 55,000 bpd in 2018. Capital expenditure jumped to $1.939 billion from $1.146 billion, while the average number of BPX-operated rigs was 13 rigs last year, up from 9 rigs in 2018.Retiring Group chief executive Bob Dudley, who leaves the post to Bernard Looney and who saved BP from the brink after the Deepwater Horizon disaster, said: \"After almost ten years, this is now my last quarter as CEO. In that time, we have achieved a huge amount together and I am proud to be handing over a safer and stronger BP to Bernard and his team.\"\"BP is navigating a difficult course with some aplomb,\" Richard Hunter from Interactive Investor commented on the 2019 results.Despite the 9-percent slump in BP's shares in the past three months alone, and \"despite the difficulties, among the oil majors BP's performance was arguably the pick of the bunch,\" Hunter noted.Following the results release and dividend increase, BP's shares rallied more than 3 percent in London at noon local time, and were up more than 4 percent in pre-market in New York at 07:30 a.m. on Tuesday.

That was 14 percent more than Model 3 sales in 2018 and it constituted a solid portion of total EV sales, which stood at 2.2 million last year.The Model X and the Model S also recorded increases in sales last year, but a lot more modest, with Model X sales rising by 2 percent and Model S sales up by just 1 percent.

However, the watchdog claims, \"typical\" deals usually offer a much higher percentage to the host country, in the realm of 65%-85%.Global Witness claimed in its report that Guyana \"deserves\" a better deal. Guyana, the watchdog alleges, was in a position to negotiate a better deal following Exxon's initial discovery, but that the government's \"inexperienced\" bureaucrats failed to push as hard as they could.Exxon continues to mention it has continued to operate within the law, both in negotiating the deal and in all aspects of doing business in Guyana.Exxon has had a particularly rough week, reporting on Friday a 5% earnings slump to $5.69 billion, with earnings per common share falling 6% to $1.33. Exxon's full-year earnings fell 31%. The grim quarterly results caused Goldman Sachs to downgrade Exxon to \"sell\", causing the stock to fall 2.38% to $60.64 per share--from $64.79 on January 30, and from over $70 this time last year.While its upstream segment and the cash from the sale of its Norway upstream business helped Exxon to weather the weaker crude oil and natural gas prices of 2019, its chemicals and downstream businesses didn't perform well last quarter.\"Industry fuels margins were significantly lower than third quarter, reflecting seasonally lower demand and increased supply from reduced industry maintenance,\" Exxon said, while it also flagged further weakening of chemicals margins from already depressed levels.Despite the brutal Q4, Exxon continues to announce find after find in offshore Guyana. Its latest announcement increased its estimate of recoverable resources there by another 2 billion barrels of oil equivalent, to 8 billion boe.

It is Japan's lifeline,\" Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told the crew of the destroyer Takanami prior to departure.The destroyer will head to the Gulf of Oman, and will patrol there as well as in the northern Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Aden. It will not, however, patrol the Strait of Hormuz--the world's most critical and risky oil chokepoint in the world, after Iran repeatedly threatened to close the Strait and hijacked oil tankers in the Strait last year.Japan is acting to protect its oil interests in the region, but it is also being cautious. Japan has a fairly stable relationship with Iran and has strong ties to the United States and other allies who are also patrolling the area. Japan will not collaborate with these allies, nor does it seek to provoke Iran by its presence in the area.Japan's oil tanker the Kokuka Courageous was attacked in June in the Gulf of Oman near the Strait of Hormuz. Japan condemned the attack on its tanker, but while the US blamed the incident on Iran, Japan stopped short of doing so.

China's independent refiners were expected to cut refinery throughput more significantly because they are not allowed to export fuels, unlike the state-held corporations.   Independent refiners in China's Shandong province in the east have already cut refinery runs by as much as 30-50 percent and are now said to operate at less than half of their refining capacity, according to Reuters' sources.Sinopec, for its part, is cutting 600,000 bpd of fuel production this month alone, which represents 12 percent of the corporation's 5-million-bpd average fuel production for last year, Reuters sources say.Sinopec told Reuters in a statement that it was carefully monitoring market demand and would optimize its run rates and fuel product mix based on that demand, avoiding to directly refer to refinery production reductions.Analysts continue to struggle to peg the exact demand loss from the coronavirus, but they agree that there would be some demand destruction in China, in the first quarter at least.Wood Mackenzie estimates that China's oil demand will be reduced by 250,000 bpd in the first quarter of 2020.The sudden demand shock from the coronavirus will make OPEC and Russia's efforts to balance the market and support oil prices even more difficult.The OPEC+ allies are said to be considering deepening the cuts by another 500,000 bpd, due to the oil demand destroyed by the coronavirus, OPEC and industry sources told Reuters on Monday.

        "content": "The United States stands ready to help Brazil to improve the rules for bidding in its oil auctions in order to make them more attractive to international oil majors, U.S. Secretary of Energy Dan Brouillette said on Sunday during a visit to Brazil.\"And we stand ready to assist, should it be desired or needed, to help design new auctions that might produce results that are more conducive to the desires of the Brazilian government,\" Brouillette told reporters, as carried by Reuters.At the end of last year, Brazil held three separate oil auctions for what it said were very attractive and prolific offshore areas. The auctions, however, failed to excite as much interest as the Brazilian government had hoped, while analysts deemed those auctions failures.  Last year's final oil auction in Brazil ended in a flop, with Big Oil staying away from bidding and only one of five blocks awarded, suggesting that the massive upfront payments and complex royalty schemes have kept the world's largest oil companies from participating. The underwhelming results of the final oil auction for the year came a day after another near-flop in the biggest oil auction ever held in Brazil, in which Big Oil didn't bid and Petrobras picked up two of the four blocks on offer.Speaking in Rio de Janeiro on Sunday, Secretary Brouillette said, as carried by Reuters:\"We looked at what happened in the last auction, with regard to the blocks. We understand, I think clearly, why some investors may have shied away from that.\"Big Oil will likely snub Brazil's huge oil auctions in 2020, just as they did in last year's highly anticipated bid rounds, because projects and prospects around the world are competing for the majors' disciplined capital spending, the head of BP in Brazil said last November. Assets in other countries will be more attractive than Brazil's resources, BP Energy Brazil's president Adriano Bastos told local economic daily Valor Economico back then.

        "content": "The OPEC+ joint technical committee asked China on Tuesday to help it assess the demand loss from the coronavirus outbreak, as OPEC and its allies are struggling to contain an oil market meltdown over the virus.With oil prices falling into a bear market earlier this week, having dropped by more than 20 percent since a high in January, delegates from OPEC+ countries gathered in Vienna on Tuesday to discuss in an emergency meeting how the cartel and its allies should respond to the fast drop in prices.The OPEC+ panel invited Wang Qun, China's ambassador to international organizations in Vienna, to attend a closed-door meeting to helps assess the demand destruction. According to OPEC officials who spoke to Bloomberg, Wang told the committee delegates that China expects the virus impact would be localized and limited, and warned against overreaction.   As of early Wednesday, the coronavirus had already claimed 492 lives worldwide, mostly in China, and had infected more than 24,500 people in 25 countries. China's oil demand amid the coronavirus outbreak is likely inflicting the worst oil demand shock to markets since the financial crisis of 2008-2009 and refiners are cutting refinery runs amid weak fuel demand.The OPEC+ panel did not discuss cuts on Tuesday, but it continues the meeting on Wednesday. The meeting, according to Bloomberg's sources, showed the usual power play seen at all OPEC+ meetings so far--OPEC's largest producer Saudi Arabia pushing for more cuts, while Russia--the leader of the non-OPEC group of producers part of the deal--pushing back.The Saudis are pushing for an additional cut of at least 500,000 bpd and even 1 million bpd, delegates told Bloomberg.Meanwhile, Russia's Energy Minister Alexander Novak told reporters in Russia on Tuesday that Russia was ready to move up the March OPEC+ meeting to February, but added that only a careful assessment of demand drop would inform the coalition whether further cuts are needed.OPEC's own analysis at the panel meeting showed a 400,000-bpd drop in global oil demand growth over six months, delegates at the Tuesday meeting told Bloomberg.Commenting on the need of additional cuts, ING strategists said on Wednesday:  \"If we assume that OPEC numbers are correct, and then factor in the supply losses we are seeing from Libya at the moment, and assume that these last through until the end of Q1, 500Mbbls/d of additional cuts should be almost enough to balance the market over Q1, whilst over Q2 we would likely need to see current cuts of 1.7MMbbls/d rolled over through until at least the end of June.\"  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

The current whereabouts of the six oil executives are unknown, Alirio Zambrano, the brother of two of them, told AP.The six U.S. executives at Citgo, the U.S. subsidiary of Venezuela's state-held oil firm PDVSA, were detained by Nicolas Maduro's regime in Venezuela in November 2017 and the 'Citgo 6' sat in jail two years after their detention.Venezuela arrested the six executives as part of a corruption sweep at an event in Caracas in November 2017. Maduro said a week later that all six - five of whom are US citizens and one holding a permanent residency permit for the United States - would be tried as traitors.Back then, U.S. authorities requested that its nationals be released, but Maduro refused, saying \"These are people born in Venezuela, they're Venezuelan and they're going to be judged for being corrupt, thieving traitors.\"Last December, Venezuela released the six Citgo executives under house arrest.The executives were only brought to court in the middle of 2019, after 18 months in prison. During that hearing, the presiding judge accepted the prosecution's request for a trial on corruption charges without setting a date.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Norway's Equinor (NYSE: EQNR) reported on Thursday better-than-forecast earnings for the fourth quarter, as the start-up of the massive Johan Sverdrup oilfield partially offset lower oil and gas prices.Similarly to other oil majors, Equinor's profit in Q4 declined from a year earlier, but the drop was less than a consensus estimate had expected.Equinor reported adjusted earnings at $3.55 billion for the fourth quarter, down from $4.39 billion for the same period in 2018, but higher than the $3.37-billion consensus of 25 equity analysts whose input Equinor had collected.  The October start-up of the North Sea oilfield Johan Sverdrup, which currently produces 350,000 bpd, boosted Equinor's production to a record high in Q4, the Norwegian giant said today.\"We expect the entire phase 1 investment to be paid back already by the end of this year, less than 15 months after the first well was put in production,\" Equinor's president and CEO Eldar Saetre said, commenting on the Johan Sverdrup development.Alongside its Q4 and full-year results, Equinor updated the market on its goals going forward and unveiled a plan to significantly cut emissions, not only from its oil and gas production, but also from the products it sells, joining other majors such as Shell, which has set short-term targets for reducing the net carbon footprint of the energy products it sells.Related: Guyana's Economic Growth Jumps As Oil Production SoarsEquinor expects around 7-percent production growth this year and average annual production growth of around 3 percent from 2019 to 2026.  In its plan to cut carbon intensity, Equinor looks to reduce the net carbon intensity, from initial production to final consumption, of energy produced by at least 50 percent by 2050. The firm--which dropped Statoil as its name aiming to be associated more with a 'broad energy company'--also plans to grow profitably within its renewables business and become a global offshore wind major. Equinor targets to grow its renewable energy capacity tenfold by 2026, when it expects production capacity from renewable projects of 4 GW to 6 GW. By 2035, Equinor expects to further boost its installed renewables capacity, to 12 GW-16 GW.\"We are developing as a broad energy company, leveraging the strong synergies between oil, gas, renewables, CCUS and hydrogen,\" Saetre said.

        "content": "While a technical panel of the OPEC+ coalition is recommending an additional cut of 600,000 bpd in response to the lower oil demand due to the coronavirus outbreak, OPEC's key ally in the deal, Russia, continues to be a holdout on the need to cut deeper to counter the oil price slide.After three days of discussions of the OPEC+ Joint Technical Committee (JTC) in Vienna, the panel is reportedly recommending a deeper cut, of 600,000 bpd.But Russia, which has sent delegates to the committee's meeting, has been uncertain about further cuts all week, and is now asking for more time to have the top officials at home review the recommendation and the market situation, delegates told media on Thursday.Russia's Energy Minister Alexander Novak reiterated in Moscow today that it is too early to talk about any decision that should be taken as part of the OPEC+ deal.Russia has been reluctant to commit to cuts in all of the previous OPEC+ meetings, before agreeing to play ball in the eleventh hour.The current consultations and discussions don't look too different from previous such 'rifts' between Russia and OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia, which is pushing for deeper cuts as oil prices are now below the Kingdom's comfort range and much lower than $80-plus a barrel Brent it needs to balance its budget this year.Russia is not so desperate to see oil prices so high--it has consistently budgeted for lower oil prices than the actual ones since the 2014 price collapse, and as a result is much more resilient to price drops than Saudi Arabia.Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Russia's Novak said he is not ready to say whether Russia is ready or not to agree to deeper cuts, because the situation on the market is still unclear.It will take more time to have a clearer view on the impact of the coronavirus on the global oil market, Novak said.

        "content": "Brazilian lender BNDES sold a stake in Petrobras for $5.2 billion, Reuters reports, and plans to pay part of the proceeds as dividends to the Brazilian Treasury.The sale followed a secondary offering of shares by Petrobras, announced in January. The offering, of almost 612 million shares, was expected to raise $4.62 billion (19.6 billion reias) for the oil major, with the development bank allowed to sell another 122.37 million shares worth some $920 million. This, according to the securities filing from January, could see BNDES raise up to $5.54 billion.This is the biggest share sale that Petrobras has organized since 2010, Bloomberg noted in a report on the offering announcement, and the company is much more attractive for investors right now. The company broke its oil production record last year, pumping more than a billion barrels for the first time in its history.Brazil's crude oil production topped 3 million barrels per day for the first time ever in November 2019, the ANP reported last month, adding that total oil and gas production rose to 3.95 million barrels of oil equivalent daily - also a record-breaking figure.Petrobras is also doing a lot better financially. It has divested from a lot of non-core operations, has stopped subsidising low prices at the pump, and has doubled cash from operations.The company also recently agreed on a $9-billion payout from the Brazilian government that settled their dispute over the so-called transfer-of-rights area in the presalt zone that will finally allow Petrobras to proceed with developing the significant oil resources in that area.\"It's a very different moment for Petrobras,\" said a Brazilian asset manager as quoted by Bloomberg. \"Back then, the market was willing to write the company a blank check to invest billions of dollars in what was essentially a crapshoot. Today, we know the pre-salt is profitable and that exploration costs are among the most competitive in the world.

So, absolutely, that ... remains on the table,\" the official said. \"Whether it's Rosneft, whether it's Reliance, whether it's Repsol, whether it's Chevron here in the United States, I would tread cautiously towards their activities in Venezuela that are in support, directly or indirectly, of the Maduro dictatorship because ... we're halfway through our maximum pressure campaign.\"Reuters reports that some industry executives were surprised by the tone of the comments because in the last few months Washington has not made any threats or warnings to oil companies operating in Venezuela. In fact, it even extended Chevron's sanction exemption last month, allowing the company to continue operating in the country for three more months, until April 22.Chevron operates a joint venture with Venezuela's PDVSA in the country that is home to the world's most abundant oil resources. Petroboscan, the joint venture, produced around 200,000 bpd as of October, with Chevron's share of this at 34,000 bpd. The U.S. supermajor holds a 30-percent stake in the venture.Russia's Rosneft has four joint ventures with PDVSA that produce oil and it also became the largest receiver of Venezuelan crude last year: the Russian company sold the oil on behalf of PDVSA and kept the proceeds as payment on billions of dollars in loans to the embattled Venezuelan company.Yet even Chevron is selling PDVSA oil, Reuters reported last month. According to industry sources, this did not violate sanctions if the proceeds from the sales were used to pay down debt accrued by the joint ventures PDVSA operates with its foreign partners.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Canada's merchandise trade deficit narrowed more than expected in December, thanks to a rebound in crude oil exports in the last month of 2019 from the previous month, when a pipeline outage and a railway strike had crippled oil exports.In December 2019, Canada's merchandise trade deficit with the world narrowed to US$278 million (C$370 million) from US$903 million (C$1.2 billion) in November, mostly due to higher oil exports, Statistics Canada said on Wednesday.  The December deficit was one of the smallest deficits Canada has recorded in recent years, and was also lower than expectations, according to Bloomberg.Exports of energy products posted the largest monthly gain in December, at 9.5 percent, led by an 18-percent jump in crude oil exports, Statistics Canada said, noting that crude oil exports were low in November because of a nearly two-week outage of the Keystone oil pipeline.At the end of October, the Keystone pipeline was shut down in the wake of a spill of more than 9,000 barrels of oil in North Dakota.  \"As the situation was resolved before the end of November, crude oil exports rebounded strongly in December,\" Statistics Canada said today.  The eight-day strike at the end of November at Canadian National, the biggest railway in Canada, also sent shockwaves through the struggling oil industry, as crude-by-rail shipments from Alberta were nearly halted during the industrial action.  After dragging on for more than a week and threatening to erase billions of dollars from Canada's economy, the strike ended on November 26, after the Teamsters Canada trade union and Canadian National reached a tentative agreement to renew the collective agreement for more than 3,000 conductors, trainpersons, and yard workers.In December, Canada's exports to the United States increased by 2.9 percent, mainly due to the rebound in crude oil exports, according to Statistics Canada.

        "content": "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit will hear arguments on Wednesday whether to allow lawsuits against Big Oil by several California cities be heard in state court, as the communities want, instead of federal court, on which the oil corporations insist.  Should the appeals court decide in favor of the plaintiffs in two separate lawsuits to have oil corporations, including Exxon and Chevron, pay for damages caused by rising sea levels and other impacts from climate change, other American cities could file more lawsuits against oil firms demanding compensation and demanding those case be heard in state courts.The lawsuits, one filed by San Francisco and Oakland, and another by the city of Imperial Beach and several counties in California, argue that Exxon, Chevron, Shell, BP, and ConocoPhillips should be held liable for the impact on communities from climate change, including rising sea levels, heat waves, and wildfires.  Last year, San Francisco and Oakland approached a federal appeals court with a request to reinstate their lawsuits against the five Big Oil companies, which a U.S. District Judge had dismissed in 2018.Lawyers for San Francisco and Oakland will argue today that the case should be allowed at a state court, Los Angeles Times reports.If the judges were to rule in favor of the plaintiffs, courts are likely to start taking such lawsuits more seriously, law experts told Los Angeles Times. Moreover, allowing cases in a state court could impact cases filed in other states, Sean Hecht, co-executive director of the Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at UCLA School of Law, told the newspaper.\"A court hearing in California this week could have major implications for the fight to hold fossil fuel companies accountable for the costs of climate change,\" the Center for Climate Integrity, a group supporting local governments, said earlier this week.In October last year, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected requests by a number of oil companies to block three lawsuits launched against them by state and local governments for their role in climate change, in a blow to BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Exxon, Shell, and Phillips 66, which had requested that the cases filed in Maryland, Rhode Island, and Colorado, be moved to federal court.

Two industry executives this week argues that the low gas prices in the United States could actually be beneficial for more LNG exports.\"There's massive demand for LNG. It's growing extremely well and we think that will continue for a long time. From our perspective a lot of people in the market continue to underestimate what that growth is going to be, so there's huge opportunities to innovate,\" said the co-CEO of Venture Global, Mike Sabel, at the Baker Hughes AM2020 event, as quoted by S&P Global Platts.\"The spot prices for LNG are very low right now, probably $4/MMBtu or less into Asia. That's not sustainable and doesn't help the development of LNG projects, but we think the short-term indications in the LNG market are not indicative of the long-term requirements,\" said another industry, executive, Next Decade's chief executive Matt Schatzmann, at the same event.Yet analysts are warning that U.S. LNG producers could be more vulnerable to the existing gas glut than others. Natural Gas Intel, for one, reported U.S. LNG plants might be forced to shut down if the price trend continues as it would make their product harder to sell in its top markets: Europe and Asia, mainly China. In Europe, there is already a significant oversupply and limited storage space. China, for its part, is still enforcing 25-percent tariffs on U.S. LNG imports.This context makes getting access to new funding difficult as noted by S&P in the downgrades.\"We are particularly concerned about some of the issuers' ability to access the capital markets given investor aversion to the space and their current bond trading yields,\" the ratings agency said.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

The outlook for crude oil and refined products demand does not look good right now, a tanker broker in Dubai told S&P Global Platts.   Charter rates for supertankers on key shipping routes from the United States and the Middle East to Asia have already dipped to their lowest levels since the middle of September, because the coronavirus outbreak has started to eat into oil demand in the world's top oil importer, China, ship brokers told Reuters earlier this week.Demand for jet fuel, gasoline, and diesel is likely to be suppressed in the coming weeks as airlines are canceling thousands of flights to and from China, and Chinese authorities are discouraging or outright banning travel in the areas most affected by the virus.China's oil demand amid the coronavirus outbreak is likely inflicting the worst oil demand shock to markets since the financial crisis of 2008-2009 and refiners are cutting refinery runs amid weak fuel demand.In addition, oil traders are scrambling to find spot buyers for crude oil outside China, but overall demand in wider Asia isn't great either, because of weakening refining margins.Related: Traders Scramble To Find Oil Buyers Amid Falling Chinese DemandIf demand continues to be depressed for months, tanker rates on the key oil shipping lanes in the world would dip, affecting the revenues of shipping firms.\"The impact on Chinese domestic oil products consumption will depend on how quickly transportation and industrial activities will return to normal levels. Demand for imported oil could take even longer to recover, as refineries, which were facing a capacity surplus before the outbreak, will need to absorb excess inventories,\" Fitch Ratings said earlier this week. The virus outbreak could aggravate an already expected surplus on the oil market this year, especially in the first half, \"potentially leading to more short-term pressure on oil prices,\" Fitch Ratings noted.

These are the largest energy firms in Russia, and they don't have access to capital at western banks to develop such projects.In the wake of the sanctions, many Western oil firms withdrew from joint ventures with Russian companies, which are now left without partnerships in technology needed to explore, drill, and potentially produce and process hard-to-extract oil and gas resources. Although Russian firms downplay the effects of the U.S. sanctions on their development plans, and although domestic companies are focused on developing in-house technology solutions to replace foreign-sourced tech, analysts believe that 100-percent local content technology in challenging projects would likely take years to implement.

        "content": "The fate of the latest oil sands mining project in Alberta may be decided by the estimates of carbon emission from the province's oil and gas industry--and Alberta and the federal government differ on how fast the oil-rich province is approaching its carbon emissions limit.According to data from the federal Canadian government, as cited by The Globe and Mail, Alberta will reach 87 megatons of emissions this year, while its cap is 100 megatons.The provincial government of Alberta, however, argues that the emissions in Alberta's oil industry are 67-68 megatons, as per Alberta Premier Jason Kenney.The federal government of Canada is set to decide by the end of this month whether to approve Teck Resources' Frontier Project--a truck-and-shovel oil sands mine located between Fort McMurray and Fort Chipewyan in northeast Alberta.The project, like many other energy projects in Canada in recent years, is polarizing the country. Analysts expect the federal government's decision to seal the fate of the oil sands industry in Canada.\"With half the emissions-intensity of the average oil sands projects, Teck Frontier represents the path forward for the world's third-largest oil reserves. It's important that Canada get it right and approve this project,\" Alberta Premier Kenney said last week.If the federal government rejects the project, it would send a \"devastating message\" to investors, he added.\"I think that would be a devastating message to send in terms of investor confidence at a time when we are struggling to attract foreign direct investment to the Canadian economy,\" Kenney said.The Frontier project, estimated to be worth US$15.6 billion (C$20.6 billion), is an open oil sands mine that would yield 260,000 bpd at peak production, with its life estimated at 40 years. Yet it must first be approved by the Liberal government that has strict climate change fighting goals. However, according to Teck Resources' CEO Don Lindsay, the project may not go through even if the government grants it approval. The problem, he said during an investor conference in Alberta recently, was oil prices, among other things.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "The technical panel of the OPEC+ group recommended extending the oil production cuts agreed last December to the end of 2020, the current president of OPEC, Algeria's oil minister, told media on Sunday. The group last week also recommended deeper cuts--of 600,000 bpd--to last until the end of Q2.Countering the potentially positive implications of this news, however, Oil and Gas Middle East quoted Russia's Energy Minister Alexander Novak as saying that Moscow needed more time to decide whether it will jump on board. At the time Novak was referring to the deeper cuts.\"[We do] not fully understand the situation and clear forecasts for the development of events in connection with coronavirus,\" Novak said last week as quoted by the media. \"To do this, more time is needed to see how the situation will develop, what [the] impact will be on world markets for oil.\"The official added there was still no evidence of a negative impact on Russian oil ands gas exports to China from the coronavirus outbreak.At the time of writing, it was as of yet uncertain if OPEC+ will even hold another emergency meeting before its originally scheduled one in March because of Russia's reluctance to commit to further cuts, Bloomberg reported.Related: Crashing Copper Prices Spell Trouble For OilMeanwhile, Algeria's top oil man, Mohamed Arkab, told Reuters \"The coronavirus epidemic has a negative impact on economic activities, especially on the transport, tourism and industry, in China particularly, and also increasingly in the Asian region and gradually in the world,\" which should motivate deeper and longer cuts in oil production.An S&P Global Platts survey found last week OPEC that production in January had fallen by 470,000 bpd from December. Yet this has not been enough to prop up prices so far, even coupled with the news that Libya's oil production is now less than 200,000 bpd, down from 1.2 million bpd at the start of the year, due to the continued oil port blockade.OPEC and several other oil producers led by Russia last December agreed to extend their production cuts of 1.2 million bpd until the end of March and the then decide on next steps. However, the coronavirus outbreak prompted an emergency meeting, at which OPEC came up with the proposal to deepen the cuts by another 600,000 bpd. As with the previous agreement, Russia will make or break the additional cuts. By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Iraq will reduce oil production from the Nahr Bin Omar oil field to a minimum to cut gas emissions and pollution, Reuters reported today, quoting the Iraqi state news agency.Arab News quoted the director general of the field's operator, Basra Oil Company, as saying \"Nahr Bin Omar oilfield is considered one of the most controversial fields because of the pollution and gas emissions. It has been decided to cut crude oil production to minimum and to stop operating all oil wells to provide environmental protection.\"Nahr bin Omar has reserves of some 6.5 billion barrels of oil and 12 billion cu ft of natural gas. Daily production of oil averages 40,000 bpd and gas production stands at 25 million cu ft daily.The decision to cut production at the field could be motivated by genuine--although not very typical--concern for the environment, but it could also prove to be a way of bringing Iraq closer to its production quota under the OPEC+ agreement. The latest data on OPEC production, from an S&P Global Platts survey, showed that Iraq and Nigeria continued to lagged behind their co-members in compliance.Interestingly enough, Iraq managed to produce more than it should despite the temporary shutdown of a field that pumps some 70,000 bpd in late January. The Al Ahdab field, operated by Chinese CNPC, stopped producing oil about a month ago amid widespread economic protests, sparking concern that more fields could be affected by the protests hurting the country's vital oil revenues. A week later, the field was back online after the government struck a deal with the security guards that had blockaded it, causing the shutdown.The protests also shut down another oil field twice in less than a month. The Nassiriya field, in southern Iraq, was first shut down in December and then in January as protesters demanded jobs, the Iraq Oil Report wrote.

        "content": "Libya's Azzawiya Oil Refining Company has suspended its operations for lack of feedstock amid the continued blockade of oil ports that has led to the shutdown of several fields, Reuters reported, adding that the refiner is completely out of stockpiled crude.Libya has lost more than a million barrels daily in production, with its average daily slumping from over 1.2 million bpd in early January to less than 200,000 bpd as of the end of last week, according to the National Oil Corporation as cited by local media.The company said it had also lost $1 billion from the blockade so far and urged the Libyan National Army and the tribal groups that seized the ports to lift the blockade.\"National Oil Corporation (NOC) renews its call for all blockades to be lifted to allow the corporation to resume production immediately, for the sake of Libya and its people,\" the statement read as quoted by the Libyan Express.In late January, NOC's chairman Mustafa Sanalla told Bloomberg Libya could lose all of its oil production if the blockade was not lifted soon and the latest production figures suggest that output may indeed be heading for zero.The blockade was an extension of the ongoing fight for control of the country and its oil revenues between the Libyan National Army, affiliated with the eastern government, and the Government of National Accord, which has been recognised by the UN. All oil revenues go into accounts controlled by the GNA and NOC, and the LNA is seeking to change that through the blockade.The economic situation in the North African country was the key topic of discussion at the latest round of UN talks on Libya. Bloomberg reported on the talks, noting that if they ended with a deal between the warring parties and production begins to ramp up, this would compromise OPEC's efforts to curb global supply amid the coronavirus scare.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

The price of a WTI barrel that was trading at $62.70 just one month ago is now trading at $50.45 per barrel--a drop of more than $12 per barrel, or nearly 20%, in just 30 days.The price of a Brent barrel, trading at $68.91 a month ago, has sunk to $54.52 today, a drop of over $14 per barrel, or nearly 21%.And it's more than just fearful trades.Earlier this week, anonymous Chinese officials said that China's oil demand had fallen by 20% compared to what is typical for the season--a figure that represents 3 million barrels per day, and more than all the oil produced in the Bakken and Eagle Ford basins on a daily basis combined.OPEC, too, feels that the effects have been dramatic enough to hold an emergency meeting to discuss the possibility of deeper or longer production cuts, even as OPEC member Libya is already producing 1 million bpd under its typical amount.The death toll from the coronavirus has risen to 638, with all but two of them limited to China. More than 31,000 people have been affected.Controversy surrounding China's handling of the virus swelled on Friday, after the Chinese doctor who tried to sound the alarm about the virus in December died this week from the virus. Police in China had previously silenced the doctor and took him in for questioning, forcing him to write a statement admitting illegal behavior, according to media reports.

        "title": "Rosneft Slumps On Possible US Sanctions Over Venezuela Ties",
        "content": "Shares in Russia's largest oil producer, Rosneft, slumped on Friday on the Moscow Stock Exchange, following a report on Thursday that the United States is thinking about slapping sanctions on the Russian oil giant for keeping business ties with the regime of Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro.Rosneft's shares opened sharply down on Friday and were losing 5 percent in the early afternoon, before erasing some of the losses to trade down 3.41 percent at 5:13 p.m. Moscow time.The share decline today was the sharpest one-day drop in nearly two years, since April 2018.On Thursday, Bloomberg reported, quoting people familiar with the issue, that the United States is considering whether to sanction Rosneft over its continued business with Nicolas Maduro's regime. The U.S. administration, however, is concerned that sanctions on Rosneft--a key trading partner for Venezuelan oil--would create chaos on the market and push oil prices up, according to Bloomberg's sources.Rosneft has four joint ventures with PDVSA that produce oil and it also became the largest receiver of Venezuelan crude oil last year: the Russian company sold the oil on behalf of PDVSA and kept the proceeds as payment on billions of dollars in loans to the embattled Venezuelan company.Earlier this week, a senior U.S. administration official said that the Trump administration is keeping a close eye on companies that are still doing business with Venezuela and is ready to mount pressure on them, up to and including sanctioning them.Last October, Elliott Abrams, U.S. Special Representative for Venezuela, told the Financial Times that Russia's Rosneft is \"really central to the regime's survival,\" because it buys the oil Venezuela produces and helps it sell the oil and arrange the financing. The U.S. Administration is thinking about slapping sanctions on Rosneft, but it hasn't done it yet, as it is looking at a broader context in the relations with Russia, Abrams told FT.The interview drew a reaction from Rosneft, which said in a statement that the U.S. is hypocritical in its selective sanctions and sanction waivers against Venezuela as it grants American and pro-American companies extensions of licenses to operate in Venezuela.\"Thus, USA officials demonstrate hypocrisy by selectively - in violation of international law - granting advantages to \"their\" companies to the detriment of competitors,\" Rosneft said last October.

        "content": "The federal Canadian government is preparing a financial aid package for Alberta in case it decides against a controversial large-scale oil sands project, Reuters reports, citing sources close to the cabinet.\"Rejecting Teck without providing Alberta something in return would be political suicide,\" one of the sources said. This means the government must be prepared to compensate the oil province to dull the pain.Teck Resources' Frontier oil sands project, valued at some $15.7 billion (C$20.6 billion) will produce some 260,000 bpd of crude oil at peak production and will have a productive life of 40 years.It is as controversial as any new oil sands project would be under a Liberal government that has pledged to do more about climate change, but for Alberta it is essential not just as a job creator but as an indicator of this government's readiness to support--or defeat--Alberta's oil industry as a whole.The Liberals would be careful to do the latter, the Reuters sources said, after they lost all seats in Alberta at last year's election precisely because of their negative attitude to new energy projects that have depressed the oil industry in the province.Yet there is little wiggle room. As one analyst put it right after the elections, \"We have got a Liberal minority and the balance of power shifts to the NDP and the Greens, who are completely opposed to any progressive energy policies.\"This means it is quite likely that Ottawa would reject the Frontier project, angering Alberta. The implications of such a development are grim for the oil province but none too rosy for the Liberals either; they would have to find a way to make up for their decision on Frontier in a way that would satisfy Alberta.It's worth noting, however, that even if the federal government approves the Frontier project, Teck might decide to shelve it: when it proposed the development, oil was trading much higher than it is trading now, casting a shadow over the economic viability of the project.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

The limit will be in force for 30 days.\"I realize there will be an effect on the economy of the country ... but it is very, very important that we do not sacrifice safety,\" Transport Minister Marc Garneau said.\"To have two major derailments that are incredibly serious is something that is almost incomprehensible,\" an MP for the Moose Jaw--Lake Centre--Lanigan constituency where the accidents occurred said, as quoted by the Toronto Sun. \"I am not a big believer in coincidence, and this seems to be that it's more than just coincidence.\"The first derailment occurred in December, when some 19 cars went off the rails and some 1.5 million liters of crude oil leaked out. In the second accident, more than 30 cars went off the rails, with a dozen of them catching fire.Oil train traffic in Canada has increased because of the opposition to the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project that has delayed the start of work. The expansion might never get built, which means there will be even more oil trains running across Canada to transport the growing output of heavy crude to markets.In early 2019, then-premier Rachel Notley said Alberta would spend $2.78 billion (C$3.7 billion) on leasing 4,400 additional rail cars to transport some 120,000 bpd of heavy crude to the market. Total volumes of oil moved by rail out of Alberta last year hit a record, and this year's volumes are seen even higher since the pipeline network can't cope with the oil being produced. This would mean a greater risk of derailments simply because of the number of trains that will be on the railroads.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "As the coronavirus continues to batter fuel demand in China, the country's second-largest refiner, state-held PetroChina, is cutting refinery runs and is talking to key suppliers in the Middle East about possibly deferring some crude oil loadings or reducing volumes, a senior PetroChina official with direct knowledge of the plans told Reuters on Monday. The Chinese refiner doesn't see fuel demand rebounding in March, the official told Reuters, adding that PetroChina is in discussions with its major suppliers in the Middle East--including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Kuwait--about potentially deferring crude cargo loadings or cutting imports from those suppliers.Should PetroChina, and other Chinese refiners for that matter, cut loading volumes or defer cargoes, the oil glut on the market in Q1 will swell even more than analysts and OPEC had predicted.  PetroChina will be reducing its crude oil throughput by 320,000 barrels per day (bpd) in February compared to its original refinery run plans, the official told Reuters. The February cut would be equal to around 10 percent of PetroChina's average fuel production of some 3.32 million bpd, according to Reuters estimates.Related: OPEC's Oil Production Plunges, But It May Not Be EnoughPetroChina joins other refiners in the world's top oil importer to have trimmed crude processing rates as the deadly virus outbreak is crippling demand with all the travel restrictions and thousands of canceled flights to, from, and within China. Due to weak fuel demand and depressed industrial activity, Chinese refiners--from the biggest refiner in Asia, Sinopec, to the independent refiners in Shandong--are cutting refinery runs, while commodity trading houses and oil majors are scrambling to find spot buyers for crude oil outside China.  According to estimates from IHS Markit, the virus outbreak is set to knock out at least 1.7 million barrels per day (bpd) of refinery runs in China in February, compared to an otherwise projected growth of 760,000 bpd. This would be \"the sharpest single-month decline of 1 MMb/d in history,\" Xiaonan Feng, Research Analyst at IHS Markit, said last week.  The slowdown in China's industrial activity and the shutdown of factories amid the coronavirus outbreak is causing the worst shock to oil demand in over a decade, Jeff Currie, global head of commodities research at Goldman Sachs, said last week.

The permitting process has also significantly accelerated in recent years. Back in 2016, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) took on average257 days to approve a drilling application, while that time has now more than halved. In FY 2019, it took BLM on average 108 days to approve drilling applications, federal officials told AP.  BLM said last year, referring to FY 2018, that it had improved its oil and gas leasing program by reducing processing times for Applications for Permit to Drill (APDs). Lease sales resulted in a record US$1.1 billion from 28 oil and gas lease sales held in FY 2018, BLM said in May last year. While the Trump Administration says it is protecting U.S. energy production and jobs while boosting royalties for the federal government and states, critics of the shorter permitting process say that the streamlining of drilling approvals comes at the expense of reduced environmental considerations to protect the land and waters and their habitats.Meanwhile, the U.S. federal agencies regulating offshore leases are considering granting royalty relief to new oil and gas drilling in shallow waters in the Gulf of Mexico, in a bid to avoid the stranding of what they estimate could be US$20 billion worth of American oil and gas resources.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

Oil firms in Russia have long balked at continued production cuts, arguing that the cuts hinder their production expansion plans, while giving more market share to U.S. shale.The OPEC+ technical panel will meet again before the ministerial meeting of OPEC and its Russia-led allies currently set for March 5-6, OPEC sources told TASS on Tuesday. At the panel meeting, Russia is expected to tell its partners its position on whether deeper cuts are necessary in Q2 to mitigate the impact of the coronavirus on oil demand.

U.S. energy-related emissions are now down by almost 1 gigaton from their peak in 2000, the IEA has estimated. Low natural gas prices last year further undermined coal use for electricity generation in the United States, the IEA said, noting that the share of gas in U.S. electricity generation reached a record high of 37 percent.U.S. energy related CO2 emissions fell by 2.1 percent year on year in 2019, according to EIA estimates from earlier this year. Energy-related CO2 emissions are expected to continue their annual declines into 2020 and 2021, and if the forecast holds, emissions will have declined in 7 of the 10 years from 2012 to 2021.While emissions from advanced economies dropped, emissions from emerging economies increased, the IEA said in its report today. Emissions in China rose, yet at a slower pace, because of slower economic growth and higher shares of electricity generation from renewables and nuclear power. India's energy-related emissions grew moderately last year, with strong renewables growth prompting coal-fired electricity generation to fall for the first time since 1973.

        "title": "U.S. Budget Proposal Includes Sale Of 15 Mln Barrels Strategic Reserve Oil",
        "content": "The budget proposal President Trump released yesterday calls for the sale of 15 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve of the United States.The proceeds from the sale will be used to fund various projects, including the $242-million \"fixing\" of a Naval Petroleum Reserve in California, Reuters reports.Unlike with other proposals, this one might win bipartisan support: both Republican and Democratic legislators are in favor of sales from the SPR because its current level is above that required by international agreements about minimum necessary supplies and because two laws, passed in 2015 and 2018, respectively, also envisage sales of 15 million barrels of crude from the SPR this year and in 2021.Another law, the 21st Century Cures Act, passed in 2016, called for the sale of some 25 million barrels from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve between 2017 and 2019.The U.S. government set up the Strategic Petroleum Reserve more than forty years ago, in the wake of the Arab oil embargo that made the United States acutely aware of just how dependent its economy was on imported crude. To avoid a repeat of the painful fuel shortages the embargo caused, the U.S. began stocking up on crude.Related: The \"Black Swan\" Event That Could Unravel OPEC's EffortsYet now times are as different as can be. The United States is producing about 13 million barrels of oil daily and imports average 6.6 million bpd, according to the latest weekly data from the Energy Information Administration. The U.S. is much less dependent on imports of oil.In fact, In the last few years, the SPR has turned into what the former head of the EIA calls a piggy bank. Legislators have been selling portions of the reserve to plug budget holes and reduce deficits, and also for backing new bills.This has sparked a dispute on the actual purpose of the SPR, with some, including President Trump a couple of years ago, arguing that it does not need to be as large as it is, and others countering that while local production may be good now, things could change, and having a cushion as solid as the SPR would be a smart idea.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "title": "Petrobras Breaks Another Oil Production Record",
        "content": "Petrobras announced it had broken another production record in the last quarter of 2019, producing more than 3 million bpd of oil equivalent throughout the period, Reuters reports, adding that the output increase came thanks to production in the presalt zone offshore Brazil.The fourth-quarter production figure was a 5.1-percent increase on the third quarter, and a 13.7-percent improvement on the fourth quarter of 2018. Around half of the total, or 1.533 million bpd of oil equivalent, came from deposits in the presalt area, Petrobras said in a securities filing. This was 12.1 percent higher than presalt oil output in the third quarter and as much as 46.4 percent higher than output a year earlier.Last month, Brazil's energy regulator, ANP, reported that the country had produced record high amounts of oil and gas in 2019, with the total exceeding 1 billion barrels for the first time in history. The daily average throughout the year, according to ANP, was 3.106 million bpd.Petrobras's average last year was 2.77 million barrels of oil equivalent daily. For this year, however, Petrobras expects to produce a little less than that. The company's guidance is for 2.7 million bpd of oil equivalent, factoring in planned maintenance and natural depletion at some mature fields. It is reducing investments in onshore, shallow water and post-salt fields in favor of the presalt zone.The focus of attention this year will continue to be on the presalt fields as the biggest production growth driver. Just the so-called transfer-of-rights area that Petrobras recently took control over from the Brazilian government could hold up to 15 billion barrels of untapped crude. This would double Brazil's total reserves to 30 billion barrels and make it the world's fifth-largest oil producer.Petrobras is currently locked in a dispute with workers who have been striking for ten days, accusing the company of failing to stick to a collective bargaining agreement inked last year. The company is hiring emergency workers to maintain operations.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Nigeria assured foreign oil investors on Monday that the African OPEC producer is open to business and can guarantee high returns on investment, the country's President Muhammadu Buhari told an energy conference.\"Let me assure our foreign investors that your investments in Nigeria are very much secured and this can't be better anywhere else,\" the president said in an address at the Nigeria International Petroleum Summit via a representative.Nigeria's oil production and exports have had a tough couple of years recently. First, pipeline sabotages by militants in Nigeria's oil-rich Niger Delta area crippled production and exports of the joint ventures of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) with foreign oil firms.Over the past two years, militant activity has subsided, allowing Nigeria to boost its crude oil production, and also making Africa's largest oil producer a full-fledged participant in the production cuts of the OPEC+ coalition.Now pipeline vandalism and oil theft are major concerns for the industry and investment climate.Nigeria is set to finally pass a new bill regulating the petroleum industry by the middle of this year, after nearly two decades of delays, the country's Minister of Petroleum Timipre Sylva said at the same event on Monday.Related: Are Oil Markets Overreacting To The Coronavirus?Mele Kyari, Group Managing Director at NNPC, said at the international petroleum conference today that \"We are, more than ever before, committed to working with stakeholders to increase our crude oil production from 2.3 million bbl per day to 3 million bbl per day.\"The recent amendment to the Deep Offshore Act will improve financial stability and investor confidence, NNPC's head said, and added that the Nigerian state oil firm is working with technical partners to revamp its three refineries in Port Harcourt, Kaduna, and Warri. NNPC has completed Phase 1 of the Port Harcourt project and is moving to Phase 2, while it also works on Phase 1 for the other two refineries, the company's managing director said.

        "content": "Tesla's Shanghai Gigafactory resumed operations on Monday after weeks of a government-mandated temporary shutdown due to the coronavirus outbreak in China, Japanese outlet The Asahi Shimbun reported today.Tesla restarted work on its China-built Model 3 in the Pudong Xinqu area of Shanghai on the morning of February 10, the publication said, citing a driver of shuttle buses for employees.Some 40 shuttle buses, compared to the typical 100 buses, took local employees to the Shanghai factory, the driver said.\"Employees who have returned from outside the city cannot come to work because they are required to be quarantined for 14 days,\" the driver told The Asahi Shimbun, adding that those who reported for work on Monday are only part of the employees who have been given the all-clear and do not need to be quarantined.  In early January, Tesla delivered its first cars to customers from its newly built Gigafactory in Shanghai, just a year after it broke ground on the site for the construction of its Gigafactory in China. The coronavirus outbreak later in January halted a lot of industrial activities in China and forced the authorities to extend the Lunar New Year holidays, while a number of foreign firms closed shops, offices, restaurants, and production lines.Related: Are Oil Markets Overreacting To The Coronavirus?In its Q4 earnings call at the end of January, Tesla's chief financial officer Zachary Kirkhorn said, in reference to the virus impact on the company's operations in China:\"At this point, we're expecting a 1 to 1.5 week delay in the ramp of Shanghai built Model 3 due to a government required factory shutdown. This may slightly impact profitability for the quarter, but is limited as the profit contribution from Model 3 Shanghai remains in the early stages.\"This weekend, a government official from Shanghai said - as carried by Reuters - that the local authorities would help manufacturing firms, including Tesla, to restart production in and around the city as quickly as possible.

        "content": "The crude oil benchmarks in the Middle East, Dubai and Oman, continued to fall on Monday as demand in Asia slumps as the coronavirus has now claimed more victims, and more quickly, than the SARS outbreak in 2003.Oman and Dubai futures dropped for a third consecutive trading day, after falling to a nearly year-low last Thursday, due to reduced economic activity and depressed fuel demand in the world's top oil importer, China.Asian refiners are not showing any buying interest right now, sour crude oil traders told S&P Global Platts this week.  Due to weak fuel demand and depressed industrial activity, Chinese refiners--from the biggest refiner in Asia, Sinopec, to the independent refiners in Shandong--are cutting refinery runs, while commodity trading houses and oil majors are scrambling to find spot buyers for crude oil outside China.The slump in the Oman and Dubai prices are indicative of the bearish sentiment in the Middle East crude complex as market participants see the Middle Eastern oil producers feel the pinch from the hit to oil demand in what is typically the key oil demand growth driver.The slowdown in China's industrial activity is causing the worst shock to oil demand in over a decade, Jeff Currie, global head of commodities research at Goldman Sachs, said in an interview on Bloomberg last week.Saudi Arabia reacted last week to the depressed demand in Asia by slashing its official selling prices (OSPs) to the region for March. Although price cuts were expected, they were deeper than analysts had forecast. Saudi Aramco slashed its OSP for Asia for the Arab Light crude by $0.80 per barrel to a premium of $2.90 over the Oman/Dubai benchmark--a deeper cut than a Bloomberg poll of traders had expected. Aramco left only Arab Heavy prices for Asia unchanged, while it raised prices for Europe and cut the prices for the U.S.   By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

We want to try something different.\"The Nikola Badger, announced this week, will be able to operate on FCEV / battery-blend or BEV mode at any given time, while it can drive 300 miles in BEV mode for those that do not have access to hydrogen, the company says.Nikola Corporation currently plans 700 hydrogen stations to give North America hydrogen coverage. The company will announce initial locations for hydrogen stations in the U.S. this quarter.Nikola has already created hydrogen fuel cell electric or fully electric semi-trucks.\"Nikola has billions worth of technology in our semi-truck program, so why not build it into a pickup truck?\" Trevor Milton, Nikola Corporation's CEO, said in a statement.\"I have been working on this pickup program for years and believe the market is now ready for something that can handle a full day's worth of work without running out of energy,\" Milton says.

        "content": "Marathon Oil has budgeted $2.4 billion for this year in what it called disciplined total capital budget, which was 11 percent lower than what the company spent last year, Marathon said in the report of its fourth-quarter and full-2019 results.Marathon booked a net profit of $480 million for 2019 and a net loss of $20 million for the fourth quarter, missing analyst estimates, but not unsurprisingly given the oil price environment that has eaten into many of the industry's profits.While the company reported improvements in well costs and asset sales as it streamlined its operations so that it could focus on core assets at home and a few international locations, the budget for 2020 suggests that Marathon will continue to be careful with spending. This, in turn, highlights the fact that despite lowering production costs in the shale patch, producers are still vulnerable to low prices.The company expects its domestic oil production this year to rise by about 6 percent despite the lower spending. It also expects the same rate of growth for 2021, but this would be contingent on price levels for West Texas Intermediate. Last year, for example, the drop in WTI pushed realized oil prices for Marathon by 2.1 percent to an average of $54.83 a barrel, the company also said in its report.Marathon Oil said it had returned $510 million to shareholders, of which $350 million were share buybacks and $160 million were dividends. The company noted that the capital it returned to shareholders came entirely from organic free cash flow. This sets Marathon apart from some Big Oil majors, which are returning to shareholders more than they are making, a study from the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis recently suggested.Marathon, according to its report, seems to be doing better.\"We continue to improve our underlying corporate returns, we've delivered positive organic free cash flow for eight consecutive quarters, and we've returned over 20% of our cash flow from operations back to our shareholders since the beginning of 2018,\" President and CEO Lee Tillman said in the Q4/full-2019 news release.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "The majority of Russian oil companies are on board with extending the agreement to cut oil production through the end of Q2, but most did not support deepening those cuts, according to Ravil Maganov, first executive vice president of Lukoil cited by S&P Global Platts.Oil prices have fallen more than 20% since the start of the year as the coronavirus has stifled demand for crude oil, causing OPEC to rethink its production cut strategy.The comment was made after Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak met on Wednesday with Kazakh energy minister Nurlan Nogayev and then representatives from Russian oil companies to discuss OPEC's recommendations.Last week, OPEC+'s joint technical committee recommended extending the current production cuts to the end of the year, and deeper cuts--another 600,000 bpd--through the end of Q2. But Russian oil companies, unsurprisingly, aren't scrambling for a chance to cut more production.Gazprom Neft's CEO Alexander Dyukov said that \"Given the current situation on the market, it makes sense to extend the agreement through the second quarter and then monitor.\"Nogayev, on the other hand, seemed more receptive to the idea of different cuts, saying that Kazakhstan would work out \"a joint position\" with Russia where Kazakhstan would cut another 20,000 bpd, cautioning that no final decision had yet been made.In reality, the final decision lies with the government, not the individual oil companies. OPEC+ has discussed the possibility of moving up its March 5-6 meeting in order to discuss how best to address the current state of the oil market. Whatever decision is eventually made, Russia will need to be on board, as OPEC no longer has enough clout on its own to manipulate the oil markets like it used to.OPEC on Wednesday slashed global oil demand growth to 990,000 bpd in 2020, down by 230,000 bpd, as the virus takes its toll.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

The oil major also aims to halve the carbon intensity of the products it sells by 2050 or sooner, joining other majors such as Shell and Equinor which also target to reduce the carbon footprint of the energy products they sell.Last week, Equinor unveiled a plan to reduce the net carbon intensity, from initial production to final consumption, of energy produced by at least 50 percent by 2050. Shell has also set short-term targets for reducing the net carbon footprint of the energy products it sells.BP, for its part, plans to install methane measurement at all its major oil and gas processing sites by 2023 and has plans to reduce methane intensity of operations by 50 percent. The group will also target to raise the share of investment in non-oil and gas businesses over time.Yet, BP will continue to stick to its fundamental commitment to shareholders to grow sustainable free cash flow and shareholder distributions over the long term, to cut debt, and to deliver its 2021 free cash flow targets.Commenting on the 'net zero' plan, CEO Looney said in a statement:\"This will certainly be a challenge, but also a tremendous opportunity. It is clear to me, and to our stakeholders, that for BP to play our part and serve our purpose, we have to change. And we want to change - this is the right thing for the world and for BP.\"  Related: North Dakota's Crude Oil Production Could Peak Within 5 Years\"Looney deserves support and credit for starting BP on the journey towards carbon neutrality and policy leadership,\" Fred Krupp, President, Environmental Defense Fund, said, commenting on BP's plan.Greenpeace UK also commented, saying: \"Bernard Looney wants the company to be seen as kinder and cleaner, committed to tackling climate change. But unless he pulls BP out of the fossil fuel business, anything else is just spin.\"\"BP's net zero carbon ambition might sound impressive, but means little in practice.

The reduced industrial and transportation activity amid the coronavirus outbreak--with factories shut, cities locked down, and travel restrictions imposed--has already started to show in China's gas demand. Moreover, demand will likely continue to be depressed until industrial activities recover fully after the outbreak, analysts told Reuters.In LNG demand, analysts at Bernstein see China's demand for the super-chilled fuel rising by just 4 percent annually in 2020, compared to a previous forecast of 13-percent growth.\"Given that 60% of Chinese gas demand comes from power and industry, 2019-nCoV is impacting the gas market at a time of underlying weakness,\" Gavin Thompson, Vice Chairman, Energy - Asia Pacific, at Wood Mackenzie, said last week, noting that demand in China was slowing even before the coronavirus outbreak.In a report this week, WoodMac estimates China's demand would reduce by between 6 bcm and 14 bcm this year, using a 'best case' and more 'prolonged case' scenario.Chinese LNG demand this year is now also expected to be lower than the previous forecast, by between 2.5 Mt and 6.3 Mt, and \"this will create a sustained drop not only in North Asian LNG prices, but also at European and US gas hubs prices,\" the consultancy said.The lower LNG imports in China could put the natural gas markets in Europe and Asia under severe stress, Fitch Ratings said on Tuesday.\"This could significantly delay the supply-demand rebalancing expected in 2020,\" the rating agency added.

Last month, Occidental was reported to have started layoffs across the United States in a drive to further cut costs after the acquisition of Anadarko.

The North African country is currently producing less than 200,000 bpd of crude because of an oil port blockade by tribal groups loyal to the Libyan National Army, an organization affiliated with the eastern Libyan government.The eastern government and the LNA, led by General Khalifa Haftar, are fighting for control over the country with the UN-recognized Government of National Accord. This control is inseparable from the control over the national oil industry.Right now, only the Tripoli-based National Oil Corporation has the right to sell Libyan oil abroad. Until last year, LNA and Haftar worked together with the NOC, but last year Haftar took everyone by surprise by launching an offensive against Tripoli, claiming that soon Libya would have one single government.As a result, Libya's oil production has gone from over 1.2 million bpd to less than 200,000 bpd, with NOC suffering losses so far estimated at around $1.3 billion as oil fields have to be shut down because of the blockade. Earlier this week, a refinery also shut down. Azzawiya Oil Refining Company said it was out of feedstock and had no stockpiled oil to process.The vote on the next resolution for Libya is set for tomorrow, according to a diplomatic source that spoke to Sputnik.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "The American Petroleum Institute (API) estimated on Tuesday a larger than anticipated crude oil inventory build of 6-million barrels for the week ending February 7, compared to analyst expectations of a 2.987-million-barrel build in inventory.Last week saw a larger than expected build in crude oil inventories of 4.18-million barrels, according to API data. The EIA's estimates were for a slightly smaller build of 3.4-million barrels for that week.Oil prices were trading slightly up in the afternoon hours, but hardly much of a recovery given the brutal price slide that the oil markets have experienced over the last month as the coronavirus continues to stifle economic activity and threaten oil.At 3:34 pm EST on Tuesday the WTI benchmark was trading up on the day by $0.16 (+0.32%) at $49.73--but still down slightly week on week. The price of a Brent barrel was also trading up on Tuesday, by $0.64 (+1.20%), at $53.91--but still off around $0.40 from last week.Overall, the benchmarks have slid more than $14 per barrel since the first week of the year.The API this week also reported a build of 1.1 million barrels of gasoline for week ending February 7, after last week's 1.96-million-barrel build. This week's large gasoline build compares to analyst expectations of a 546,000-barrel-build for the week.Distillate inventories were down by 2.3 million barrels for the week, compared to last week's 1.78-million-barrel draw, while Cushing inventories rose by 1.3 million barrels.US crude oil production as estimated by the Energy Information Administration showed that production for the week ending January 31 slipped slightly to 12.9 million bpd off just 100,000 bpd from an all-time high.At 4:42 pm EDT, WTI was trading at $50.02, while Brent was trading at $54.25.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

But then civil war in South Sudan broke out in 2013 that further complicated oil production.Currently, South Sudan pumps around 180,000 barrels of oil per day (bpd).The two main oil consortia operating in South Sudan are Chinese-led Dar Petroleum Operating and the Greater Pioneer Operating. According to the environmental reports the AP has obtained, the companies and the government of South Sudan have been aware for years of those reports and have buried them.According to non-profit organizations, South Sudan's oil operations are one of the dirtiest in the world.Related: Oil Traders Could Lose Big On Coronavirus PanicLast month, South Sudan's government said that it looks to have a full environmental impact audit of all its oil-producing fields and conduct such audits ahead of any new exploration and drilling in the country.\"The sector has in the past caused a loss of grazing land, deforestation, soil and water contamination, and health issues in and around oil-producing areas,\" the South Sudan government further noted.South Sudan's President Salva Kiir said in August last year that he \"will not tolerate irresponsible activities in the oil sector\" and has promised that the era of \"bad business\" is coming to an end.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Brazil's Petrobras will keep as long as necessary the contingency plans to keep operations unaffected amid a strike of oil workers, the state-held oil firm's chief executive Roberto Castello Branco told Reuters on Friday.The biggest oil workers' union, Federacao Unica dos Petroleiros (FUP), called a strike that began on February 1 and is now set to enter its third week. The workers are protesting the closure of a Petrobras fertilizer plant and the layoffs of the employees. The workers' union is demanding that Petrobras readmit those workers.Employees at Petrobras are not reporting for work in nine states across the country, but the union has said the workers would avoid disruption of fuel supplies.Petrobras says that its production has not been affected by the strike as it \"took all appropriate measures to assure no disruption in the oil and gas production, refining activities and fuel supply,\" as carried by Reuters.A week into the strike, on February 7, the state oil company said that it was hiring emergency workers to ensure continued operations during the strike. The firm says that it has the right to hire workers to help it cope with the strike because the workers' unions had disregarded a court order to have 90 percent of staff working.On Wednesday, Brazil's Supreme Court upheld the court ruling that 90 percent of Petrobras's employees should continue to work, although workers' unions have called a strike at the company, Reuters reported, citing the court decision it had seen.While the strike continued, Petrobras announced earlier this week that it had set another production record in the last quarter of 2019, producing more than 3 million bpd of oil equivalent throughout the period, thanks to production in the pre-salt zone offshore Brazil. The fourth-quarter production figure was a 5.1-percent increase on the third quarter, and a 13.7-percent improvement on the fourth quarter of 2018. Around half of the total, or 1.533 million bpd of oil equivalent, came from deposits in the pre-salt area, Petrobras said in a securities filing.

        "title": "Natural Gas Hits Lowest February Price In Two Decades",
        "content": "Warmer winter weather this year has reduced U.S. natural gas demand for heating, and as production growth continues to exceed demand growth, U.S. natural gas prices slumped this month to their lowest February levels in two decades, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Friday.Natural gas prices at the Henry Hub benchmark closed at $1.77 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) on Monday, February 10. This was the lowest closing price for a day in February since at least 2001, according to Bloomberg and FRED data compiled by the EIA. The $1.77 per MMBtu price was also the lowest price in any month in nearly four years--since early March 2016.   Natural gas prices dipped to below US$2 per MMBtu this January for the first time in almost four years. This winter season, the glut is further aggravated by higher gas production in the Permian, higher than normal inventories, and warmer weather so far this winter.  As natural gas production outpaces demand growth, less gas has been withdrawn from underground storage this winter, the EIA said.This winter's heating season began with the third-lowest level of natural gas inventory in a decade. But by mid-January, inventories had already reached relatively high levels for the middle of the winter, according to EIA estimates.The latest Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report showed that as of February 7, working gas in storage stocks were 601 Bcf higher than this time last year and 215 Bcf above the five-year average.January 2020 was the fifth warmest January on record, according to the 126-year climate record of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).In its February Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO) from earlier this week, EIA expects Henry Hub prices will remain below $2.00/MMBtu in February and March. Prices are seen rising in Q2, with lower U.S. natural gas production and higher demand for natural gas-fired power generation.For full year 2020, EIA forecasts that Henry Hub natural gas spot prices will average $2.21/MMBtu, and then rise to an annual average of $2.53/MMBtu next year.

J. Ruest said as quoted by the Globe and Mail.The federal Indigenous Services Minister, Marc Miller, called on the protesters to lift the blockades.\"My request, that I ask you kindly to consider, is to discontinue the protest and barricade of the train tracks as soon as practicable,\" he said in a statement.Meanwhile, TC Energy, which is building the pipeline, has had to resort to police assistance to keep working on the pipeline. The infrastructure is vital for the LNG Canada project--the first of its kind to be built in Canada--to which it will supply natural gas from Dawson Creek, close to the border with Alberta, to Kitimat, where the liquefaction trains of LNG Canada will be built.LNG Canada is a project of Shell, with a 40-percent stake, Malaysia's Petronas with 25 percent, PetroChina with 15 percent, Mitsubishi with 15 percent, and South Korea's Kogas with 5 percent.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

Most of the oil in the Gulf state are concentrated in Abu Dhabi, with reserves at 92.2 billion barrels out of the Emirates' total 97.8 billion barrels.Last year, the UAE's Supreme Petroleum Council announced new discoveries had added 7 billion barrels to the country's total, making it the six-largest holder of oil reserves in the world with 105 billion barrels.This year, the Emirates also discovered a major gas reservoir shared by Abu Dhabi and Dubai. With reserves estimated at 80 trillion cu ft of natural gas, the Jebel Ali field could become the largest gas discovery in the world in 13 years, Bloomberg reported earlier this month.The gas discovery is extra good news for the oil economy of the UAE. With oil prices trending down and the outlook less than favorable, the Emirates, like other Gulf producers, are seeking to reduce their dependence on oil revenues.This effort has become more important than ever now that oil demand in the world's second-largest consumer and largest importer, China, has been affected by the coronavirus outbreak. In fact, OPEC itself had to revise its outlook for global oil demand by 230,000 bpd for this year in its latest Monthly Oil Market Report because of the effect of the epidemic on oil demand.This means OPEC now expects global oil demand to grow by about 990,000 bpd this year, to reach some 100.73 million bpd in total. Yet with non-OPEC production growth continuing, demand for the cartel's oil, including UAE oil, may be affected more deeply than before. Asia and China in particular are key markets for Gulf oil and competition for these markets will only get more intense this year, judging by these forecast trends.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "A cargo of 950,000 barrels of crude that had been stranded at sea for about a year has finally docked at the port of Jose in Venezuela, Bloomberg reports, adding that the cargo was worth around $50 million at today's prices.The cargo, on the Gerd Knutsen tanker, was loaded in January 2019 but never reached its destination on the U.S. Gulf Coast because of the escalation of U.S. sanctions against Venezuela and the effective takeover of Citgo by Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido with the support of Washington.Gerd Knutsen set sail a day before U.S. President Donald Trump recognized Guaido as interim president of Venezuela and a week before he announced further sanctions on Venezuela, targeting its oil industry. A month later, the opposition-dominated Venezuelan National Assembly picked a new board for Citgo. PDVSA, however, the parent company, refused to allow Gerd Knutsen to set sail for the United States.Since then, it has been a battle for control of the $50-million cargo between Caracas and Citgo.Much of this battle took place in U.S. courts. According to reports at the time, the Maduro-loyal board of Citgo, based in Venezuela, wrote to the captain of Gerd Knutsen to ask that the cargo be released to Citgo's parent, PDVSA, in December 2019. The second Citgo board tried to block this release by obtaining a court order, Reuters recalls in a timeline of the events.The court, in Delaware, ruled in favor of the Guaido-affiliated Citgo board, calling Maduro's attempt to get the cargo back \"legally invalid\". It told the Citgo board to deliver its ruling to the captain of Gerd Knutsen but it appears Caracas was quicker and the cargo returned to its point of origin.Meanwhile, the Maduro government is ceding control over the country's oil fields to foreign companies to keep the oil flowing and the economy trudging along amid the U.S. sanctions, the New York Times reported earlier this month. Foreign companies are taking over the day-to-day operation of the fields, managing the exports of crude, and even hiring the security for the fields.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Israel ordered on Thursday natural gas production at the huge offshore Leviathan field be reduced by around 40 percent after a fault was detected in a subsea pipeline leading to the wells, the energy ministry said.There wasn't any damage to the platform and associated facilities, nor any leak into the sea, the ministry added, as carried by the Jerusalem Post.After the fault was discovered, the energy ministry told the operator of the platform, U.S.-based Noble Energy, to cut the volumes of natural gas production by 40 percent.Production will be allowed to increase only after all necessary tests are successfully completed, the ministry said.  Leviathan has just begun production and the fault discovered on Thursday was the second malfunction on the site this week. Early on Tuesday, a power outage led to the burning off of gas, and operations were suspended for several hours.There is no connection between the glitch on Tuesday and the fault discovered on Thursday, the Israeli energy ministry said.Leviathan--discovered in 2010--together with other fields discovered offshore Israel in the past decade such as Tamar, Karish, and Tanin, is expected to help Israel become energy independent.A senior official at Noble Energy said at the beginning of December that Leviathan was set to begin gas supply to the local market within three weeks and to start exports to Egypt and Jordan shortly after that, in a major milestone for the energy landscape in Israel and the Eastern Mediterranean.  Noble Energy announced first gas at Leviathan on December 31, when J. Keith Elliott, Senior Vice President, Offshore, said:\"Leviathan natural gas provides redundancy in supply domestically and helps transition Israel to become a significant exporter of energy to regional and global customers for the first time.\"Israeli natural gas exports to Egypt started in the middle of January.\"This move also allows Israel to export some of its natural gas to Europe through Egypt's LNG facilities, and promote Egypt's status as a regional gas hub,\" the Israeli energy ministry said in mid-January.

As of 2015, the oil production capacity in the neutral zone stood at a total of 600,000 bpd, equally divided between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA). Production from the zone averaged around 500,000 bpd just before the shutdown of the two oil fields, Khafji and Wafra, in 2014-2015.Operational differences and a worsening in bilateral relations led to the suspension of production back in 2015. The worsening came as Saudi Arabia renewed Chevron's concession for Wafra. According to the Kuwaiti side, Riyadh did that without consulting it.Related: Another Oil Major Bails On Marcellus ShaleThe two neighbors now have agreed to restart the two oilfields, which could put an additional 500,000 bpd-600,000 bpd on the oil market, at full capacity.Last month, Kuwait said that it expects its share of the oil production from the Neutral Zone to be 250,000 bpd by the end of 2020.Earlier this month, sources from Kuwait and Saudi Arabia told Oilprice that trial production of 10,000 bpd would begin at the Khafji field on or around February 25.

The virus outbreak is additionally depressing China's already slowing gas demand growth.The lower LNG imports in China could put the natural gas markets in Europe and Asia under severe stress, Fitch Ratings said on Tuesday.\"This could significantly delay the supply-demand rebalancing expected in 2020,\" the rating agency added.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "title": "Total Looks To Stop Selling Fuel Oil To Power Plants",
        "content": "Supermajor Total wants to stop selling fuel oil--one of the most carbon-intensive refinery products--for power generation in order to reduce its carbon footprint, the company's chief executive Patrick Pouyanne told Reuters in an interview published on Friday.This is the latest attempt from an oil and gas major to cut its carbon footprint as the French company aims to be known as an energy company rather than oil and gas major.  According to Total's data cited by Reuters, fuel oil represented about 5 percent of the company's total production of refined oil products in 2018.Total's marketing division is considering the idea to stop selling fuel oil for power generation, a spokesman for the company told Reuters.Reducing the carbon footprint fits in Total's ambition to reduce the carbon intensity of the energy products it makes available to customers by 15 percent between 2015 -- the date of the Paris Agreement -- and 2030.Other majors are also pledging reductions in carbon emissions. Last week, Equinor unveiled a plan to reduce the net carbon intensity, from initial production to final consumption, of energy produced by at least 50 percent by 2050.Shell has also set short-term targets for reducing the net carbon footprint of the energy products it sells.In the latest pledge from an oil major, BP said on Wednesday that it aims to become a net zero company by 2050 or sooner.Total, for its part, wants to be known as a 'global energy company', much like Equinor has been doing since it dropped the name Statoil.Improving energy efficiency, growing in natural gas, developing a low-carbon electricity business, sustainable biofuels, and investing in carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) technology are Total's key pillars of integrating climate in its strategy.In just two weeks, Total announced several renewables and batteries projects, from a pilot plant to manufacture European batteries for electric vehicles, to entering the Spanish solar market to develop nearly 2 gigawatts (GW) of solar projects, to expanding its partnership in India's renewables market.

        "title": "China Could Grant Tariff Exemptions On U.S. Oil And LNG",
        "content": "China has opened for applications for tariff exemptions on a number of U.S. products and commodities including crude oil and liquefied natural gas, Reuters reported today.Tariffs were blamed for the slump in U.S. oil and LNG exports to China, which is one of the biggest importers for both commodities. They also interfered with U.S. LNG companies' plans for new export capacity.After the signing of the Phase 1 trade deal between Washington and Beijing, many hoped that this would restore exports and even boost them significantly. The terms of the deal include the addition of U.S. energy exports worth some $18.5 billion this year and another $33.9 billion in 2021. The additional exports span the whole spectrum of fossil fuels and their derivatives, from crude oil and liquefied natural gas to various fuels as well as coke and coal.However, the coronavirus outbreak has seriously affected China's demand for oil and even LNG with virtually every industry in the country suffering the fallout from the large-scale quarantines and other travel bans.State refiners have cut their processing rates by a tenth this month and will be cutting additionally in March, according to OilX. The combined cut for PetroChina, Sinopec, and CNOOC for February came in at around 940,000 bpd, according to a Reuters report. Private refiners cut even more, with OilX calculating the cut at 25 percent.According to the American Petroleum Institute, however, even if there was strong demand for U.S. oil, the producers might not be able to satisfy it in accordance with the Phase 1 deal. Bloomberg earlier this month reported that the industry group had warned Washington that oil production capacity would need to be stretched quite a bit to fulfill the terms of the trade deal. Even so, the removal of tariffs would be a step in the right direction for U.S. oil and LNG producers as Chinese demand for their product will sooner or later recover.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Italy's Eni has announced a new oil discovery offshore Mexico, in the Sureste Basin, saying it could contain between 200 and 300 million barrels of crude.Eni is the operator and majority shareholder in Block 10 where the discovery was made, and has partnered with Lukoil and Cairn Energy subsidiary Capricorn.\"Mexico is a core country in Eni's strategy of future organic growth,\" the Italian supermajor said in its press release. \"The company is currently producing approximately 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed) from Area 1 and expects to reach a plateau of 100,000 boed in the first half of 2021. Eni is also planning an important exploration campaign in the other licenses held in Mexico.\"Eni's plans will fit in nicely with the Mexican government's state intention to boost the country's oil production. President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has promised that Mexico's oil output will hit 2.5 million bpd by 2024.Meanwhile, Pemex said it had begun awarding contracts for exploration and development at a number of priority fields to oilfield service providers.\"We invite the companies, who form consortia to carry out these comprehensive projects, from construction of the facilities, the drilling of wells, laying both marine and onshore pipelines ... and the consortium that offers the best price wins,\" chief executive Octavio Romero told media as quoted by Reuters.The state company has ambitious goals: discovering and developing 20 new oil and gas fields annually. This, according to analysts, is quite a bit on the over-optimistic side. Last year, the company identified 20 fields that it prioritized for exploration and development, but last month Natural Gas Intelligence reported that Pemex was behind schedule with their development, with just three of the 20 beginning production by the end of the year. The batch that the company is awarding contracts for now is the 2020 set of so-called priority fields.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "The International Monetary Fund cut Nigeria's economic growth outlook, citing the effect that the Chinese coronavirus outbreak has had on global oil demand.The revision follows a visit to the country by IMF officials, who said in a statement that Nigeria's economic recovery remains shaky and challenges abound.\"External vulnerabilities are increasing, reflecting a higher current account deficit and declining reserves that remain highly vulnerable to capital flow reversals,\" the IMF's Mission Chief for Nigeria, Amine Mati, said in the statement.\"Under current policies, the outlook is challenging. The mission's growth forecast for 2020 was revised down to 2 percent to reflect the impact of lower international oil prices. Inflation is expected to pick up, while deteriorating terms of trade and capital outflows will weaken the country's external position.\"Nigeria is currently producing less than 1.8 million bpd according to OPEC's latest monthly report. This is a lot less than it wants to produce, but the country is bound by its commitment to the OPEC+ club that is keeping production capped to stimulate prices, however unsuccessfully this has been going lately.At the same time, Nigeria is trying to boost its oil income in other ways. Last year, the country slapped Big Oil majors active in its oil industry with a lawsuit demanding $62 billion in back taxes payable under a legal stipulation from the early 1990s concerning the review of royalty rates based on international prices.Meanwhile, several oil majors are cutting their presence in Nigeria. Chevron, Total, and Exxon are all looking for buyers for some of their Nigerian assets. This does not bode well for Nigeria's oil industry unless it completes the sector reform that has been dragging its feet for two decades now. Then it could turn its attention to non-oil revenues, too.\"Non-oil revenue mobilization--including through tax policy and administration improvements--remains urgent to ensure financing constraints are contained and the interest payments to revenue ratio sustainable,\" the IMF's missions said in its statement.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Businesses and homes alike in the Iranian city of Tehran--along with several other cities--are in the dark--and in the cold--on Monday, the spokesman for the Iran Electrical Power Industry, Mostafa Rajabi Mashhadi, said on Monday while the country runs short of natural gas, according to RadioFarda.The cause of the blackouts are unknown and have led to speculation.When power cuts make the rounds in Iran, it's not often that it happens during the cold winter months. Tehran, too, is rarely included in power cuts or blackouts when they happen, because of security reasons.But Tehran is not exempt this time around.The emergency power cuts, which were not announced ahead of time, will be for two hours per day and will be carried out in the big cities, unless domestic gas use is cut by 10%.The power outages, along with being atypical for this time of year and extending to atypical Tehran, are suspect, according to RadioFarda, in that natural gas consumption in Iran--which is between 600 million cubic meters per day and 690 million cubic meters per day--is under the 800 million cubic meters of gas Iran is supposedly producing.Other oddities about the power cuts include the fact that Iran has been unable to get rid of some of its lower quality fuel oil that it normally sends to Iraq. This means its own power plants had to burn in recent months this lower-quality, higher-polluting fuel oil that it couldn't sell.This has led to some speculating that power cuts have an ulterior motive: to root out the cases of massive cyberattacks that have ripped through Iran's infrastructure since earlier this month. Some have suspicions that the source of the attacks were inside Iran.Other suspicions are that cyberattacks are behind the power outages, according to RadioFarda.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "The United States plans to provide up to US$1 billion to countries in Central and Eastern Europe to help them reduce their dependence on Russian oil and gas, as Washington also aims to prevent the completion of the Russia-led Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany.  \"And as a brand new statement today of our support for sovereignty, prosperity, and energy independence of our European friends, today I want to announce that through the International Development Finance Corporation, and with the support of our United States Congress, we intend to provide up to $1 billion in financing to Central and Eastern European countries of the Three Seas Initiative. Our aim is quite simple: It is to galvanize private sector investment in the energy sector to protect freedom and democracy around the world,\" U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said at the Munich Security Conference in Germany last week.Poland and the Baltic states, which oppose Nord Stream 2 and are trying to wean themselves off Russian energy dependence, will get funds, among others, according to German business daily Handelsblatt.While the U.S. intends to help promote private investment in central and eastern Europe's energy sector, it aims at the same time to stifle the Nord Stream 2 project, arguing that it would give Russia even bigger, and politically charged, leverage over its European gas customers.The U.S. Senate passed in December a massive defense bill that includes slapping sanctions on companies helping Russia's gas giant Gazprom to complete the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project.  The U.S. sanctions on the project have divided Europe, with Germany criticizing the U.S. interference in Europe's energy policies and projects.Following the announcement of the sanctions, Switzerland-based offshore pipelay and subsea construction company Allseas immediately suspended Nord Stream 2 pipelay activities.Russian officials claim that Russian firms can complete the project without the help of foreign partners, while U.S. Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette told Bloomberg in an interview during the weekend that Russian firms would not be able to complete the project in the Baltic Sea because they lack the technology to do it.

        "content": "Indian solar projects worth US$2.24 billion risk incurring time and cost overruns, including penalties for missing commercial operation timelines, if the coronavirus outbreak continues to impact Chinese solar panel exports, CRISIL Ratings, an S&P Global company, said on Monday.India sources around 80 percent of the solar modules it uses from China, as per CRISIL's analysis. The coronavirus outbreak, however, has disrupted Chinese production and exports of solar panels, solar modules, and other critical equipment for the solar industry.Due to factory shutdowns and production disruptions, exports of solar panels and other components out of China are being delayed, disrupting the supply chain of the solar power industries and affecting solar projects in Asia.   India, for example, already experiences delays in solar projects as imports of solar panels and solar modules from China are being delayed because of the coronavirus outbreak, developers and industry executives told Indian outlet Economic Times last week.Chinese solar equipment manufacturers have run factories at low utilization or have halted operations altogether due to the coronavirus outbreak.\"Indeed, even the modules already manufactured are facing delays in transit to project sites on account of precautionary restrictions on transit at ports,\" CRISIL said in its analysis.\"This puts at risk around 3 GW of solar projects auctioned between July and August, 2018, which need to meet their SCODs [scheduled commercial operation dates] by July 2020,\" Manish Gupta, Senior Director at CRISIL Ratings, said in a statement, noting that \"any delay at this stage can prove costly.\"If solar project developers in India target to meet the commissioning timelines, they could source more expensive modules from producers other than China. But in this case, the more expensive equipment--which could be 15-20 percent more expensive than China's--could reduce project returns by as much as 3 percentage points, CRISIL says.

        "content": "The oil industry's drive to show investors and the world that the sector is taking climate change seriously has reached the largest Russian oil producer, state-controlled Rosneft, which has just pledged to invest US$5 billion in environmentally-friendly projects within the next half decade.Rosneft will invest in projects to curb carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and for better utilization of associated petroleum gas, Reuters quoted Rosneft as saying on Monday.The Russian oil firm will also look to reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 8 million tons through 2022, according to Reuters.    Rosneft's commitment to invest in reducing carbon emissions comes days after UK-based supermajor BP, which holds nearly 20 percent in the Russian oil giant, announced plans to become a net zero company by 2050 or sooner.Last week, BP said that it aims to become a net zero company by 2050 or sooner in the latest pledge for net zero carbon emissions by an oil major. BP will also target to halve the carbon intensity of the products it sells by 2050 or sooner, joining other majors such as Shell and Equinor, which also aim to reduce the carbon footprint of the energy products they sell.Earlier this month, Equinor unveiled a plan to reduce the net carbon intensity, from initial production to final consumption, of energy produced by at least 50 percent by 2050. Shell has also set short-term targets for reducing the net carbon footprint of the energy products it sells.In Russia, Ruslan Edelgeriev, the senior adviser on climate change to President Vladimir Putin, said earlier this month that Russia needs to take urgent steps to fight climate change and reduce its dependence on fossil fuels. Russia--the world's fourth-largest greenhouse gas emitter after China, the U.S., and India--reduced the use of oil and coal in its energy mix by 4 percent between 2015 and 2018, while the share of natural gas has increased by 3.5 percent annually in each of those years, The Moscow Times quoted Edelgeriev as saying at a news conference in early February.Russia has a recent plan to 'adapt' to climate change until 2022, but Putin said at his annual press conference in December that \"nobody really knows the causes of climate change, at least global climate change.\"By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Qatar Petroleum has decided to postpone the start of expansion operations at its North Field, four unnamed sources told Reuters.The Qatari state energy firm was supposed to select foreign partners for the expansion soon, but it will delaying that, the sources said.Gas prices have been low for months amid a growing glut, falling demand for LNG in China, and still growing production, especially in the United States, casting a shadow over more than one project.Qatar's North Field, which it shares with Iran (South Pars), is the largest gas deposit in the world. Qatar had previously put a moratorium on any production expansion at the field, but two years ago it took many market players by surprise when it announced its plan to ramp up production. That decision was made as Australia began challenging--successfully--Qatar's number-one position as the world's largest LNG exporter and cheapest producer.Qatar Petroleum shortlisted half a dozen energy supermajors as partners for the expansion project and said it would announce their names in the first quarter of this year.Interestingly enough, Reuters recalls that last year Qatar Petroleum had also said it planned to up its initial production expansion plans from 40 percent more than current levels by 2027 to 60 percent more than current levels, which would come in at a total of 126 million tons of LNG, from 77 million tons currently.Meanwhile, the LNG price benchmark for Northeast Asia, according to S&P Global Platts has entered a bear market, slumping by over a third since the start of the year to an all-time low of $2.763 per Mmbtu as of last week.\"I think Qatar has decided to firm up the capex of the project before they go to international oil companies.

But I don't think it's as easy as saying, well, we're almost there, we're just going to finish it.\"Last month, after the U.S. levied sanctions on companies involved in the construction of the pipeline, Gazprom said it would complete the project on its own.\"The Nord Stream 2 project, which is already 94 percent complete, will be finished by the Russian side,\" the director-general of Gazprom Export told media in January.The twin pipe of Nord Stream will carry an additional 55 billion cu m of Russian gas to Europe and more specifically, Germany, whose gas hunger is growing as it shuts down coal and nuclear power plants. The controversy around the project centers on Ukraine: Nord Stream bypasses the main transit corridor of Russian gas and could, the Ukrainians and the EU fear, reduce Ukraine's gas transit revenues severely.There is also the geopolitical factor, of course, with the U.S. claiming that the additional pipe will increase Russia's influence in Europe to unacceptable levels.Despite Brouilette's upbeatness, not all agree that Nord Stream 2 can be stopped. According to experts, ICIS reported earlier this month, all difficulties around the projects are surmountable.\"Finishing the pipeline in the first quarter of 2021 could be realistic if Russia is able to restart construction works in the first half of 2020. But it will probably take up to twelve months to modernise the ship and this modernisation is intended to allow the ship to work on Sakhalin fields, actually not related to Nord Stream 2,\" a Poland-based energy consultant, Mateusz Kubiak from Esperis Consulting, told ICIS.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads from Oilprice.com:"

The ex-Yukos shareholders vs. Russia lawsuit has been dragging on in international courts for years.  Former Yukos owner and critic of the Kremlin, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested in 2003 and convicted of theft and tax evasion two years later. Yukos was broken up and sold off to state companies, including Rosneft. Khodorkovsky was released from jail in 2013 after Vladimir Putin pardoned him.In the meantime, former Yukos shareholders sued for compensation for the assets they lost, which they claim were expropriated by the Russian government. In 2014, the Hague-based Permanent Court of Arbitration ruled that Russia must pay US$50 billion to the ex-Yukos shareholders.Russia has refused to pay up, and two years later, in April 2016, The Hague District Court reversed the ruling of the Permanent Court of Arbitration on the grounds that it lacked jurisdiction to arbitrate in the case.The ex-Yukos shareholders appealed The Hague District Court's overturning of the ruling.Today, The Hague Court of Appeal reversed the 2016 ruling and reinstated the 2014 verdict of the Permanent Court of Arbitration that Russia pay US$50 billion to the former shareholders of Yukos.Russia can appeal today's ruling at the Supreme Court in the Netherlands, The Hague Court of Appeal said.Russia's Justice Ministry issued a statement on Tuesday, saying that it would appeal today's decision at the Supreme Court of the Netherlands.

On Tuesday, the United States slapped sanctions on a Geneva-based trading unit of Russian oil giant Rosneft, saying that the company Rosneft Trading has been helping Nicolas Maduro's regime to evade sanctions and to continue selling oil to keep the regime alive.Earlier this month, the U.S. warned companies doing business with Venezuela, including Reliance, Rosneft, and even Chevron, to \"tread cautiously towards their activities in Venezuela,\" because more sanctions on Maduro's regime would be coming.  Rosneft lifts Venezuelan oil under an oil-for-loan agreement for the loans it had extended to the Latin American country, and then sells the oil to Indian refiners that used to procure oil directly from Venezuela before the U.S. ramped up sanctions on Maduro's regime.Reliance says that its purchases of oil from Venezuela are being reported to Washington and are being allowed. Nevertheless, the Indian refiner reiterated that \"In its dealings with Rosneft and otherwise, Reliance will continue to act in compliance with U.S. sanctions and policy guidelines.\"Another Indian refiner, Nayara Energy, in which Rosneft holds a stake, also said it complies and would continue to comply with U.S. sanctions.  According to company and industry data and sources cited by Reuters, India was the top destination of Venezuela's oil in January 2020, taking 38.5 percent of the Latin American country's oil exports.

By 2025, total production from the Stabroek Block, according to Exxon, should be some 750,000 bpd.Such a rate of production would turn the tiny Latin American nation sandwiched between Venezuela and Suriname into quite a large player on the international oil market. However, given the current price environment, the demand patterns and the chances of this environment becoming chronic, these production goals may not be hit when planned.In the meantime, however, oil news from Guyana will draw traders' attention: just when OPEC-- or at least its de facto leader, Saudi Arabia--is cutting to the bone to keep prices from falling further, here comes a new producer with significant ambitions in oil production.Guyana's addition to the ranks of non-OPEC producers could speed up the demise of the cartel as the only trend-setter in global oil--a position already shaken by U.S. shale as well as Brazil, which also has lofty production goals for the future.Back in 2000, the U.S. Geological Survey estimated the total reserves of oil and gas contained in the Guyana-Suriname Basin at up to 13.6 billion barrels of oil and 32 trillion cu ft natural gas. It will this year reassess the 2000 figures and chances are the recoverable portion of these reserves thanks to much more advanced extraction technology.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Offloading operations for fuel vessels in a port in Tripoli have been halted, Libya's National Oil Corporation (NOC) announced on Tuesday, according to Reuters, as military forces led by Khalifa Haftar were responsible for projectiles striking near a highly explosive LPG tanker.\"Fuel vessels have evacuated urgently from Tripoli port today after projectiles struck meters away from a liquified petroleum gas (LPG) tanker discharging in the port,\" a statement on NOC's website read.The LPG tanker and a gasoline tanker have since left the port and relocated to safer waters.NOC is now looking for alternative ways to supply fuel to its capital.Haftar forces said earlier in the day that they attacked a sea port in Tripoli as the violence escalates and the timing of getting its oil industry back on its feet in doubt. The total losses so far resulting from the mess that is the current blockade of oil ports and oil pipelines is in excess of US$1.7 billion, with production below 125,000 bpd, according to NOC--a figure that is a far cry from the 1.2 million bpd Libya was producing in early January.The blockade is the latest in the long-hard fight for control of the country and its oil revenues between the Libyan National Army, affiliated with the eastern government, and the Government of National Accord, which has been recognized by the UN. All oil revenues go into accounts controlled by the GNA and NOC, but the LNA is looking to change that with the blockade.Yesterday, the Prime Minister of the UN-recognized Government of National Accord said that Libya is facing a financial disaster if Haftar's Libyan National Army does not lift the oil port blockade.NOC's chairman Mustafa Sanalla warned that if the blockade is not soon lifted, Libya could lose all of its oil production.

        "content": "Washington levied sanctions Tuesday on a Rosneft subsidiary--Rosneft Trading, in the latest round of The United States' maximum pressure campaign on the Nicolas Maduro regime in Venezuela, according to senior Trump administration officials.\"Today we sanctioned Russian-owned oil firm Rosneft Trading S.A., cutting off Maduro's main lifeline to evade our sanctions on the Venezuelan oil sector. Those who prop up the corrupt regime and enable its repression of the Venezuelan people will be held accountable,\" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a tweet.Rosneft said of the new sanctions that they were an \"outrage\".The sanctions block all US assets of Rosneft Trading and its director, Didier Casimiro, and will extend to anyone doing business--any business--with Rosneft Trading.The Trump administration referred to Rosneft Trading as the \"gravest violator\" of the imposed limits on Maduro as much of the Western world wants him ousted--and fast. Specifically, the US is alleging that Rosneft has sent oil tankers to Venezuelan ports with the location tracking system disabled and has transferred Venezuelan oil in the middle of international waters to ship on to Asia and West Africa.It is also possible that recent talks between Rosneft and Venezuela that would see Rosneft take over some PDVSA assets was enough to spook the Trump administration into further action.The extra sanctions added today serve not only as a warning to Rosneft, but will apply even greater pressure on Maduro, who is desperately clinging to power no matter what painful economic measures the US throws his way. Maduro's staying power is due in part to Rosneft's support.The additional sanctions, which include a 90-day wind down period for companies doing business with Rosneft, received bipartisan support in the US.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "OPEC producer Kuwait aims to have 100 percent of the executive, technical, and supervisory jobs in its oil sector held by Kuwaiti nationals by early 2021, Middle East Monitor reports, quoting Kuwait's Supreme Petroleum Council.The decision is aimed at \"preventing the appointment of expatriates for the sector's main jobs,\" a senior Kuwaiti energy official told Al-Araby Al-Jadeed, as carried by Middle East Monitor.  Kuwait's government will also look to increase the number of domestic firms operating in contracts with state-held firm Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC) by 80 percent, according to the official.Kuwait will start to gradually carry out the plan for 100-percent Kuwaitis at top oil jobs in the second half of 2020, aiming to reach its goal before the start of the country's next financial year in April 2021. Nearly three years ago, Kuwait announced plans to increase its crude oil production capacity to 4.75 million bpd by 2040, compared to a current capacity of 3.15 million bpd.This past Sunday, Kuwait's Oil Minister Khaled al-Fadhel announced the start of trial production at the two fields that Saudi Arabia and Kuwait share and that hadn't pumped oil in nearly five years due to a dispute between the neighboring countries. Total production is expected to reach 550,000 bpd by the end of the year, al-Fadhel said.  Kuwait's plans to raise production capacity in the long term is at odds with estimates from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) that the oil-rich Middle East producers and exporters need urgent reforms to boost non-oil revenues and non-oil economic growth, if they were to keep the immense wealth they have amassed from oil in the past few decades.Kuwait has a huge sovereign wealth fund, which could help it stave off the total wealth depletion until 2052, according to the IMF.But Kuwait is heavily dependent on oil--the oil and gas sector accounts for about 40 percent of its GDP and a whopping 92 percent of export revenues, according to OPEC.

        "content": "Israel's energy and environment ministries have agreed that the minister of energy will not grant new licenses to companies to explore for and mine oil shale in the country, due to environmental concerns, Israel's Ministry of Environmental Protection said on Tuesday.As Israel aims to move to more environmentally friendly energy sources, it will no longer issue new licenses for oil shale because of the ecological and environmental impact of such mining projects, the two ministries said.Israel is believed to have deposits of oil shale--a rock containing significant amounts of organic material in the form of kerogen--lying under 15 percent of its territory.  The country, however, will not be extending a license to Rotem Amfert, a unit of Israel Chemicals, for oil shale exploration at Mishor Rotem after 2021, according to the energy ministry.The ministry will also review two already issued licenses based on the new environmental criteria, it said.Rotem Amfert, which operates a small power plant at Mishor Rotem with the oil shale it is mining from the nearby area, sought a few years ago permission to explore what it believed were huge oil shale resources in the Negev area, but has met stiff opposition from environmentalists.Currently, Israel is pinning its hopes in the energy sector on its huge offshore natural gas resources.The Leviathan gas field--discovered in 2010--together with other fields discovered offshore Israel in the past decade such as Tamar, Karish, and Tanin, is expected to help Israel become energy independent.A senior official at Noble Energy said at the beginning of December that Leviathan was set to begin gas supply to the local market within three weeks and to start exports to Egypt and Jordan shortly after that, in a major milestone for the energy landscape in Israel and the Eastern Mediterranean.  Noble Energy announced first gas at Leviathan on December 31, while Israeli natural gas exports to Egypt started in the middle of January.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

Trafigura complies with all applicable sanctions and will comply with the requirements of these latest rules within the wind-down timeline that has been set by the general license,\" a Trafigura spokesman said.Trafigura is unlikely to be the only company leery of doing business with Rosneft Trading, and more pain may be in store for the company that stands accused of allowing Venezuela's oil trade continue despite the United States' ongoing maximum pressure campaign designed to force Nicolas Maduro to step down. Rosneft Trading's support of PDVSA and Maduro is, according to the United States, part of the reason that Maduro has been able to cling to power for so long.Tuesday's sanctions block all US assets of Rosneft Trading, and extend to anyone doing business with Rosneft Trading, but do allow for a 90-day wind down period for companies currently doing business with Rosneft Trading.The United States was considering sanctions on Rosneft back in September, after July and August showed Rosneft to be the largest marketer and buyer of Venezuelan oil, which it then sold onto China and India, helping them to avoid sanctions.In June last year, Rosneft Trading was responsible for shipping 100% of all the gasoline that Venezuela imported that month through ship-to-ship transfers totaling 1.7 million barrels. And in July, according to Refinitiv Eikon data, Rosneft Trading took 40% of PDVSA's oil exports, while Vitol and Trafigura had stopped handling Venezuelan crude.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "title": "Andurand's Hedge Fund Lost Big In Volatile Oil Markets",
        "content": "The main oil-focused hedge fund of one of the best known oil traders, Pierre Andurand, incurred an 8-percent loss in January, the Financial Times reported on Friday, quoting three people with knowledge of Andurand's fund performance.  Pierre Andurand manages Andurand Capital Management, one of the few oil-specializing hedge funds still out there. Andurand's fund was a big winner of the oil price volatility in 2014 and 2016, but after that it suffered two consecutive years of annual losses in 2018 and 2019.According to FT's sources, Andurand's losing streak extended into January this year.Last month, volatile crude oil prices and the much lower-than-expected premium of diesel prices over high-sulfur fuel oil (HSFO) prices caught many traders by surprise, according to FT.Before the January 2020 International Maritime Organization's (IMO) rules that only 0.5-percent or lower sulfur fuel oil be used in ships, traders and market analysts had expected diesel prices to jump and HSFO prices to slump because of the new regulation. It turned out, however, that refiners were well prepared for the shift and produced enough diesel, but they produced less HSFO. Lower HSFO supplies led to the premium of diesel over HSFO to drop by nearly a third last month.The wild swings in crude oil prices in January also led to a wild ride for oil traders at the start of this year. In early January, prices rallied after the U.S. killed Iran's most powerful and visible military leader, Qassem Soleimani, in Iraq. Brent Crude prices exceeded US$70 a barrel for the first time since May last year. WTI Crude prices also rose to their highest level since May 2019, rising above US$64 a barrel early last month.In the second half of January, however, oil prices started sliding amid the coronavirus outbreak in China, as traders began to panic that the outbreak is inflicting the worst demand shock to the oil market since the 2008-2009 financial crisis.

        "content": "New Yorkers may have to pay more for electricity from renewable sources after the Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions issued a series of four orders that call for providers of wind, solar, and energy storage--all subsidized--to meet the price floor in the state's capacity market, the regulator said in a news release.According to FERC, the orders will protect competition in the New York Independent System Operator's capacity market \"by improving the buyer-side market power mitigation rules to send accurate price signals to markets and to ensure adequate supplies for consumers.\"Reuters reports, however, that the move could make it harder for the environmentally ambitious state to hit its targets for renewable energy. The state has plans to get 70 percent of its electricity from renewables sources by 2030 and 100 percent by 2040.According to environmentalists, the FERC orders will effectively support fossil fuels in their competition with wind and solar, by forcing the latter to pay more in the capacity market.According to power plant operators, on the other hands, the generous subsidies for wind and solar affect them negatively by reducing, Reuters writes, what they receive in capacity and energy markets.\"Competitive electricity markets, which were originally designed to provide reliable service at the least cost, are now at an inflection point,\" said the president of the New York Independent System Operator, Rich Dewey. \"The wholesale markets must now accommodate state policies; not conflict with them.\"These ambitious goals have put the state's government at odds with the utility sector. Bans on new gas pipelines led to National Grid announcing that it will stop connecting new customers for lack of capacity to bring in the gas needed for the power plants last year.In response, Governor Andrew Cuomo accused the company of either over-relying on a single gas pipeline to supply the necessary additional fuel for its power plants to respond to growing energy demand, or it \"deliberately defrauded the people of the state by not developing or pursuing existing supply options to force approval and reliance on a private pipeline to further their business interests at the cost of the consumer.\" By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

The Saudi side, however, never confirmed or denied the attack.The Yemeni war, which began in 2015, has led to the worst humanitarian crisis in the world at the moment, and there is no end in sight, with the fight between the Houthis and the Saudi-led coalition recently intensifying around the key port city of Hodeida.Even so, Yemen is producing some oil: as of late January, the rate was 55,000 bpd, S&P Global Platts reported, a fraction of what the country used to produce before the war broke out but still a 40-percent increase from early 2019.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

The company remains bullish on the Gulf of Mexico.Gulf of Mexico oil of the sour medium crude variety--including the Mars grade from Shell and BP's Gulf of Mexico platform--filled some gaps left by the absence of heavy oil from Venezuela, which US refiners used until about March 2019, when US refineries stopped importing from the sanctioned Latin American country.With supplies of Mars tightening as US refiners turned to it, starved of Venezuelan crude oil, the price of the grade increased in early 2019, but has since fallen off.The current pipeline has the capacity to move between 400,000 and 600,000 barrels per day of oil produced in Mississippi Canyon area to the LOOP salt dome caverns in Clovelly, Louisiana. In the Mississippi Canyon area, the Mars pipeline transports oil from the Olympus and Mars A platforms, as well as from the Medusa and Ursa pipelines. It is also connected to the Amberjack pipeline.BP Midstream Partners LP--Shell's partner in the pipeline, announced in September that it was considering expanding the Mars crude oil pipeline to accommodate additional oil from offshore fields. Its current mainline capacity, according to BP's website, has a mainline capacity of 400,000 barrels per day.At the time, BP said it would look to expand that to include new volumes from Vito and Power Nap Gulf of Mexico fields.Shell owns 71.5% of the Mars pipeline, while BP owns the remaining 28.5%.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

Apart from a program to divest non-core assets, Petrobras is also selling eight refineries as part of the divestment plan and in an agreement with regulators to open the refining market.Last year, Petrobras sold US$16.3 billion in non-core assets, it said in its webcast presentation of the 2019 results.The company, which is the world's most indebted oil firm, reduced its gross debt by US$24 billion last year. At the end of 2019, gross debt was US$87 billion, down from US$111 billion at the end of 2018.Total investments, including acquisition bonuses for participation in Brazil's oil auctions, came in at US$27.4 billion. Excluding investment in bids, Petrobras invested US$10.7 billion last year, focusing on exploration in the pre-salt area and on production development.Petrobras's oil production averaged 2.172 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2019, exceeding its target production of 2.1 million bpd, with record production in the pre-salt area.Earlier this month, Petrobras announced that it had set another production record in the fourth quarter of 2019, producing more than 3 million bpd of oil equivalent throughout the period. In Q4 2019, oil and gas production reached 3.025 million barrels of oil equivalent per day, which represents \"a new landmark in Petrobras history, as we break through the 3.0 MMboed barrier in a quarter for the first time,\" the company said last week.

Faced with a slump in global oil demand due to the coronavirus outbreak, the producers of the OPEC+ production cut pact were considering moving the March 5-6 meeting to some date in February, in order to react to the depressed demand and the slide in oil prices. The OPEC+ group's joint technical committee (JTC) issued a proposal on February 8 that the producers extend the cuts as-is until the end of 2020 and deepen those cuts in the second quarter in response to the fact that the coronavirus \"has had a negative impact on oil demand and oil markets.\"Russia, however, has taken time to review the proposal and has been avoiding for weeks now a direct reply to the proposal.On Thursday, minister Novak dodged again a specific reply and reiterated that Russia hasn't made a decision yet and continues to hold discussions with its partners, as carried by Russian news agency TASS.Related: EIA Cuts 2020 Oil Demand Forecast By 378,000 BpdEarlier this week, Novak held separate telephone conversations with Saudi Arabia's energy minister, Abdulaziz bin Salman, and with Iran's oil minister Bijan Zanganeh, and discussed the cooperation in the OPEC+ format in both conversations, Russia's energy ministry said.Novak said today he doesn't see any need to move the planned meetings to an earlier date, stressing that the situation is still highly uncertain and fast-changing, and it makes sense to wait to see how it will be two weeks from now. Asked whether Russia is ready to join other OPEC+ producers in deeper cuts, Novak only said that \"we will monitor how the situation evolves,\" and noted that oil prices have already risen by 10 percent from their recent low.OPEC's Secretariat has sent the oil producing countries the official invitations for the meeting, which will be held on March 5-6, as planned, sources from the delegations told TASS on Wednesday.

Meadow Creek East, Suncor says, will have a nominal production capacity of 40,000 bpd but it could be boosted to twice that at some point. Both projects are seen to have productive lives of at least 40 years.Now that the company has the approval of the provincial government, it could begin the permitting process. However, it will be a while before it makes the final decision on Meadow Creek West: it said on its website it has deferred this decision to 2023 at the earliest. The reason for the postponement is that Suncor is now focusing on expanding production at its already operating projects as this is less costly than starting up a whole new project.The approval of the Meadow Creek West project comes as many in the industry await with bated breath Ottawa's decision on another oil sands project. Teck Resources' Frontier oil sands project, valued at some $15.7 billion (C$20.6 billion), will produce some 260,000 bpd of crude oil at peak rates and will have a productive life of 40 years.The federal government should announce its decision for the project by the end of this month, although the federal Environment Minister last month suggested in a comment that the government could choose to delay the decision.\"Cabinet can make a decision to approve, it can make a decision to reject, it can make a decision to delay,\" Jonathan Wilkinson said in late January.The government is being torn between the interests of Alberta, a major contributor to the country's GDP and the province where the Liberals lost all seats last year because of their anti-oil policies, and the green lobby, which insists on the Trudeau cabinet taking its emissions commitments more seriously.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "The American Petroleum Institute (API) estimated on Wednesday a larger than anticipated crude oil inventory build of 4.16-million barrels for the week ending February 14, compared to analyst expectations of a 2.494-million-barrel build in inventory.In the previous week, the API estimated a larger than expected build in crude oil inventories of 6-million barrels, while the EIA's estimates were even more bearish, reporting a large build of 7.5-million barrels for the week.Oil prices were trading significantly up on Wednesday prior to the data release, with traders planning on a swift end to the current coronavirus crisis that has created demand problems in the world's largest importer, China. Other bullish factors for oil on Wednesday were the sanctions that the United States announced on a Rosneft subsidiary for dealing in Venezuelan crude oil--a significant measure that will put additional pressure on Venezuela.At 3:36 pm EST on Wednesday the WTI benchmark was trading up on the day by $1.26 (+2.41%) at $53.55--up nearly $4 per barrel week on week. The price of a Brent barrel was also trading up on Wednesday, by $1.22 (+2.12%), at $58.73--nearly $5 up week on week.The API this week also reported a draw of 2.67 million barrels of gasoline for week ending February 14, after last week's 1.1-million-barrel build. This week's large gasoline build compares to analyst expectations of a 435,000-barrel-build for the week.Distillate inventories were down by 2.63 million barrels for the week, compared to last week's 2.3-million-barrel draw, while Cushing inventories rose by 4.21 million barrels.US crude oil production as estimated by the Energy Information Administration showed that production for the week ending February 7 resumed its previously hit all-time high of 13.0 million bpd.At 4:39 pm EDT, WTI was trading at $53.43, while Brent was trading at $58.61.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "China's passenger car sales tumbled by 92 percent year on year in the first two weeks of February, due to the coronavirus outbreak, which is also expected to result in a significant decline in Chinese trade growth and to reduce foreign investments into China this quarter.According to data from the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA), cited by South China Morning Post, daily retail sales of passenger cars slumped to just 4,909 vehicles between February 1 and February 16, compared to 59,930 vehicles sold in the same period last year.  \"Very few dealerships opened in the first weeks of February and they have had very little customer traffic,\" the association said.The coronavirus outbreak and the extended Lunar New Year holiday period because of it have severely damaged car sales in the world's biggest auto market, which were already faltering even before the virus outbreak.Due to the coronavirus, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) expects the country's car sales to fall by more than 10 percent in the first half of 2020 and by some 5 percent for the full-year 2020, in case the outbreak is contained before April, CAAM's executive chairman Fu Bingfeng told Reuters in an interview last week.In late January and in February, very few people were looking to purchase a passenger car in China, while major local and global automakers temporarily suspended production in the country. Tesla's newly opened Shanghai factory had to shut down for a few weeks because of government-mandated temporary closures due to the coronavirus outbreak.With China's car sales and industrial activity coming to a standstill, the country's trade figures for January and February are expected to be particularly gloomy because of the industrial and logistics activity slowdown.China has canceled the release of January trade data and is set to reveal the figures together with February data in early March.The January-February trade data is expected to show a sharp decline in China's export and import growth rate, Li Xingqian, head of foreign trade at the Ministry of Commerce, told South China Morning Post.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "The US may have dealt Venezuela another blow by sanctioning Rosneft subsidiary Rosneft Trading last week, but as the company dealing the most oil from Venezuela is hamstrung, another Rosneft subsidiary has stepped up to the plate to fill the gaps, Bloomberg said on Monday.Now, TNK Trading International SA--a company controlled by oil giant Rosneft--seems to be upping its loadings of Venezuelan crude oil, scheduled to load more than 14 million barrels of it in January and February this year. By comparison, 2019 saw TNK Trading load 5 million barrels total for the year.Rosneft Trading hasn't loaded any Venezuelan oil since January 29, although it wasn't sanctioned until February 18.The timing of Rosneft Trading's apparent drop off in Venezuelan loadings, uptick in TNK Trading's Venezuelan loadings, and the latest sanctions have unclear meanings--but the US was mulling these sanctions on Rosneft back in September.Last week was seen by many as a warning by the United States to parent Rosneft, the latter of which has extensive oil operations in sanctioned Venezuela. Still, the US has stopped short of sanctioning the Rosneft, who stands accused of propping up the socialist regime of Nicolas Maduro.  But once that card is played, there is little else to ratchet up to should the need arise.Trafigura responded last week to the new round of Rosneft Trading sanctions by saying it would wind down its dealings with Rosneft Trading by May. But it is unclear how effective the sanctions are, if another of Rosneft's companies picks up the slack.Last week's sanctions block all US assets of Rosneft Trading, and extend to anyone doing business with Rosneft Trading, but do allow for a 90-day wind down period for companies currently doing business with Rosneft Trading.In addition to loading Venezuelan crude, which it sells to other buyers afraid of running afoul of US sanctions, Rosneft Trading did a fair bit of fuel deliveries to Venezuela as well.

        "content": "The coronavirus outbreak could hit global oil demand growth more than currently expected, the head of the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Tuesday, adding that the agency could additionally trim its oil demand growth projections.  \"We certainly see the lowest oil demand growth in the last 10 years and we may need to revise it ...downwards,\" the IEA's executive director Fatih Birol told Reuters at an energy conference in London today.In a sign that the coronavirus outbreak is spreading to international events, the International Petroleum Week in London this week is being held regularly, but many participants have canceled receptions and events at the conference due to the outbreak. Major international oil traders and refiners have canceled networking events, sources told Reuters last week.The comments from the head of the Paris-based agency come a day after oil prices plunged by more than 4 percent as the coronavirus spread outside Asia, threatening global economic growth and raising fears of additional loss of oil demand growth.Earlier this month, the IEA said in its Oil Market Report (OMR) that the coronavirus outbreak would lead to the first quarterly contraction in global oil demand in more than 10 years. The IEA slashed its 2020 oil demand growth forecast by 365,000 bpd to just 825,000 bpd--which would be the lowest oil demand growth since 2011.Now, according to the IEA's Birol, even this lowered projection could be further revised downwards due to the coronavirus outbreak.Earlier this month, OPEC also slashed its global oil demand growth forecast for 2020, expecting the coronavirus outbreak to weigh heavily on fuel demand in the world's oil demand growth driver, China. OPEC slashed its oil demand growth estimate by 230,000 bpd from last month's assessment and now sees global oil demand growth at just below 1 million bpd this year--at 990,000 bpd.The EIA also cut its oil demand growth forecast by 378,000 bpd for this year due to coronavirus outbreak.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Norway's Equinor has shelved an oil exploration project in the Great Australian Bight, becoming the third supermajor to give up on the Bight amid a challenging environment and strong environmentalist opposition.Australia's ABC reports that the Norwegian company concluded that the plan it had for the Bight was less commercially competitive than other locations.\"We have received bids for the drilling rig, the helicopters, the supply base -- the cost for these activities is just too high and too expensive to go ahead and drill the well,\" said the manager of Equinor Australia.BP was the first oil major to give up on the Bight, after it spent millions on preparatory work while awaiting the approval of the $600-million project from Australia's oil industry regulator, Nopsema. The watchdog made BP's life difficult by twice rejecting the supermajor's drilling plans for the Bight, insisting it disclose more details about its environmental protection program. Eventually, BP gave up and left, handing the reins to Equinor.At the time, the Norwegian company was upbeat about its prospects in the Bight.\"We have a good understanding of the geology in our licence area, based on high-quality 3D data analysis. We believe there could be an active petroleum system within our permit area and we are now positioned to test this potential under favourable market conditions for exploration drilling,\" Equinor's vice president of exploration for Australia said at the time.There has been no oil and gas exploration in the Great Australian Bight since 2003, and all the wells drilled in the region previously have come up dry. However, Wood Mackenzie estimates suggest that the area could hold 1.9 billion barrels of crude oil and natural gas.Equinor, used to operating in harsh climatic environments, could have been better suited than BP and Chevron--which left the Bight soon after BP--to try its hand at the Great Australian Bight, yet it seems the challenge proved too great for the Norwegian company, too.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

Chief executive Elon Musk at the time predicted the model will sell better than the other three combined.At the release of the fourth-quarter results of the company, Musk said Tesla had increased the range of the Model Y to 315 miles and called it the most energy efficient electric SUV in the world.A cheaper, shorter-range, version of the Model Y, at US$39,000 was to be made available to customers in the spring of 2021. Its battery would have the capacity to last for 230 miles.Teslarati earlier this month reported Model Y cars were spotted on Tesla's test track at its Fremont factory ahead of the start of deliveries.Last year, Tesla sold 367,500 cars globally, which was a record high for the company and more than its sales for 2017 and 2018 combined. This year, according to some forecasts, sales could top half a million cars, and some of this increase--if it materializes--will come from sales of the Model Y.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Rosneft has allocated April deliveries of the ESPO crude blend to commodity trader Trafigura instead of to China's CEFC, suggesting that Russia's largest producer may have altered or even terminated the terms of a crude delivery deal with the Chinese company, four sources familiar with the issue told Reuters on Monday.Rosneft has a five-year deal with China's CEFC to supply between 2018 and 2022 volumes of the ESPO crude grade, which is popular with the independent Chinese refiners, commonly known as 'teapots.'While the reason for leaving none of the ESPO supplies for April to the Chinese firm was not immediately clear, Reuters' sources suggest that there may have been changes to the terms of the oil supply deal between Rosneft and CEFC, which had expressed interest to buy a large stake in the Russian oil giant three years ago.Qatar Investment Authority paid some US$4.2 billion (3.7 billion euro) for a 14.16-percent stake in Rosneft, thus becoming the third-largest single shareholder after the Kremlin and BP, the Russian company said in November 2018.  The deal with the sovereign wealth fund of Qatar was the final episode of a saga in which a little-known Chinese company until that point, CEFC China, said in September 2017 that it had agreed with a consortium of Glencore and Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) the terms of sale of the consortium's 14.16-percent stake in Rosneft.However, in March 2018, Chinese authorities started investigating the chief executive of CEFC China Energy, Ye Jianming, on suspicion of economic crimes. The investigation was part of a wider crackdown on private Chinese businesses after President Xi Jinping's government warned that no Chinese billionaire, no matter how well-connected, is safe from scrutiny and investigation.The investigation and troubles of CEFC China Energy raised concerns over the agreement that it had signed to buy 14 percent in Rosneft from Glencore and QIA.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Tesla's soaring stock this year was the key driver of the returns of several hedge funds based in Asia which had either bought Tesla shares at the dip last year or held the EV maker's stock for years.According to executives at the hedge funds and a person with knowledge of the returns who spoke to Bloomberg, Hong Kong-based funds Optimus Prime Asset Management and CloudAlpha Capital Management, as well as Singapore's Golden Horse Fund Management Pte, saw their bets on buying and/or owning Tesla shares pay off in January, when Tesla's stock rally contributed the most to the funds' returns. Optimus Prime Asset Management returned 14.5 percent in January, mostly thanks to its Tesla holdings, the person familiar with the fund's operations told Bloomberg. The fund held Tesla's stock even when the EV maker's shares were under intense pressure in 2018 and early 2019 and when analysts were questioning the company's survival due to the consistent lack of profits.For CloudAlpha Capital Management, the Tesla stock rally contributed 5.5 percent to the return of its global technology hedge fund last month, according to CloudAlpha's newsletter to clients cited by Bloomberg.Singapore-based Golden Horse Fund Management also benefited from the Tesla rally as its Global Macro Discretionary Fund returned 2.2 percent in January, half of which thanks to Tesla, although Tesla shares accounted for just 3 percent of the fund's holdings.Related: Aramco To Invest $110 Billion In Huge Gas FieldAt the end of January, Tesla easily beat market expectations and posted a profit for Q4, a second consecutive quarter in which the company beat outright analyst expectations and defied skeptics.Tesla's stock continued to rally in February, hitting an all-time high closing price of US$917 last week.  One of the big losers in the Tesla share price rally was Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund which had sold nearly all of its Tesla stock at the end of 2019, missing out on this year's stock surge and on billions of U.S. dollars in potential gain.The Saudi Arabian fund held more than 8,277,080 shares in Tesla as at the end of Q3 2019, while its holding in Tesla was just 39,151 shares as at the end of 2019, according to the fund's filing with the SEC.

In that context, it is now evident that there is no constructive path forward for the project.\"Teck's decision to shelve the Frontier project comes ahead of this week's deadline for the federal government to either approve or reject the project, with uncertainty rife as to what path Ottawa would choose in a bid to appease environmentalists and energy industry supporters alike.Earlier this month, the federal government even prepared an aid package for Alberta in case the Teck Resources project did not go through, according to a Reuters report.\"Rejecting Teck without providing Alberta something in return would be political suicide,\" one source said. This means the government must be prepared to compensate the oil province to dull the pain.Yet Teck's decision is not a surprising one. The company warned two years ago that \"There is uncertainty that it will be commercially viable to produce any portion of the resources,\" referring to the Frontier project, conceived and planned in a much better oil price environment more than a decade ago.Alberta's Premier Jason Kenney, however, saw something fishy with the decision.\"The timing of the decision is not a coincidence,\" Kenney said in a statement as quoted by the Financial Post. \"This was an economically viable project, as the company confirmed this week, for which the company was advocating earlier this week, so something clearly changed very recently.\"By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "The United States should step in and help lift the blockade of Libyan oil ports that has decimated the country's oil production, the chairman of the National Oil Corporation, Mustafa Sanalla said during a meeting with the U.S. ambassador.\"US Ambassador Norland and I agreed that the oil and gas sector must be allowed to operate for the benefit of all Libyans, as it represents the only income for state. That means ending the blockade, which is doing severe damage to the economy of country,\" Sanalla was quoted as saying by Libyan media.\"I am hopeful that the US will continue their efforts to broker peace so that Libya's economy can slowly rebuild and work towards prosperity for all Libyan people. We urgently need US leadership to help end the oil embargo, not just to avoid a financial crisis, but to prevent major damage to national infrastructure,\" Sanalla also said.A group of tribal paramilitary organizations blockaded Libya's oil ports in January as part of the ongoing offensive of the eastern government-affiliated Libyan national Army against the Government of National Accord based in Tripoli.The blockade has led to a slump in oil production from over 1.2 million bpd to less than 200,000 bpd and a warning, earlier this month, from the Prime Minister of the GNA that if it continues, the country will face financial disaster.Related: Is Tesla Really The Emerging 'Energy King'?\"The continuation of the shutdowns will result in a catastrophic financial crisis,\" said Fayez Serraj. \"Losses from the oil shutdowns have exceeded $1.4bn. The figure is increasing every day.\"Indeed, in late January, NOC's Sanalla told Bloomberg that Libya could lose all of its oil production if the blockade was not lifted soon, and the latest production figures suggest that output may indeed be heading for zero, with no free storage space left to stock oil from still-producing fields.The latest production update from NOC says that Libya is producing just 124,000 bpd because of the continued blockade. What's more, an LNA attack on the port of Tripoli has prompted four vessels to leave the port to avoid getting hit by a missile after one narrowly missed an LNG carrier that was unloading its cargo at the time, Lloyd's reported.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

The world needs to get to the point at which it will no longer add to the stock of greenhouse gases, and reducing emissions to net zero \"is the only way to go,\" Shell's chief executive Ben van Beurden said this summer, calling on businesses to work together to move faster in addressing climate change.  However, Shell's core business is and will continue to be oil and gas for the foreseeable future, van Beurden has said.Last year, Shell has also set short-term targets for reducing the net carbon footprint of the energy products it sells.  Shell has significant commitments to reduce its carbon footprint, although BP's pledges include \"a broader set of announcements,\" Shell's Wetselaar told The Times.Last week, BP said it would aim to become a net zero company by 2050 or sooner, but it drew criticism over the lack of specifics about how it would achieve its goal.Commenting on BP's target, Shell's Wetselaar told The Times:\"Once we understand them we will think about them but at the moment I don't think we need to get into an arms race of CO2 targets -- it's much more important we execute our strategy to bring down our net carbon footprint.\"BP has yet to set binding short-term targets to cut its carbon footprint--something that the Anglo-Dutch firm has already done, Shell's executive noted.

        "content": "Today in \"news that affects all electric vehicle manufacturers but definitely not Tesla stock\", Audi has announced that it has suspended production of its e-Tron electric SUV effective February 20 and won't resume until some point early this week. The suspension has been a resolve of \"resolving production issues\", which are mainly attributed to bottlenecks in battery supply, according to Business Insider. Audi uses battery cells that are made by LG Chem and ran into similar battery supply chain issues last year. Making sure companies have a steady battery supply has become a priority for many EV makers. Names like Jaguar and Hyundai have also faced similar supply chain issues with batteries in the past. Other automakers, like GM, Toyota and Tesla are investing in joint ventures or building their own battery manufacturing facilities.As one example, GM and LG Chem announced a deal last year where they would both invest a cumulative $2.3 billion into a battery factory in Ohio. Audi said that the company sold roughly 26,400 of the SUVs last year but wouldn't comment on delivery estimates for the upcoming year. The company reported sales of 5,369 e-Trons in the Americas last year, which represented 2.4% of sales in the region.Regardless, it is yet another issue in the EV world that real auto manufacturers are subject to - and yet another one that, for some reason, doesn't seem to catch up with Tesla. How can things at Tesla always be just fine and dandy while other auto manufacturers have to deal with these real world supply chain issues?Last year, for instance, Tesla's Elon Musk said that Panasonic was \"holding back production\" of the company's Model 3 by not making enough batteries. The company's stock has tripled since then, while Tesla has made no material progress in producing its own batteries. By Zerohedge.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "China's crude oil imports could drop by as much as 15 to 20 percent on the year in February, due to the coronavirus outbreak and the slump in domestic fuel demand, the Global Times reported on Thursday, citing a researcher at the China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC).The lower demand with all the travel restrictions to contain the outbreak could lead to Chinese imports dropping by up to 8 million tons (or around 200,000 bpd) this month compared to the same month last year, Wang Lining, deputy director of the Oil Market Research Department at CNPC's Economics and Technology Research Institute told the Global Times.According to Refinitiv Oil Research, as cited by Reuters, crude oil imports in China are set to stand at 10.53 million bpd in February, down from imports of 10.69 million bpd in January--an expected drop of 160,000 bpd month on month.  March is also expected to see depressed demand and lower crude oil imports.But if the coronavirus epidemic is contained in March, China's oil imports could rebound in April and May, because of recovering gasoline and diesel demand, CNPC's researcher Wang told the Global Times.Due to weak fuel demand and depressed industrial activity, Chinese refiners--from the biggest refiner in Asia, Sinopec, to the independent refiners in Shandong--have cut refinery runs, while commodity trading houses and oil majors are scrambling to find spot buyers for crude oil outside China.  Refinery run rates at the largest Chinese companies CNPC and Sinopec have slumped by 15 percentage points since January, while the independent refiners' utilization rates have plummeted by 28 percentage points as compared to the refinery operations before the Chinese New Year, Wang told the Global Times. While refiners have cut run rates, China's fuel exports are booming amid battered domestic demand, analysts and trade sources tell Reuters as higher Chinese exports flood the Asian market, which sees depressed demand from the outbreak itself.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

While the size of this debt load may not be that worrying in itself, spread across 52 loan deals inked by 30 sub-Saharan African countries and 22 Latin American states, the fact that little detail about the terms of these loans has been made public is worrying, the NRGI report notes.Of the total 52 loan deals, 38 were made with Chinese state policy banks, seven were made with commodity trading companies, four were made with other Chinese state companies, one came from South Korea, another from Russia's Rosneft, and the last one from Nigeria, the report said.\"While these loans have often provided much-needed infrastructure, such as roads and hydro-dams, in many cases they have led to crippling levels of debt and the risk of losing collateral that is itself worth more than the value of the loan,\" the lead author, David Mihalyi, said. \"Urgent changes are needed and that starts with transparency. Borrowers and lenders must allow for greater scrutiny of lending terms to ensure that these loans are sustainable and serve the interests of the people and the countries they are supposed to benefit.\"China has over the last decade emerged as the largest importer of African mineral resources, its economy driving a constant rise in demand for these resources while domestic supply falls. The country is also investing heavily in Latin America with a focus on natural resources. The size of the loans granted to countries in these two key regions further highlight the size of China's bet on international expansion, one of whose aims is securing the long-term supply of vital natural resources.

        "content": "Aramco has reportedly started the preparation process for the international leg of its listing, which most expected to be years away. According to unnamed sources that spoke to Bloomberg, the timeline has been shortened.However, the sources added the international listing is unlikely to take place this year because of the price outlook for oil and the unfavorable market conditions overall.The Aramco listing became something of a legend with the odds of it happening ever shifting constantly as oil prices moved up and down and demand and supply outlooks got revised time and again.The international leg of the listing, always part of original plans, was a challenge, too, because the venues considered for this leg were very few and each had problems attached to it: litigation dangers in New York after the 9/11 legislation allowing the U.S. to sue Saudi nationals for their role in the attacks, legislative and industry opposition in London, and the \"not New York or London\" factor in Hong Kong and Tokyo.Finally, Aramco listed at home last December, after the Saudi government spent $2.3 billion on preparing the deal, which lived up to expectations of being the largest IPO in history, valuing the Saudi energy giant at $1.7 trillion, just $300 billion shy of the $2-trillion valuation Crown Prince Mohammed was after.However, the domestic listing of the company attracted overwhelmingly local investors, both institutional and retail, and, according to reports at the time, some of these were effectively bullied into buying Aramco shares. This made analysts even more doubtful about Aramco's chances in an international venue, but the plans are still there. If the Bloomberg sources are to be believed, the process has been set in motion, which means we will be hearing more about the Aramco IPO in the coming months.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "BP will leave three U.S. energy trade associations, including the main refining lobby group, the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers (AFPM), due to differences over climate policies, the UK-based oil supermajor said on Wednesday.   BP will be withdrawing its membership from AFPM, the Western Energy Alliance (WEA), and the Western States Petroleum Association (WSPA), after finding in an in-depth review that those three associations don't have climate policies aligned to BP's goals and its support to the Paris Agreement.    BP has just set an ambitious target to become a net zero company by 2050, but has drawn criticism due to the lack of specifics on how it would achieve this goal.A week after new CEO Bernard Looney took over from Bob Dudley as BP's boss, BP unveiled earlier this month a plan to achieve net zero carbon footprint across BP's operations on an absolute basis by 2050 or sooner. The oil major also aims to halve the carbon intensity of the products it sells by 2050 or sooner, joining other international companies such as Shell and Equinor which also target to reduce the carbon footprint of the energy products they sell.BP has reviewed the climate policy alignment of 30 key trade associations to which it belongs and will review the policies of the associations in which it continues to be a member in around two years' time.\"Our priority is to work to influence within trade associations, but we may publicly dissent or resign our membership if there is material misalignment on high-priority issues,\" chief executive Looney said in a statement on Wednesday.BP is not the first European supermajor to quit the main U.S. refining group AFPM. In April last year, Royal Dutch Shell said it would leave the association because of 'material misalignment' in climate-related positions, becoming the first major oil and gas group to quit the refining lobby over climate policy disagreements.

The crude marketing companies of OPEC producers Iraq and Kuwait have asked Asian buyers if they would be willing and able to buy more oil for loading in March, the sources told Reuters, in a sign that the Middle Eastern oil producers are grappling with growing oversupply amid the slump in Chinese crude oil demand.Fears of a global economic slowdown due to the spreading of the virus outside Asia are also battering oil prices, which hit budget revenues of the oil suppliers in the Middle East.

For travelers returning from Iran, the lockdown areas in northern Italy, the Hubei province in China, and the specially designated zones in South Korea, the UK government advises people to stay indoors and avoid contact with other people even if they do not show flu-like symptoms.The coronavirus outbreak is spreading to international energy events, and the International Petroleum Week in London this week is being held regularly, but many participants have canceled receptions and events due to the outbreak. Major international oil traders and refiners have canceled networking events, sources told Reuters last week.The spread of the coronavirus outside China and Asia has become a major concern for the equity and oil markets in recent days, with oil prices set for a fourth consecutive day of losses early on Wednesday and WTI Crude trading below $50 a barrel at $49.50 as of 7:00 a.m. EST.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

At the time, some saw the move as a sort of punishment for Al-Falih who, according to sources familiar with the workings of Riyadh, has been opposed to the initial public offering of Aramco.Yet the removal of Khalid Al-Falih from the top energy job was only part of a wider reshuffle that saw the energy ministry split into two: energy, and industry and mining. Initially, Al-Falih remained head of the new energy ministry but was later removed.The official was one of the drivers of the first OPEC+ production cut agreement that for the first time involved not just OPEC but a producer as large as Russia. Al-Falih also produced the \"Whatever it takes\" approach to oil price control, which, however, seems to have stopped working.His replacement, Abdulaziz bin Salman, is quite a lot more straightforward in his approach to the media, signalling a determined approach to oil policies, too.\"We did not run out of ideas, we haven't lost our phones and there are always good ways of communicating through conference calls and technology is very helpful,\" the new minister said earlier this week in response to questions about OPEC's next moves in the price control offensive.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

Earlier reports said the foreign companies to which PDVSA has more or less handed control over oil production were hiring private security forces to guard the fields.\"This is a demonstration of the insecurity we face, which is also present in the oil fields and undoubtedly impacted production,\" a union leader for oil workers, Jose Bodas, told Reuters in an interview. Bodas also said the tanker had been en route to the Jose port where it was due to load crude oil and added this was the first attack of this sort in eastern Venezuela.Venezuela produced around 733,000 bpd last month, according to OPEC's secondary sources, almost unchanged on December. This is down from an average of 793,000 bpd for 2019 and from more than 1.35 million bpd in 2018 before the U.S. launched its sanction offensive against Caracas.Earlier this month President Nicolas Maduro declared what he called an energy emergency, saying the government will take urgent steps to fight the crisis although he was short on the details.\"I declare an emergency situation in the oil industry by constitutional and presidential decree in order to take urgent and necessary measures to ensure the country's energy security and protect the industry from imperialist aggression,\" Maduro said.The Venezuelan president went on to blame the situation on the U.S. saying, \"The sanctions, the blockade - I will not accept any more excuses.

Meanwhile, OPEC has not responded to the crisis with more output cuts, as Russia continues to drag its feet.As the coronavirus panic sets in, it is unclear just how much of an affect these weekly inventory moves will have on prices.At 1:45 pm EST on Tuesday the WTI benchmark was trading down on the day by $1.29 (-2.51%) at $50.14--down more than $3 per barrel week on week. The price of a Brent barrel was also trading down on Tuesday, by $1.34 (-2.40%), at $54.43--up more than $4 week on week.The API this week also reported a small build of 74,000 barrels of gasoline for week ending February 21, after last week's 2.67-million-barrel draw. This week's small build compares to analyst expectations for a 2.245-barrel-draw for the week.Distillate inventories were down by 706,000 barrels for the week, compared to last week's 2.63-million-barrel draw, while Cushing inventories rose by 411,000 barrels.US crude oil production as estimated by the Energy Information Administration showed that production for the week ending February 14 held fast at its all-time high of 13.0 million bpd.At 4:43 pm EDT, WTI was trading at $49.84, while Brent was trading at $54.10.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "China's top oil supplier and the world's largest oil exporter, Saudi Arabia, will be cutting its crude exports to the world's top oil importer by at least 500,000 bpd in March because of a slump in refinery demand amid the coronavirus outbreak, Reuters reported on Thursday, citing sources familiar with the plans.  China's typical intake of Saudi crude oil is between 1.8 million bpd and 2 million bpd, according to Reuters' sources.Last year, Saudi Arabia significantly raised its crude sales to the China, boosting its exports by 47 percent and beating Russia for the top Chinese supplier spot for the first time in four years.However, the coronavirus outbreak has significantly slowed fuel demand in China as the authorities imposed travel restrictions in an effort to quickly contain the outbreak. City lockdowns, domestic travel restrictions, and thousands of canceled flights to and from China have weighed on Chinese gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel demand over the past month.Due to weak fuel demand and depressed industrial activity, Chinese refiners--from the biggest refiner in Asia, Sinopec, to the independent refiners in Shandong--have cut refinery runs, while commodity trading houses and oil majors have scrambled to find spot buyers for crude oil outside China.  Chinese oil refiners have cut their daily run rates further, to around 10 million bpd last week--the lowest level since 2014, according to industry insiders who spoke to Bloomberg.While refiners have cut run rates, China's fuel exports are booming amid battered domestic demand, analysts and trade sources tell Reuters as higher Chinese exports flood the Asian market, which sees depressed demand from the outbreak itself.The slowdown in China's industrial activity is causing the worst shock to oil demand in over a decade, Jeff Currie, global head of commodities research at Goldman Sachs, said in an interview on Bloomberg earlier this month.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

Its report laid out a laundry list of complaints with the leftist proposals, which would not only see a total ban on fracking, but which would also stop federal natural gas and oil leasing. In addition to the $7 trillion cost, the API suggests in its report that it would increase America's reliance on foreign fossil fuels and increase costs for farmers and homeowners, Reuters said.The Democrat candidates, however, suggest that the extraordinary measures is what is necessary to address the \"climate crisis\" by transitioning to greener energy.Their solution, along with coming up socking it to taxpayers for $7.1 trillion, in part, includes retraining any displaced oil and gas workers.But the Democrat's timing on the energy revolution couldn't have come at a worse time for US oil producers who will likely fight to the death, after a few years of bang-up production in the United States gave the nation a new level of energy dependence that has freed it--in part--from OPEC's puppet-master ways of choking oil output among its members to manipulate market prices, at the literal expense of US consumers.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

Construction works began last month and the project is scheduled to be operational in 2024.The company leading Seagreen is UK utility SSE, which has been looking for shareholding partners in order to share the substantial costs and risks associated with the wind farms because it will not be fully supported by the UK government.Last year, Bloomberg recalls, SSE secured a 15-year contract with the government for 454 MW of power produced by the Seagreen farms, which left the output from the rest of the installation to be sold on the open market.Total, like most other supermajors, has ambitious plans in the renewable energy area.

The U.S., however, slapped sanctions on Rosnef's Geneva-based trading unit, saying that the company Rosneft Trading has been helping Maduro's regime to evade sanctions and to continue selling oil to keep the regime alive.Reliance Industries and Nayara Energy, both of which have financial exposure to the U.S. banking and financial systems, have vowed full compliance with the sanctions, to avoid running afoul of the U.S. Administration and become targets of secondary sanctions themselves.Reliance hasn't ordered any Venezuelan cargoes for April, while Nayara Energy will stop processing Venezuelan crude after getting its contracted volumes in March, Reuters' sources said.Firms have until May 20 to wind down business with the Rosneft trading unit, and India looks intent to comply with all sanctions guidance.Cutting off Venezuelan exports to what was its biggest market in January would further complicate Maduro's oil exporting business.The U.S. Administration is now looking to further increase the pressure on Venezuela's oil industry and exports.\"The President has made a decision to push harder on the Venezuelan oil sector and we're going to do it. And what we're telling people involved in this sector is that they should get out of it,\" Elliott Abrams, U.S. Special Representative for Venezuela, told Reuters in an interview on Monday.

The oil major also aims to halve the carbon intensity of the products it sells by 2050 or sooner, joining other companies such as Shell and Equinor, which also target to reduce the carbon footprint of the energy products that they sell. Eni's plan today includes upstream production growth at an annual rate of 3.5 percent up to 2025, and a decline in oil and gas production after that, mainly for oil. By 2050, gas production would account for around 85 percent of Eni's total production, the company said.  Apart from higher gas production and projects for forest conservation and CO2 capture and storage, Eni aims to significantly boost its position in renewables. The company expects to have installed renewables capacity of 3 GW by 2023 and 5 GW by 2025, while installed renewables capacity is set to jump to 55 GW by 2050, with developments mainly in OECD countries.\"We have designed a strategy that combines economic sustainability with environmental sustainability and we have done so by defining an action plan based on technologies - existing or developed in-house - that we know how to implement. This will allow Eni to be a leader in the market supplying decarbonised energy products and actively contributing to the energy transition process,\" Eni's chief executive Claudio Descalzi said in a statement.

Baron is a long-term investor and his funds bought almost all Tesla shares that they currently hold between 2014 and 2016, at a total cost of US$355 million.

In 2024, Tesla's revenue could jump to US$100 billion-US$125 billion, and the company could be worth US$300 billion-US$400 billion, compared to US$150 billion currently.The billionaire also says that Tesla, which sold 367,000 vehicles last year, could be selling 2 million EVs per year in two years, and ultimately--at least 10 million cars a year.In 2030, Tesla's revenues could hit US$1 trillion, Baron said.\"By then, Tesla could be worth $1.5 trillion, ultimately putting it among the largest and most valuable companies in the world,\" the investor told Barron's.This year, Tesla's stock has rallied and tripled in value since the summer. At the end of January, Tesla easily beat market expectations and posted a profit for Q4, the second consecutive quarter in which the company beat outright analyst expectations and defied skeptics. Tesla's stock continued to rally in February, hitting an all-time high closing price of US$917 last week.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

Interestingly enough, the government of Canada's oil heartland expects the average for WTI during fiscal 2020-21 to be $58 a barrel, rising to $63 in fiscal 2021-22.At the moment, WTI is trading below $50 a barrel, pummeled like Brent crude by the fallout from the coronavirus, or Covid-19, epidemic. The chances of the U.S. benchmark rising by almost $10 per barrel at the moment seem rather slim.Alberta, however, is optimistic. It expects the budget deficit this year to narrow to US$5.1 billion (C$6.8 billion), down from US$5.58 billion (C$7.5 billion) for the current fiscal year.The government also expects GDP to pick up this year and grow at a rate of 2.5 percent after remaining largely unchanged in 2019-20. Over the next five years, GPD growth, according to Alberta's government, will even accelerate to 2.8 percent, with the economy moving \"from recovery into expansion\".Related: Oil Prices Set For Worst Weekly Plunge In Four YearsThe optimism of the Albertan government deserves respect. The oil industry, which is the province's main source of revenue, has been plagued by now chronic pipeline shortage problems and low oil prices. To add to this, environmentalist opposition has been growing, earlier this year erupting into railway blockades in protest against the Coastal GasLink pipeline.Earlier this month, Teck Resources decided to shelve a major oil sands project that would have added 260,000 bpd to Alberta's oil production. The industry has been complaining about the unfavorable investment climate for years as well, blaming government agencies for making it unfavorable with their regulatory requirements. The current government has clearly stated the oil and gas industry will be its priority, so perhaps the optimism about the next fiscal year is based on planned measures to encourage more investment in oil and gas.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "The trading arm of an independent Chinese refiner went into receivership this week, sending ripples of worry across the industry that more pain is yet to come.Reuters reported the news, citing a KPMG official after the audit major was appointed receiver for Hontop Energy, a unit of Shandong-based Tianhong Chemical Co.\"Hontop continues to be run by the existing management. The receiver has been appointed over specific charged assets which mainly relate to one trade transaction financed by [Singapore bank] DBS. Their involvement is limited to realizing DBS' security and to discharge DBS' debts,\" a partner for a law firm acting on behalf of the oil trading company said.Bloomberg noted that the news would elevate fears about the financial health of the so-called teapots: the independent refiners that became the driver behind China's growing imports of crude oil.\"Many of the teapots are already on a credit redflag list of banks in Singapore,\" the news agency quoted an Oxford Institute for Energy Studies executive as saying. \"The virus has certainly tightened cash-flows and exacerbated banks' concerns.\" Michal Meidan, director of the institute's China Energy Programme said.Earlier this week, Reuters reported that international banks were suspending credit lines for some independent oil refiners worried about the growing risk of defaults across industries because of the coronavirus epidemic.According to unnamed industry sources, at least three private Chinese refiners have had credit lines to the tune of $600 million suspended by banks including French Natixis, Dutch ING, and Singapore DBS Group Holdings.According to Bloomberg, however, the private Chinese refiners' financial trouble is unlikely to affect overall Chinese demand for oil. What is affecting it severely, however, is the continuing epidemic, which has now spread on three continents, fueling new concern about the global economy, with some even warning that a recession was on the way as the virus outbreak could turn into a pandemic.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "The Trump Administration is unlikely to grant U.S. supermajor Chevron another waiver to operate in Venezuela as the United States is increasing pressure on Nicolas Maduro's regime, Bloomberg reported on Thursday, quoting people familiar with the issue.Chevron, the last remaining U.S. oil firm with operations in Venezuela, last month obtained a waiver extension by the U.S. Administration to continue operations in the Latin American country for another three months until April 22.  However, the U.S. has stepped up sanctions pressure on Venezuela's oil industry since January, and Chevron's waiver probably will not be extended beyond April, Bloomberg's sources said.  At the beginning of February, the U.S. warned companies doing business with Venezuela, including Rosneft and even Chevron, to \"tread cautiously towards their activities in Venezuela,\" because more sanctions on Maduro's regime would be coming.  Two weeks later, the United States slapped sanctions on a Geneva-based trading unit of Russian oil giant Rosneft, saying that the company Rosneft Trading has been helping Maduro's regime to evade sanctions and to continue selling oil to keep the regime alive.Now the U.S. Administration is looking to further increase the pressure on Venezuela's oil industry and exports.\"The President has made a decision to push harder on the Venezuelan oil sector and we're going to do it. And what we're telling people involved in this sector is that they should get out of it,\" Elliott Abrams, U.S. Special Representative for Venezuela, told Reuters in an interview on Monday.The Trump Administration is considering whether to extend the waiver to Chevron in light of the increased sanctions pressure on Venezuela, Abrams told Reuters, but declined to comment on specifics.Earlier this month, Bloomberg reported that officials at the Trump Administration are back discussing a plan to oust Maduro by potentially persuading people in his ruling party to turn against him and agree to a power-sharing agreement with the Venezuelan opposition.

        "title": "Mexico's Pemex Widens Q4 Net Loss To $9 Billion   ",
        "content": "Mexican state-owned oil firm Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) reported on Thursday a net loss of US$8.77 billion (169.8 billion Mexican pesos) for the fourth quarter of 2019, widened from a loss of US$8.1 billion (157.3 billion peso) for the same period of 2018, mainly due to lower crude oil exports.For a decade and a half, Pemex and Mexico have been grappling with continuously falling crude oil production. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has been a vocal critic of the energy reform of his predecessor Enrique Pena Nieto, who opened in 2013 Mexico's oil and gas sector to private investment for the first time in seven decades.Lopez Obrador seeks a greater role for Pemex in reversing the downward trend in Mexican oil production and is criticizing the energy reform and the foreign oil firms for failing to do so.     Lopez Obrador and Pemex have grand plans for reversing the production decline. The company's new strategic plan aims to guarantee \"the country's energy security and sovereignty\" and targets to raise crude oil production to 2.48 million bpd by the end of this administration's term in office--the end of 2024.  To compare, Pemex's crude oil and condensate production averaged 1.712 million bpd in the fourth quarter of 2019, down from an average production of 1.741 million bpd for the fourth quarter of 2018, according to Pemex's results released today.The lower production in Q4 2019 versus Q4 2018 was the result of natural decline of production at some mature fields, Pemex said, noting that the decline rate slowed down thanks to production from newer oilfields.Pemex's total revenues in Q4 2019 slumped by 22 percent compared to Q4 2018, with both domestic and foreign revenues down, due to lower prices of Mexican export blends, lower gasoline and diesel prices in Mexico, and lower volumes sold domestically and overseas.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "OPEC could agree further oil production cuts at its meeting in Vienna this week, even if Russia decides not to join them, unnamed sources in the know told Reuters.In February, OPEC proposed further cuts of 600,000 bpd to make up for demand loss amid the coronavirus outbreak, but Russia was reluctant to agree, noting there was no guarantee the deeper cuts would stimulate demand for oil, therefore pushing prices up.Now, the cartel is talking about even deeper cuts, of up to 1 million bpd. It would put the total reduction at 2.7 million bpd, and this is not including the decimated Libyan oil output, currently at a little over 120,000 bpd, down from over 1.2 million bpd at the start of the year.\"Saudi Arabia wants to hold prices from falling, but Russia is still not agreeing. So the only way might be for OPEC to cut alone, which will not send a good signal to the market,\" one source said, while another added, \"There should be a cut, there is no other option.\"If Russia decides to sit this one out, the chances of further cuts improving prices would be slim. However, they would take care of the supply/demand balance at a time when all major energy authorities, including OPEC itself, are revising downward their demand forecasts for the year.The EIA last month cuts its demand outlook by 378,000 bpd, after OPEC cut its own by 230,000 bpd and the IEA revised its demand forecast down by 365,000 bpd. The IEA also expects a dip in demand this quarter, and a sizeable one, at 435,000 bpd.Oil prices, in the meantime, are sliding. On Friday, Brent crude dipped below $50 for a while before rebounding in Asian trade today. At the time of writing, the international benchmark was trading at $51.38, with West Texas Intermediate at $46.13 a barrel, both up by more than 3 percent from Friday.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

OPEC and its allies are holding a technical meeting before full ministerial OPEC and OPEC+ meetings on Thursday and Friday to decide how to address the depressed oil demand due to the coronavirus outbreak.  The market started pricing in a significant cut this week, with oil prices rallying on Monday and early on Tuesday, on hopes that the OPEC+ coalition will come up with a unified position about deeper cuts in Q2, despite Russia's reluctance to sign up for more cuts.Russia continues to refuse to announce its position regarding deeper cuts by OPEC+, but over the weekend Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested that Moscow will continue to cooperate with OPEC, even though it sees current oil prices as \"acceptable.\" The OPEC+ group's joint technical committee (JTC) issued a proposal early last month that the producers extend the cuts as-is until the end of 2020 and deepen those cuts in Q2 in response to the fact that the coronavirus \"has had a negative impact on oil demand and oil markets.\"Last week, OPEC's leader Saudi Arabia was said to be asking members of the OPEC+ group to consider an additional collective cut of 1 million bpd--that is 400,000 bpd higher than the initial proposal of the panel.  According to reports, some OPEC members are leaning toward a 1-million-bpd cut, especially after oil prices slumped amid heavy selling last week.\"OPEC+ will need to surprise the market with the level of cuts if they want any chance of pushing prices higher,\" ING strategists Warren Patterson and Wenyu Yao said on Tuesday.

        "content": "Wells Fargo has become the third major U.S. bank to stop financing new oil and gas projects in the Arctic, joining the likes of Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan in a global drive of banks declining financing for the dirtiest fossil fuels and for projects in sensitive areas.In an updated policy guide on corporate responsibility, Wells Fargo says that \"Wells Fargo does not directly finance oil and gas projects in the Arctic region, including the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) - part of a larger 2018 risk-based decision to forego participation in any project-specific transaction in the region.\"Wells Fargo will not extend credit or facilitate transactions for coal projects involving mountain top removal (MTR) or to coal producers engaged in MTR mining, the bank says in its Environmental and Social Risk Management (ESRM) framework and policies.Referring to Arctic oil, Wells Fargo's spokesman David Kennedy said in an emailed statement to Anchorage Daily News:  \"Our policy applies only to project finance in the region.\"\"We have ongoing business relationships with numerous companies involved in the oil and gas industry in the Alaska Arctic region and expect to continue those relationships long into the future,\" Kennedy added.Wells Fargo is now the third U.S. bank that has vowed to stop financing new oil and gas projects in the Arctic region over the past three months.In December, Goldman Sachs said it would decline financing for new Arctic oil exploration and production and for new thermal coal mine development or strip mining, which made the investment bank the U.S. bank with the strongest restrictions on funding fossil fuels.Last week, JPMorgan Chase said it would not provide project financing or other forms of asset-specific financing for new oil and gas development in the Arctic. The bank also pledged not to provide lending, capital markets, or advisory services to companies whose revenues come mostly from coal, and to phase out its remaining credit exposure to such companies by 2024.

This overhang in capacity will continue to pressure refiners' margins, the industry group said.\"For the full year and longer term, overcapacity will still be the dominant issue in the industry,\" the vice chairman of the CPCIF said.Total refining capacity on the world's largest oil importer stood at 17.2 million bpd as of the end of 2019.The coronavirus outbreak will not help matters, either. Demand for fuels has taken a severe beating since the start of the year, with refinery run rates falling to the lowest in six year last month, at around 10 million bpd, from close to 13 million bpd last year.Chinese refiners, at least the private ones, are also facing a credit crunch because of the epidemic. According to unnamed Reuters sources, at least three private refiners, or teapots, have had credit lines to the tune of $600 million suspended by banks including French Natixis, Dutch ING, and Singapore DBS Group Holdings.Even in this environment, the industry will continue building refineries this year as well, raising the already excessive total by another 3.1 percent, or 27 million tons.\"We have growing concerns over the overcapacity issue,\" CPCIF's vice chairman, Fu Xiangsheng, said. \"With the launch of the integrated refining projects, production and sales rose but profits fell.\"The immediate outlook is not too good, again because of the coronavirus epidemic.

Chevron will continue to maintain its annual capital spending in a narrow range of US$19 billion-US$22 billion through 2024, maintaining strict spending discipline, unlike its U.S. rival ExxonMobil, which has been spending a lot to grow production.  The disciplined approach to capex, investments in lower-risk and shorter-cycle projects, and a drive to cut costs are expected to boost Chevron's adjusted operating cash flow per share by 9 percent each year through 2024, the company said.\"We believe our advantaged portfolio and capital efficiency enable us to grow cash flows and increase returns without relying on rising oil prices. Through continued execution of our strategy, Chevron has the potential to distribute $75 - $80 billion in cash to shareholders over the next five years,\" Wirth said in a statement.   In the upstream, Chevron will continue to rely on the Permian, the expansion of its Kazakhstan oil project, and on deepwater Gulf of Mexico opportunities in the long term.\"Our long-term production profile is strong and growing. We have a deep unconventional resource base and expect to see sustained production over 1 million barrels per day in the Permian through 2040 at relatively flat activity levels,\" Jay Johnson, executive vice president, Upstream, said.Related: Why Hydrogen Stocks Are SoaringChevron has the lowest cash flow breakeven price among Big Oil, at around US$51 per barrel Brent Crude, the U.S. major said in its investor presentation. In the annual meeting with analysts, Chevron couldn't leave out the energy transition theme, although the two U.S. supermajors haven't been as vocal about cutting emissions as their European rivals.Chevron said it would increase renewables to support its business, lower its carbon intensity cost efficiently, and invest in potential breakthrough technologies such as alternative fueling infrastructure and carbon capture.Chevron's analyst day today will be followed by an Exxon Investor Day on March 5. The two U.S. supermajors will have a lot of questions from analysts to answer to such as what the sub-$50 WTI Crude price means for their Permian business and how they would win in a future of low-carbon energy.

Since its inception, Waymo has logged in 20 million miles on public roads with its ride-sharing service in Arizona and in California. Last year alone, the company logged 1.45 million miles just in California.\"We've always approached our mission as a team sport, collaborating with our OEM and supplier partners, our operations partners, and the communities we serve to build and deploy the world's most experienced driver,\" said Waymo's chief executive, John Krafcik. \"Today, we're expanding that team, adding financial investors and important strategic partners who bring decades of experience investing in and supporting successful technology companies building transformative products.\"The self-driving car segment of the auto industry seems full of promise, but it has been slow in taking off not least because of stringent regulations. Yet the segment is growing. Last year, none other than Ford and Volkswagen inked a joint venture deal on self-driving cars to challenge Waymo and others working in that area. The JV would invest $7 billion in an autonomous vehicle platform dubbed Argo AI.Autonomous cars have been slow in coming because of the technological challenges to develop artificial intelligence so complex that it can entirely take the wheel out of a human's hands.

        "content": "After Teck Resources canceled its oil sands project, even approved oil sands projects could be difficult for Canada's companies to bring online in the short term until more pipeline capacity becomes available and the federal regulatory process becomes clearer, analysts tell The Canadian Press.Last month, Teck Resources said it had withdrawn its application for a regulatory review of the Frontier oil sands project.The federal government of Canada was set to decide by the end of February whether to approve Teck Resources' Frontier Project--a truck-and-shovel oil sands mine located between Fort McMurray and Fort Chipewyan in northeast Alberta.But Teck Resources didn't wait for the federal government's official response and dropped the project estimated to be worth US$15.6 billion (C$20.6 billion).According to Phil Skolnick, an oil sands analyst at Eight Capital, Teck Resources' decision shows that companies with already approved projects and plans for expansion of existing facilities have an advantage over new projects, especially new projects for open mining of bitumen.The low oil prices make the economics of oil sands mining projects more difficult to work, Skolnick told The Canadian Press.\"I think the era of multibillion-dollar oilsands projects is definitely over,\" Benjamin Israel, a fossil fuels analyst for the environmental Pembina Institute, told The Canadian Press.Related: Russia's Oil Production Rises Ahead Of OPEC+ Meeting\"Under any scenario that has us addressing climate change, business-as-usual cannot continue and, simply, won't be profitable in the long run as the market shifts toward lower-carbon products,\" Simon Dyer, executive director at the Pembina Institute, said last week, commenting on Teck Resources' decision to ditch the project.Canada's oil sands production could grow in the future, Eight Capital's Skolnick told The Canadian Press, but the growth will depend on additional pipeline takeaway capacity, which has been the key hurdle to Canada's oil industry growth in recent years.Upstream capital investment in Canada's oil sands is expected to grow this year from 2019 for the first increase in capital expenditures in five years, the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP) said earlier this year, attributing its rosier expectations for 2020 to \"a more competitive economic environment\" due to some recent policies that the Alberta government has undertaken.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "title": "World's Top LNG Importer Has More Bad News For Markets",
        "content": "Demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG) in the world's top importer of the fuel, Japan, is set to take additional hit this month as the country ordered the closure of all schools from March 2 until late in the month, and as corporations ask staff to work from home amid the coronavirus outbreak.Japan is currently the number-one importer of LNG and its electricity demand is expected to drop, and power demand accounts for most of the country's LNG demand, analysts told Bloomberg on Monday.The coronavirus outbreak is dealing a heavy blow to the three biggest import markets of the super-chilled fuel--Japan, China, and South Korea. The world's top three importers of LNG are also the three hardest hit countries in the coronavirus outbreak.The demand slowdown amid the outbreak comes on top of a milder winter in North Asia and high LNG inventories across Asia this season. All these factors have sent LNG prices to multi-year lows.  Last month, China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC), the country's largest LNG importer, was said to have declared force majeure on deliveries of LNG cargoes and will not be honoring some of the deliveries because of the deadly coronavirus outbreak.Even before Chinese importers started invoking force majeure on LNG deliveries, LNG prices had hit a decade low due to warmer winter weather in many parts of Asia, booming new LNG supply--especially from the U.S. and Australia--and slower import growth in China.Average LNG spot prices for April delivery were around $3 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) last week, stable on the previous week, but traders are concerned that demand would further slump in coming weeks, traders told Reuters.Although super-low LNG prices could encourage some demand, the seasonal high inventories in Asia and China's shaky LNG demand leave \"no other markets big enough or sophisticated enough to absorb a lot of LNG quickly,\" Simon Flowers, Chairman and Chief Analyst at Wood Mackenzie, said last month. \"Asia's other big markets, like Japan and South Korea, will see only limited coal to gas switching in power due to rigid market structures, existing inflexible LNG contracts and regulated pricing,\" he added.

Two weeks later, the United States slapped sanctions on a Geneva-based trading unit of Rosneft, saying that the company Rosneft Trading has been helping Maduro's regime to evade sanctions and to continue selling oil to keep the regime alive.Now the U.S. Administration is looking to further increase the pressure on Venezuela's oil industry and exports.\"The President has made a decision to push harder on the Venezuelan oil sector and we're going to do it. And what we're telling people involved in this sector is that they should get out of it,\" Elliott Abrams, U.S. Special Representative for Venezuela, told Reuters in an interview last week.The Trump Administration is considering whether to extend the waiver to Chevron in light of the increased sanctions pressure on Venezuela, Abrams told Reuters, but declined to comment on specifics.

        "content": "South Sudan continues to spend oil revenues in advance and its oil sector continues to lack transparency, according to a UN report that was made public recently.One of the newest countries in the world, South Sudan, broke from Sudan in 2011, taking with it around 350,000 bpd in oil production. But then civil war in South Sudan broke out in 2013 that further complicated oil production.  Currently, South Sudan pumps around 180,000 barrels of oil per day (bpd) and it aims to grow its production in the future.According to a report by the Panel of Experts on South Sudan drafted in November 2019 but made public recently, \"There has been a continued lack of transparency in the oil sector. The Ministry of Petroleum has not ended the practice of pre-sale financing arrangements for South Sudanese oil, despite the recommendations of the International Monetary Fund.\"Last year in March, the IMF warned South Sudan to immediately stop contracting expensive and nontransparent oil advances. South Sudan had taken loans from Chinese companies with the promise to repay them with proceeds from future oil revenues--from oil it has yet to get out of the ground.The UN report found that the African oil producer continues with the practice to strike pre-sale financing arrangements with little transparency.\"The Panel was unable to verify the financial liabilities of the Government related to oil advances, cargoes and repayment terms because the Government has not released current data on oil sales or published its marketing report, in accordance with the stipulations in the Agreement on transparency and accountability,\" the UN report said.South Sudan's Ministry of Petroleum published last month a report, saying that it is \"trying to increase transparency in the country's oil and gas sector, specifically concerning the financial aspects.\"\"All this information is now available, and everyone will have access to it,\" the ministry said at the end of February.

        "content": "PetroChina, the largest importer of natural gas, has declared a force majeure on all imports, including of liquefied natural gas, unnamed sources told Reuters, without providing any details except that the move was prompted by the coronavirus outbreak.\"The supply cuts will fall on suppliers proportionately but LNG suppliers will have a lesser impact versus those on piped gas\", one of the sources said.China imports 40 percent of the natural gas it consumes, with 70 percent coming via pipelines from Russia, Kazakhstan, other Central Asian states, and Myanmar. The rest comes in the form of LNG from other parts of the world.As forb pipeline gas, one of the Reuters sources said that PetroChina has asked for cuts in daily volumes. As for LNG, according to one source, the state company had asked for a deferral of several cargoes to the third quarter.The move comes after another state energy company, CNOOC, suspended its contracts with at least three LNG suppliers, Reuters recalls. CNOOC is China's largest importer of liquefied gas.The news suggests that natural gas storage space in China is full while demand remains subdued and likely to stay that way for an as of yet undetermined period of time. Reports about the economic activity in the world's largest manufacturing and exporting nation have been bleak, with expectations now about not just a slowdown in growth but an actual GDP contraction for the first quarter.\"PetroChina has done its best over the past month mitigating the virus impact and tried not to issue such a notice, including diverting cargoes to India and Singapore,\" one of the Reuters sources said. \"But unlike CNOOC (which sent the notice earlier) which may see demand slowing recovering, PetroChina is grappling with a sharp seasonal demand fall from mid-March (for piped gas) when the heating season ends.\"By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "title": "Chinese Teapots' Oil Imports Tumble To 6-Month Low In February",
        "content": "Crude oil imports by China's independent refineries, or teapots, fell to the lowest in six months, at 2.76 million bpd last month, down by almost a fifth from the record-high January import rates, an S&P Global Platts survey showed.While imports normally decline in February, the size of the monthly drop was the result of the coronavirus outbreak, which has driven oil demand in China into the ground--and when it will begin recovering remains unclear.The situation of Chinese refiners is quite unenviable right now. A fuel glut caused by excessive refining capacity last year pushed their profits down by as much as 42 percent as total refining capacity in the country reached 17.2 million bpd at the end of 2019.Now, amid the outbreak and the consequent slump in demand for refinery products, China's teapots are also facing financial problems as banks start refusing to extend their credit lines for fear they might not be able to cover their obligations if the effects of the outbreak-cased crisis turn out to be too severe for some refiners to survive.Meanwhile, the teapots are also cutting their run rates and closing whole refineries. According to the S&P Global Platts survey, as many as 15 independent refineries in the teapot province of Shandong were shut, while those that kept operating cut their run rates considerably, to an average of just 36 percent.One of the new refiners that came on stream last year, adding to the overcapacity, the 400,000-bpd facility of Hengli Petroleum in Dalian, cut run rates from 108 percent to 90 percent last month.There is some good news, however, according to unnamed sources who spoke to S&P Global Platts. These source said they expected demand to rebound this month and imports to pick up. If this happens, it would be a much needed positive signal for oil prices.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Venezuela has moved to seize assets of six shipping companies claiming they have unpaid debt to state oil company PDVSA, Reuters reported, quoting a document it had seen and two unnamed sources.According to the document, originating with Venezuela's maritime authority INEA, a court had decreed that the six shipping companies had misappropriated funds at the expense of PDVSA without mentioning the exact size of the misappropriation.Reuters notes that private shipping companies operating in Venezuela on behalf of its clients pay the Venezuelan state company fees for using the oil ports, which PDVSA owns, as well as fees for services such as anchorage and tugboats.PDVSA is the focus of a recently announced energy emergency that President Nicolas Maduro blamed on U.S. sanctions.\"The sanctions, the blockade - I will not accept any more excuses. I am signing a decree to declare an energy emergency in the hydrocarbons industry in order to adapt necessary and urgent measures to guarantee national energy security and protect the industry from imperialist aggression,\" the Venezuelan president said at the end of February.Then, earlier this week, PDVSA said the president had appointed four new vice presidents at Venezuela's state oil firm and a new president of the unit managing the company's relations with private foreign firms.Pressured by the sanctions as well as by years of underinvestment and mismanagement, PDVSA has passed a lot of day-to-day field operations into the hands of its foreign partners. The U.S., however, is not done with it.\"The President has made a decision to push harder on the Venezuelan oil sector and we're going to do it.

        "content": "The European Commission proposed on Wednesday enshrining the European Green Deal's commitment for carbon neutrality by 2050 into legislation, as part of the European Union's heightened focus on climate action and policy.Under a European Climate Law, the 2050 carbon neutrality target would become legally binding, and all EU institutions and member states will be collectively bound to take the necessary measures at EU and national level to meet that target.   The Climate Law would enshrine into law the EU's political pledge to become climate neutral by 2050, the Commission said, noting that the proposed law is a crucial part of the European Green Deal, which the EU's executive arm proposed at the end of last year.  \"We are acting today to make the EU the world's first climate neutral continent by 2050,\" the European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement on Wednesday.  \"The Climate Law is the legal translation of our political commitment, and sets us irreversibly on the path to a more sustainable future. It is the heart of the European Green Deal. It offers predictability and transparency for European industry and investors. And it gives direction to our green growth strategy and guarantees that the transition will be gradual and fair,\" von der Leyen noted.Under the Green Deal, the EU will support investments in sustainable businesses, technologies, and solutions and in greener energy and electricity generation. The Deal also includes a so-called Just Transition Fund to support with money packages regions and/or countries heavily reliant on coal. The deal is a \"watershed moment for the energy sector,\" Wood Mackenzie said after the 2050 carbon neutrality goal was first announced in December.\"Pressure on European fossil fuel producers to commit to net-zero carbon, including Scope 3 emissions, will continue to ramp up,\" said Valentina Kretzschmar, Wood Mackenzie Director - Corporate Research.

Analysts have surmised that the markets were already pricing in additional cuts by OPEC+, and any failure to fulfill market expectations could have a profound negative effect on oil prices.OPEC has routinely pulled out a win in the eleventh hour, so all hope is not lost, and the bump in the road that is Russia may serve to successfully manage expectations in a market that was primed for a cut between 600,000 bpd and 1 million bpd.Last week, rumors surfaced that Saudi Arabia and two other OPEC members would be willing to go it alone should Russia fail to jump on board with additional cuts.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

According to the spokesman, the remote vessel was \"trying to explode\" the oil tanker.The spokesman stopped short of naming the attackers or their country of origin or the name of the oil tanker that was targeted.Yemen continues to be a rocked by fighting between the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels and Saudi Arabia. On February 21, Houthi rebels launched a missile attack on Saudi Arabia, but the Saudis were able to intercept the missiles, according to Saudi Arabia. The Houthis claimed the attack, but offered a different version of events, claiming that it struck their objectives--which were \"sensitive targets\"--with \"high precision\".Tuesday's events are just the latest development in a string of hostilities between the two opposing groups, with no end in sight.The Houthi rebels took responsibility for the September 14 attacks on Saudi Aramco's oil infrastructure that cost some 5.7 million bpd in lost oil production capacity last year. Both Riyadh and Washington blamed the attacks on Iran, which continues to deny any involvement. UN investigators last month determined that the Houthis did not, in fact, carry out the Saudi attack.  The Yemeni war, which began in 2015, has led to the worst humanitarian crisis in the world at the moment, and there is no end in sight, with the fight between the Houthis and the Saudi-led coalition recently intensifying around the key port city of Hodeida.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Morgan Stanley updated its oil demand forecast for this year, saying it expected it to be close to zero in China after the devastating coronavirus epidemic.\"We now expect China's oil demand growth in 2020 to be close to zero, from already low pre-Covid-19 growth expectations of 350 kb/d,\" the investment bank said in a note, as quoted by Reuters. \"As Covid-19 has been spreading globally, demand outside China is likely to slow further.\"So, that's a drop in demand growth of at least 350,000 bpd, which is generally in tune with the oil demand growth forecasts of the EIA, the IEA, and OPEC. All three last month revised their oil demand growth forecasts down, with the IEA being the most pessimistic, expecting a dip in oil demand in the first quarter, at 435,000 bpd, which would be the first demand contraction in a decade.The EIA was also pessimistic, revising its outlook for oil demand by 378,000 bpd, noting that in China, oil demand growth could fall by 190,000 bpd because of the outbreak.OPEC was most optimistic, expecting oil demand growth to be 230,000 bpd lower than its earlier forecast for 2020.Morgan Stanley said it expected global oil demand this year to grow by a modest 500,000 bpd, which is a revision from 800,000 bpd. On the positive side, the bank also said it expected OPEC to announce additional cuts of 1 million bpd at this week's meeting in Vienna, which would raise the total to 2.7 million bpd, and extend the cuts to the end of the year.Unfortunately, even OPEC's additional cuts won't do much for prices, according to Morgan Stanley's analysts, who said they expected Brent to stay range-bound within the $50s throughout the year.The news that OPEC was considering 1 million bpd in additional production cuts gave oil prices some relief but forecasts such as the one Morgan Stanley just released won't help as they all seem to agree that the market will remain oversupplied, discouraging a real price rally.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "As top officials from OPEC countries start to arrive in Vienna for this week's OPEC+ meeting, OPEC's top producer Saudi Arabia is pushing for a huge cut of more than 1 million bpd, while restive cartel producer Libya, which has lost 1 million bpd due to the port blockade, thinks that there's no need for additional cuts on top of that outage. Saudi Arabia wants the OPEC+ coalition to agree to a collective cut of more than 1 million bpd, delegates told Bloomberg on Wednesday.On Tuesday, the Joint Technical Committee of the OPEC+ group, meeting before the regular OPEC meeting, considered bigger oil production cuts--between 600,000 bpd and 1 million bpd, and ended up recommending additional cuts of at least 600,000 bpd.  But the head of Libya's National Oil Corporation (NOC), Mustafa Sanalla, told S&P Global Platts on Wednesday that additional deeper cuts were \"not logical\" and that the 1 million bpd outage in Libya was \"enough\".  \"I think there is no need to reduce because they've already now lost 1 million b/d,\" Sanalla said, as carried by Platts.Some analysts have warned in the past weeks that the OPEC+ decision is being complicated not only by the uncertainty regarding the recovery of Chinese and global oil demand, but also by the Libyan outage with uncertain timelines as to when the country could return 1 million bpd to the market.Meanwhile, Iran's Oil Minister Bijan Zangeneh told reporters in Vienna that there is an oversupply on the market and \"it's necessary that OPEC and non-OPEC do something for the balance in the market,\" Iran's oil ministry's news service Shana reported.The partners need to cut at least 500,000 bpd of their production, Zangeneh said, noting that in his opinion, \"the Russians would resist until the last moment not to lower their output.\"This weekend Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested that Moscow would continue to play ball and cooperate with OPEC, although it sees current oil prices as \"acceptable.\" By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

The price of a Brent barrel was also trading up on Tuesday, by $0.11 (+0.21%), at $52.01--down by roughly $2.40 week on week.The API this week also reported a draw of 3.9 million barrels of gasoline for week ending February 28, after last week's 74,000-barrel build.

        "content": "As the coronavirus spreads fast outside China, dampening consumer and business sentiment, analysts continue cutting their forecasts of oil demand growth this year.In one of the latest downward revisions, Rystad Energy slashed on Thursday its global oil demand growth projection to just 500,000 bpd for this year, down from an initial pre-outbreak estimate of 1.1 million bpd, which was cut by 25 percent in February.\"Our data now point to a much more pessimistic outcome, with growth likely to fall to merely 500,000 bpd, and this is assuming that the Covid-19 epidemic will largely be contained by the end of June, which in turn implies a further downside risk,\" Rystad Energy said on Thursday.Rystad's revised oil demand growth forecast comes after IHS Markit warned that oil demand in Q1 would likely register the largest decline on record, larger even than the slump that accompanied the 2008 financial crisis.Even if the OPEC+ coalition agrees on Friday to deepen the current cuts by 1.5 million bpd in Q2, this will not be enough to rebalance the market and prop up prices, according to Bjornar Tonhaugen, Rystad Energy's Senior Vice President, Head of Oil Markets.The OPEC+ group is meeting on Friday in Vienna, where OPEC will be trying to persuade Russia to sign up to a massive 1.5 million bpd cut in Q2. If Russia agrees to this proposal, Brent Crude prices could stay above $50 a barrel, as long as Libya's 1 million bpd production remains shut in, Rystad says.All three scenarios Rystad has modeled include the assumption that Libya's production will return to normal in April.If OPEC and its Russia-led non-OPEC partners reach a kind of a 'low-level compromise'--agreeing to deepen the cuts by 600,000 bpd in Q2 and extending the current agreement-- Brent Crude prices could fall to the low $40s in the second quarter.In the least likely, as per Rystad, 'no deal' scenario, the lack of agreement tomorrow would result in a huge oversupply on the market and Brent could drop to $40.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

The purpose could be to make Russia and other producers feel the pain that Saudi Arabia is feeling in the price department and convince them to agree to cuts, according to Blas and DiPaola.However, if this is indeed the Kingdom's purpose, it may be miscalculated as Russia is less reliant on oil revenues and it also has no ambitious multi-billion-dollar investment programs. And, according to analysts, it wants to hurt U.S. shale.\"Russia has been dropping hints that the real target is the US shale oil producers, because it is fed up with cutting output and just leaving them with space,\" analysts from energy consultancy FGE said in a note cited by CNN. \"Such an attack may be doomed to failure unless prices remain low for a long time.\"Now that Saudi Arabia has decided to do a U-turn, its impact on shale producers would be pretty quick to manifest: a lot of the industry is already feeling pain from lower prices before the crash, coupled with a growing unease among banks to lend to shale drillers who have billions in pending debt repayments.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

Now, on top of the glut, the LNG industry in Canada has been fighting an uphill battle with environmentalist opponents to every new energy project.Last month, environmentalists staged a series of railway blockades in an attempt to stop the construction of the Coastal GasLink pipeline that should deliver natural gas to the only LNG project that has started construction: the LNG Canada facility in British Columbia.Related: Oil Prices Collapse 8% As Novak Tells OPEC+ To Pump At WillIn the second week of February alone, Canadian National Railways had to cancel 400 trains as environmentalists and rights activists blockaded rail lines and ports, as well as road intersections and government offices as a demonstration of solidarity with members of a First Nation, the Wet'suwet'en, who oppose the Coastal Gaslink pipeline.The railway operator then started shutting off its operations in eastern Canada and its chief executive warned that it would have to lay off up to 6,000 people if the blockades continue, although the layoffs will be temporary.The blockades only began to be taken down this week, after Wet'suwet'en chiefs reached an agreement with representatives of the federal and British Columbian governments to resolve some of the problems around the Coastal GasLink project. The opponents, however, stand ready to resume the protests if they feel the need to do it, which has substantially heightened the uncertainty around Canada's LNG plans.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Everywhere you look, it seems like things have taken a turn for the worst. The coronavirus crisis has wreaked havoc across markets. The U.S. political system is in a frenzy. OPEC is crumbling. Geopolitical tensions are reaching a boiling point. Vacations are stuck in limbo. And our favorite technology is being used against us. But at least you'll be able to hop in the car and drive as far away from all of those problems as you want. Gas is cheap. Cheaper than it's been in quite some time, in fact.  The national average for a gallon of gasoline is sitting at a comfy $2.40. That's a whole $1.70 cheaper than the record highs set back in 2008, and a $0.20 cheaper than GasBuddy's yearly projections. And in the deep south, gas prices are even cheaper. In Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas, some gas stations are posting prices as low as $2.01. GasBuddy's senior petroleum analyst Patrick DeHaan said the spreading respiratory illness triggered a drop in global demand that could benefit domestic motorists for weeks to come.\"Tens of thousands of flights have been canceled, people have been told to stay from school and work, and now that's spreading,\" DeHaan said. \"What you're seeing is a reduction in oil demand globally that has pushed the price of oil down.\"Related: OPEC To Russia: It's OverSo What's Behind The Cheap Fuel?The first and most obvious factor is the price of crude oil has plummeted since the beginning of the year. Brent prices have fallen from a high of $70.25 in early January to $46.12 today. And some say that the downward spiral isn't finished just yet. With OPEC failing to come to an agreement over further cuts, and the cartel looking exceedingly likely to end its short-lived relationship with Russia, things are likely to get worse for oil before they get better. On top of the OPEC drama unfolding, the coronavirus crisis has sent panic through traders across the globe. Hedge funds, investors and traders are piling back into safe haven assets. That being said, if you're looking at the glass half full, your commute just got a lot cheaper, and as driving season inches closer, it might be time to ditch the cruise you had planned, and start looking for an escape across America's beautiful highways.

        "content": "OPEC+ oil producers overcomplied with their collective production cut deal in January, thanks to overcompliance from OPEC members, Russia's TASS news agency reported on Friday, quoting two sources in OPEC+ delegations.According to those sources, OPEC and its non-OPEC partners led by Russia saw their combined compliance rate at 112 percent in January, compared to 145 percent in December. The means that the OPEC+ group reduced their collective oil production by a combined 1.9 million barrels per day (bpd), compared to an agreed cut of 1.7 million bpd as per the deal forged in December 2019.While OPEC producers overcomplied with a compliance rate of 136 percent in January, the non-OPEC producers which include Russia had their compliance at 55 percent in the first month this year.Compliance rates in both the OPEC and non-OPEC camp fell from December, but the agreed cuts in January were larger than those in December.Russia's production of crude oil and condensate in January, for example, inched up to 11.28 million bpd, up from 11.26 million bpd in December for the highest production level since August last year. Russia's production data include condensate which Moscow managed to have removed from its quota as of January.The compliance rate in January highlights that fact that the OPEC producers were and still are much more motivated to overcomply with the production cut deal than the Russia-led non-OPEC group.Despite the collective overcompliance, the coronavirus outbreak caught OPEC and its allies off guard and they passively watched oil prices slide as more evidence of demand destruction piled up.  OPEC and its non-OPEC partners are meeting in Vienna on Friday to discuss a deeper collective cut of 1.5 million bpd until the end of 2020 in response to the loss in demand. At the time of this writing just after 1. p.m. Vienna time, Russia continued to be the holdout to a deal, still refusing to join deeper cuts.

        "content": "A private Mexican firm has received several million barrels of crude from Venezuela's PDVSA in exchange for corn and water, Reuters reports, citing documents from the company, named Libre Abordo.So far, Libre Abordo has received 6.2 million barrels of Venezuelan crude, to resell on international markets and has another two cargoes of crude oil and fuel, to be loaded this month, according to PDVSA documents Reuters has seen.The contract between the Mexican firm and Caracas was signed last year, Libre Abordo told Reuters, and was still in effect. Since there were no cash payments involved in the relationship, there was no danger of violating U.S. sanctions against Venezuela.Venezuela has been grappling with hyperinflation and shortages of basic products as a result of the U.S. sanctions levied on the Maduro government, which Washington has declared illegitimate. Oil is the country's biggest export commodity and U.S. sanctions have crippled this revenue stream, forcing the government to seek other ways to bring in food and, apparently, water.Yet Venezuela's oil industry is far from dead. PDVSA operates oil fields via joint ventures with foreign companies, including Rosneft, several Chinese companies, and U.S. Chevron, and it has now left most of the day-to-day operations under the control of the foreign partners.The company even plans to restart two heavy oil upgraders later this year as it seeks to reverse a severe decline in oil production, despite the latest sanction blow, against the Swiss-based trading arm of Rosneft, which has been marketing Venezuelan crude. Following the announcement of the new sanctions, Venezuela's oil exports actually rose, by 9 percent, as buyers rushed to stock up before the May deadline Washington had set for a wind-down of these purchases.A barter deal in these circumstances seems like one of the very few way for Venezuela to find a market for its oil while receiving some much needed commodities.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "title": "Saudi Aramco Waits For OPEC+ Decision To Price Its April Oil",
        "content": "Saudi Arabia's oil giant Aramco usually tells customers on the 5th of each month how much they will pay for Saudi crude oil for the following month. But this month the 5th is not just any ordinary date--apart from the coronavirus outbreak, Saudi Aramco should take into account the OPEC+ decision about deeper cuts in Q2--and this decision will come on the 6th.So Aramco, which in ten years has never missed publishing its official selling prices (OSPs) for the following month on the 5th of each month, has postponed the pricing announcement from Thursday to Saturday, sources familiar with the plans told Bloomberg on Thursday. In pricing its oil, Saudi Arabia takes into account the availability of its oil and the overall demand on the markets in various regions--and the availability metric is unquantifiable as of Thursday.  OPEC proposed on Thursday that the OPEC+ coalition, which includes the non-OPEC partners led by Russia, deepen the production cuts by 1.5 million bpd in Q2. Such a deal hinges on Russia's approval, and Russia--as usual--is not giving away anything ahead of the very day of the full meeting of the OPEC and non-OPEC producers, which is set for Friday.Saudi Aramco, the state-owned firm of OPEC's largest producer, is thus waiting for the official decision for cuts (or no cuts) in order to set its official selling prices for April.  Last month, Saudi Arabia reacted to the depressed demand in Asia due to the coronavirus by slashing its official selling prices (OSPs) to the region for March.According to a Reuters poll of six refiners, Aramco is expected to further slash its OSP for its flagship Arab Light grade bound for Asia for April by US$2.04 a barrel on average, which would be the deepest cut in Saudi pricing in more than eight years--since early 2012, as per Refinitiv Eikon data.A second consecutive cut in prices for Asia suggests that demand has slumped in the key oil growth market due to the coronavirus outbreak.Last week, Saudi Arabia was said to be cutting its crude exports to China by at least 500,000 bpd in March because of a slump in refinery demand amid the outbreak.

        "content": "An energy consultant who had worked for Shell for decades has started talks with Venezuela's state oil firm PDVSA to help it reduce gas flaring at oil sites, but the U.S. sanctions on the Latin American country could derail such projects.Ex-Shell executive Mounir Bouaziz has worked on projects for reducing gas flaring at Shell's operations in Iraq, and now, as an independent energy consultant, he looks to replicate in Venezuela some of the success in cutting gas flaring in Iraq, Bouaziz told Reuters in an interview published on Thursday.PDVSA alone cannot spare any money to invest in gas processing plants or other infrastructure that would reduce gas flaring at Venezuela's oil fields, where natural gas is also pumped as associated gas but can't be used because of lack of either infrastructure or equipment.So Bouaziz is looking to attract private investment to repair outdated or broken equipment at Venezuela's facilities. Talks with PDVSA on projects for reducing gas flaring are at early stages, he told Reuters, and he also admitted that the U.S. sanctions could prove a hurdle in talks with potential investors and/or import of equipment into Venezuela.Over the past decade, the volume of Venezuela's gas flaring--a source of greenhouse gas emissions--has risen while its crude oil production has slumped by more than 50 percent, according to estimates from Reuters and consultancy Gas Energy Latin America.If Venezuela were processing and selling the associated gas from oil production at market prices, it could get as much as US$1.5 billion in revenues a year, Antero Alvarado, Venezuela director at Gas Energy, told Reuters.The U.S. government, however, is stepping up pressure on Venezuela's energy industry and it slapped sanctions on a Geneva-based trading unit of Rosneft, saying that the company Rosneft Trading has been helping Nicolas Maduro's regime to evade sanctions and to continue selling oil to keep the regime alive.Now the U.S. Administration is looking to further increase the pressure on Venezuela's oil industry and exports, and even Chevron's waiver to operate in Venezuela might not be renewed next month.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

The departure of the two veteran executives, who quit with a dozen other Glencore employees, is not expected to impact the oil trading business of the Switzerland-based commodity giant in Russia, according to a source at a Russian oil firm who spoke to Reuters.The Russian oil company typically communicates and works with Glencore's desk in London, which manages all the business with the oil trading firm, the source told Reuters.

        "content": "After oil prices collapsed in the worst drop in nearly three decades--courtesy of the renewed Saudi-Russia rivalry on the oil market - Russia's Finance Ministry said on Monday that Moscow had enough resources to cover budget shortfalls amid oil prices at $25-30 a barrel for six to ten years.  The price of the Russian export grade Urals dropped to below $42.40 a barrel on Monday as oil prices tumbled by 30 percent after Saudi Arabia launched an all-out price war with Russia following the collapse of the OPEC+ group with the 'no deal' outcome of talks on Friday.  The $42.40 Urals price is the price at which Russia's budget is balanced, the Russian Finance Ministry said on Monday, noting that the country's sovereign wealth fund, the National Wealth Fund (NWF), had as of March 1 liquid assets worth US$150.1 billion, or 9.2 percent of Russia's gross domestic product (GDP).  Those assets are enough to compensate for lower oil revenues due to the drop in oil prices, the finance ministry said. Even if oil prices were to stay at $25-30 for a long period of time, the NWF has enough liquidity to maintain the macroeconomic and financial stability of Russia's economy, the finance ministry says.  The liquidity at NWF is enough to compensate for oil prices at $25-30 for six to ten years, it added.It was the OPEC+ deal that has brought significant economic benefits to Russia, which saw its NWF double its financial reserves to US$124 billion in 2019, Kirill Dmitriev, chief executive at the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), said in January this year.Some analysts argue that the oil price war will end up hurting Russia's economy much more than Vladimir Putin would like it to. Others, such as Chris Weafer, founding partner at Macro-Advisory consultancy in Moscow, say that Russia has what it takes to win the oil price war with the Saudis.\"Moscow is unlikely to blink first, certainly not for another three to six months,\" Weafer said, as quoted by AFP's Anna Smolchenko.

        "title": "Gas Could Be In Even Bigger Trouble Than Oil",
        "content": "Excess production, depressed demand, and weak prices: this sums up the natural gas market right now even better than it sums up the oil market. Unfortunately, with the China coronavirus outbreak on track to become global, things for gas may well get worse before they get better. And while oil is suffering, at least it's got a cartel to attempt to balance things out. Gas doesn't, putting it at an even greater disadvantage.  The global oversupply of natural gas is nothing new. A combination of new LNG and pipeline capacity and milder winters in some parts of the world combined to tip the market into oversupply that persists to date. However, demand has been worsening thanks to the outbreak that some are already calling a pandemic in the making. As a result, gas prices in Europe, Asia and the United States are falling.In Europe, the benchmark has lost 27 percent since the start of the year after losing close to 50 percent last year. In the United States, Henry Hub futures prices are currently below $2 per million British thermal units until July, when the futures price tops $2 per mmBtu. According to Richard Soultanian, president of energy consultancy NUS Consulting Group, prices in the U.S. could weaken further, to $1.50-$1.60 for near-month contracts, before they begin improving later in the year.What could possibly help gas prices? Europe is full of gas to the gills. So is Asia. The Energy Information Administration has forecast that U.S. gas inventories will hit a record later this year, at 1.935 trillion cu ft, which would be 12 percent above the five-year average. Production shows no signs of slowing mostly because a lot of the gas produced in the United States is associated gas from oil wells in the shale patch. There seems to be no way up for prices, and this means more pain for some gas producers, especially pure-play upstream companies in the U.S.A recent report from energy data provider Enverus \"Rockies and Bakken in Focus\" says that many producers active in the two shale areas have production prices considerably higher than benchmark prices, some higher than $3 per mmBtu. This smacks of bankruptcy unless things change quickly, after last year gas prices several times slipped into negative territory--the Waha hub benchmark once dipped to a negative $4.63 per mmBtu because of the lack of transportation and storage capacity.Related: Saudi Arabia To Flood Oil Markets With An Extra 2.6 Million BpdThe transportation problem remains although relief is coming in the form of the Permian Highway gas pipeline Kinder Morgan got cleared to build earlier this month. The pipeline will carry 2 billion cu ft of gas daily to the Houston area. Yet it won't change demand and domestic demand for gas in the United States is saturated. As one analyst put it to Bloomberg the world needs more gas-fired power generation capacity for gas prices to recover.\"Prices globally are converging and until there is a boatload of new generation built domestically and abroad, there is just simply not much room in the market,\" Campbell Faulkner, OTC Global Holdings chief data analyst said earlier this month.Yet demand could pick up sooner, at least in some parts of the world and notably the U.S., according to NUS Consulting Group's Soultanian. He expects increased electricity consumption during the summer season will provide some relief for U.S. gas prices as will gas exports to Mexico. The country is one of the biggest buyers of U.S. gas. With its demand growing as its population grows, Mexico will remain an essential outlet for surplus U.S. gas for lack of enough domestic production.U.S. LNG exports are also set for a rise this year, according to the EIA, although the authority did note that \"U.S. LNG-export capacity will continue to serve growing global LNG demand, particularly in emerging Asian markets as long as U.S. natural gas prices remain competitive.\"Competitiveness is the name of the game in LNG as all major producing countries feel the pain from the coronavirus epidemic. Those who do a lot of energy trade with China, NUS Consulting Group's Soultanian says, will feel deeper pain than those less dependent on Chinese exports.According to the EIA, U.S. LNG will remain competitive until about 2030. However, buyers from Europe are already turning cargoes away and this suggests a different reality at the moment. U.S. LNG producers are planning to bring more liquefaction capacity online this year. Cargo cancellations can't be good for these plans. However, bleak as the gas landscape is right now, there is hope and this hope comes from oil prices.Related: Trump Prepares Aid Package To Relieve U.S. Oil Producers\"Covid-19 is causing oil prices to rapidly decline,\" Soultanian told Oilprice, \"which most likely will result in lower 2020 US crude oil production that initially forecast - thereby curtailing some of the production of associated natural gas.\"NUS Consulting Group sees the gas market rebalancing around the middle of 2021 because of the impact of the coronavirus epidemic on global supply and demand patterns. Without it, the market could have rebalanced by the end of this year or the beginning of 2021 at the latest. This means smaller U.S. producers vulnerable to price swings will have to endure one or two more quarters of pain.Large players, especially state-supported ones like Qatari and Russian companies, but also the supermajors, will probably come out of this new gas crisis largely unscathed, but we might see bankruptcies in the U.S. shale patch unless a really hot summer doesn't spur a major improvement in gas demand for power generation.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "title": "Oil Price War Could Wreak Havoc On Eurasian Economies",
        "content": "A feud between Saudi Arabia and Russia that sent oil prices plunging on March 9 has rewritten economic forecasts across Eurasia.Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Russia - the former Soviet Union's largest oil producers - are preparing for budget shortfalls, pressure on their currencies and possibly recession. Adding to uncertainty is the panic over the quickening spread of the novel coronavirus causing COVID-19, which has cut consumer demand around the world.Only last year Azerbaijan increased pensions and other social services to ease the pain of inflation and address rising discontent. At the time, President Ilham Aliyev said the spending would be covered by reforms to the tax system. Some of those funds would come from higher customs revenues, consumer spending (via a value-added tax), and an expected uptick in tourist arrivals. Yet these returns are now expected to fall because of COVID-19, said Gubad Ibadoglu, a senior analyst at the Economic Research Center in Baku and an assistant professor of economics at Rutgers University.According to IMF data, Azerbaijan needs an oil price of around $53 per barrel to balance its budget. Benchmark Brent crude was trading around $36 on March 9, a market holiday in much of the former Soviet Union.Because the government fears unrest, \"it is impossible to cut social payments, which are almost 65 percent of the state budget,\" Ibadoglu said in an interview. \"The only way [to save] is to cut the investment budget and the defense budget. It's not easy to cut the defense budget [...] and the investment budget was already smaller [in 2020] than last year.\"After the last oil crash, in 2014, Azerbaijan devalued the manat twice. This time Ibadoglu expects Baku to manage a softer slide by spending hard currency reserves but foresees a run on banks when they open March 10 after a holiday weekend. \"Nobody trusts the banking sector after the two devaluations,\" he said. He also calculates that the Central Bank only has reserves to manage the manat for a few months.Related: Can Saudi Arabia Survive The Oil Price War It Started?In Kazakhstan, where the budget is based on an oil price around $57.80, President Jomart Kassym-Tokayev on March 9 promised to fulfill all government social obligations, but said Nur-Sultan would be forced to cut somewhere.The oil price crash couldn't come at a worse time. In recent days, citing force majeure due to the coronavirus, China has signaled it may slow purchases of gas from Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan.Turkmenistan is China's largest gas supplier and China buys almost 80 percent of Turkmen gas.Many in the region will be glad to hear sthat at least Russia is better equipped to manage the crash this time than in 2014, though any recession would likely hurt migrant laborers.Combined, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan supply Russia with 4-5 million temporary workers; Armenia adds hundreds of thousands more. These workers' wages contribute the equivalent of over 30 percent of GDP in both Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, making them two of the most remittance-dependent countries in the world. After the 2014 crash, remittances to Central Asia fell over 50 percent, sowing pain in places like Naryn and Badakhshan. The transfers had largely recovered in recent years.Today Moscow is much better prepared than it was six years ago, when the oil collapse combined with Western sanctions over Russia's military adventures in Ukraine gutted the ruble, sending the currency to record lows. Since then Moscow has adopted a fiscal rule, basing its budget on an oil price of $42.60 per barrel; earnings above that amount are stashed in a sovereign wealth fund. When oil falls below that point, reports The Bell, the funds are spent to shore up budget deficits. (The Finance Ministry says that the amount currently in the fund, which is over 10.1 trillion rubles, will be enough to last Russia 6-10 years with oil prices at $25-30.)This has somewhat decoupled the ruble from the oil price, though the ruble fell about 9 percent on forex markets March 9. The ruble's fall will push down other currencies in the region.For consumers, some of this pain may be mitigated by lower energy prices. For oil producers that price their exports in dollars, weaker currencies will make domestic spending cheaper. But any consolation will be ephemeral: Weaker currencies should stoke inflation.Ibadoglu said Baku did not learn from previous devaluations, that it has done too little to wean itself off oil revenues. Today looks a lot like the day before the last crisis, he said: \"The budget depends almost the same on the oil price and on oil revenues.\"By Eurasianet.orgMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Most shale oil wells drilled in the United States are unprofitable at current oil prices, Rystad Energy has warned. The Norwegian consultancy said, as quoted by Bloomberg, that drilling new wells would be loss-making for more than 100 companies.Just five shale drillers--Exxon, Chevron, Occidental, and Crownquest--can drill new wells at a profit at $31 per barrel of West Texas Intermediate.The problem is the nature of shale oil wells: while quick to start production and expand it, they are also quick to run out of oil, so drillers need to keep drilling new ones to maintain production, which is what U.S. shale patch players have been doing for years. However, this has affected investor returns, Bloomberg notes, and now it is affecting spending plans.\"Companies should not be burning capital to be keeping the production base at an unsustainable level,\" Tom Loughrey from shale oil data company Friezo Loughrey Oil Well Partners LLC told Bloomberg. \"This is swing production -- and that means you're going to have to swing down.\"The situation is more positive for drilled but uncompleted wells, according to Rystad. The consultancy said yesterday that as much as 80 percent of DUCs in the U.S. shale patch have a breakeven price of less than $25 per barrel of WTI. Yet this is dangerously close to current prices.If nobody blinks in this supply war, prices may have to go this low in order to properly reduce production and get supply-demand back in balance,\" Rystad's head of shale research, Artem Abramov, said in the news release.\"This could turn out to be one of the greatest shocks ever faced by the oil industry, as coronavirus containment measures will add to the headache of producers fighting for market share.

The UK bank cut its forecast for Brent crude to $43 a barrel from $59, and for West Texas Intermediate to $40 from $54 previously, Reuters reported.\"Oil markets face a moment of truth as disagreement between key OPEC+ members means unhinged supplies will likely overwhelm near-term market balances amid large-scale demand destruction due to virus containment measures,\" the bank said in a note.Last week, Morgan Stanley also cut its outlook for Brent crude but not as much as Barclays because Saudi Arabia had not yet announced its price cuts and production growth plans. Morgan Stanley said it expected Brent crude to average $55 a barrel in the second quarter, down from $57.50 earlier, and WTI to trade at around $50 a barrel, down from $52.50.Standard Chartered also cut its forecast on Brent and WTI this week. The UK bank now expects Brent crude to average $35 a barrel this year, down from $64 a barrel earlier. WTI is seen at $32 a barrel, down from $59 a barrel earlier.These revisions will no doubt be followed by more as analysts rush to update their expectations in light of the latest developments in OPEC+, which amount to nothing less than an all-out price war.With oil demand already severely hurt by the coronavirus outbreak that started in China but has now spread across the globe and the mild winter in the northern hemisphere that pressured demand for heating fuel, a price war could be the last straw for oil. Unless, as one strategist from JP Morgan told MarketWatch, the coronavirus returns for an encore performance in China.This is one of the hypothetical events John Normand, head of cross-asset fundamental strategy at JP Morgan, said could complicate the situation. The other hypothetical event is a large-scale lockdown in the United States. The third one, an oil price war, is no longer hypothetical.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Washington has plans to issue warnings to oil shippers, insurers, and port authorities that storing Iranian crude oil will bring the wrath of US sanctions, a US State Department official said on Monday, according to Reuters.The US will target those who store Iranian oil or oil products in violation of current sanctions, \"no matter where they are\" David Peyman, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Counter Threat Finance and Sanctions, said in a statement.The US is also looking to ship captains to obtain and submit to US authorities photo evidence of anyone engaged in the practice of ship-to-ship transfers of Iranian oil,The United States is still working to get Iran's oil exports to zero, but China, for one, continues to import the sanctioned oil.The warning from the United States are likely not empty threats. Last year, Chinese shipper COSCO had several units sanctioned after transporting Iranian crude in violation of the sanctions, resulting in a significant increase in shipping costs for the crude trade.And just two weeks ago, five US citizens were charged with violating Iranian sanctions by buying Iranian oil and selling it on to China. The accused, if convicted, face up to 25-year prison sentences and fines of up to $1.25 million each.The increased campaign on Iranian sanctions highlight the United States' dedication to bring about change after the US pulled out of the nuclear deal. While exports haven't fallen to zero, exports from Iran have fallen sharply, even after Iran's efforts to circumvent US sanctions by conducting ship to ship transfers and turning off transponders to avoid detection.Iran has admitted that the US sanctions have stymied its oil industry, but vowed to continue to resist the effects of the sanctions by increasing subversive activities in the way it ships its crude oil.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "The oil markets have been anticipating a big impact on oil demand from the coronavirus outbreak. That's why we have seen a 30 percent drop in the price of crude oil since the beginning of January.But we now have some indication of just how much oil demand has been impacted: It's the largest quarterly demand drop we have ever seen.Those are the findings from the latest assessment by the IHS Markit Crude Oil Market Service.IHS Markit projects that Q1 2020 world oil demand will decline by 3.8 million barrels per day (BPD) from a year earlier. This represents a downward revision of 4.5 million BPD from estimates prior to the outbreak. Previously, the largest quarterly decline was during the financial crisis of 2009, when Q1 oil demand fell 3.6 million BPD year-over-year.Jim Burkhard, vice president and head of oil markets at IHS Markit, noted \"This is a sudden, instant demand shock--and the scale of the decline is unprecedented.\"Related: The 3 Hottest Inverse Energy ETFsThe IHS Markit assessment also made the following observations:- Most of the demand decline is in China, but demand elsewhere, including Europe, Japan, South Korea, the Middle East, and North America, has been revised down.- COVID-19 cases outside of China continue to accelerate, which means that the negative demand impact will continue into the second quarter.- Demand for all refined products is negatively impacted, but especially for gasoline in China because of the steep decline in road travel as a result of government restrictions and for jet fuel due to flight cancellations within China and the long-haul routes to and from Asia. In China, commercial passenger trips by road, rail, air, and water were down 80 percent in February compared with a year ago.- OPEC production is at a 17-year low and could drop even further as oil buyers cut purchases in March and April. But the decline in output is still less than the decline in demand, which means oil inventories are likely to experience a large increase, particularly in China and the Middle East, unless OPEC at its ministerial meeting later this week cuts production in a major way.- It now appears likely that oil demand will be less than in 2019, even if there is a recovery in the second half of 2020.Related: Has U.S. Electricity Lost Its Spark?I often write about fundamental disconnects in the oil markets. That can occur when oil prices are declining, but the underlying fundamentals are strong. This situation is very different. This price decline is entirely warranted by such a steep decline in oil demand. Further, there's not a good indication of where the bottom may be.Since OPEC failed to get an agreement with Russia for additional production cuts, it's not out of the question that oil prices could drop back into the $20s as the coronavirus outbreak continues to spread.By Robert Rapier for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

These, the daily notes, are in critical short supply after the outbreak. The fabric is the filter layer in the middle of the masks and the respirators. Its fibers carry polarized charges that create a weak electric field, which attracts and absorbs dust, bacteria, and pollen.As of today, the coronavirus that first made an appearance in Wuhan, China, had infected more than 110,000 people, with 3,830 of the cases ending with fatalities and 62,280 people making a recovery. There are still more than 43,900 active Covid-19 cases globally, according to Wordometer, of which 37,990 mild and 5,977 critical.Meanwhile, the virus that ravaged the country, threw the world into panic, and pushed oil prices lower, seems to be abating. China official figures suggest a significant slowdown in the diagnosis of new cases, with only 99 new cases announced on Saturday, down from 2,000 a few weeks ago. The winning formula: wide-scale quarantines and severe travel restrictions.This is what Italy is doing, now, too. The country, which is suffering the worst outbreak in Europe, has quarantined as many as 16 million people in cities across northern Italy in a bid to contain the disease.The transport sector is already one of the hardest hit by the outbreak and, as a consequence, so was fuel demand in many parts of the world. However, in a surprising turn of events, Chinese customs data revealed that China's oil imports during January and February increased on the year, by 5.2 percent despite the outbreak, which by February had started affecting refinery run rates with some facilities closing down completely.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "title": "Overexposure To Oil Is Hurting Big Banks",
        "content": "With energy junk bonds crashing...... amid a (long-overdue) investor revulsion to the highly levered energy sector, much of which is funded in the high yield market, as crashing oil prices bring front and center a doomsday scenario of mass defaults as shale companies are unable to meet their debt and interest payment obligations, investor focus is shifting up the funding chain, and after assessing which shale names are likely to be hit the hardest, with many filing for bankruptcy if oil remains at or below $30, the next question is which banks have the most exposure to the energy loans funding these same E&P companies.Conveniently, in a note this morning looking at the impact of plunging interest rates on bank profitability, Morgan Stanley also lays out the US banks that have the highest exposure to energy in their Q4 loan books.So without further ado, here are the US banks that stand to suffer the most if a wave of defaults his the shale patch:Morgan Stanley was diplomatic enough to frame these banks only in the context of their loan exposure, suggesting (strongly) they would have to significantly boost their loan loss reserves, adversely impacting the bottom line:Crude Oil collapsed 25% to ~$30 per barrel from Friday's close post Friday's OPEC+ meeting which ended without the anticipated production cut. This puts oil prices at much closer if not below breakeven for many US shale producers. Regions Financial, for example, underwrites to a stressed barrel of oil of $39.20. We assume that under the new accounting rule for CECL that banks will need to boost reserves for their oil and gas exposures during 1Q20 and 2Q20. We assume that the banks will increase their loan loss reserves against their energy portfolios to the levels reached in 1Q16 when oil prices were running at about $30. This lowers EPS in 1Q and 2Q 20, shown in Exhibit 19.Related: The Great Saudi Shale SwindleAssuming the shale situation is salvageable, Morgan Stanley then lays out the large and mid-cap banks that have the most loan exposure and will likely have to boost their reserves to the levels seen during the Q1 2016 energy crisis:We pulled energy exposures for the Large Cap and Midcap banks to assess how much the lower oil prices could drive up provisions. We are using each bank's most recent energy loan disclosure listed below. We assume that the banks today are holding a 1% reserve ratio against these exposures. We then looked at how much loan loss reserves banks held against energy loans in 1Q16,a time when oil prices were around $30 per barrel. We assume that the banks will need to increase their loan loss reserves against energy loans back to those 1Q16 levels in 1Q and 2Q this year,assuming oil holds at ~$30. This increase in loan loss reserves is a bit quicker than prior cycles, but since we are operating under the new Current Expected Credit Loss accounting model (CECL), banks will need to reflect life time losses for their oil exposures at an oil price today that is roughly half of what it was on December 31,2019 when it ended the year at ~$66For the largest banks this means billions in incremental energy reserves, subtracting directly from the bottom line.What other linkages are there from the US energy sector to the rest of the economy? In a word, countless. That said, one attempt to quantify the potential spillover from Nordea's Martin Enlund suggests that the biggest risk is to already stagnant US CapEx (in addition to coming shortages and virus quarantines).Related: Why Russia Is Rooting For Bernie SandersA key leading indicator to observe if a manufacturing collapse is materializing, is the weekly oil rig count where a plunge would telegraph much more economic pain:And while lower prices were good news for the US economy - as they would boost real incomes thanks to lower gasoline prices - the emergence of the US as an oil producing powerhouse change the dynamics, and as the 2015/2016 manufacturing recession showed, plunging oil prices have a far more pronounced negative impact on US capex, coupled with fiscal austerity in oil exporters.Finally, and as discussed earlier, sharply lower oil prices pose an imminent risk to the critical US credit market, which in recent years became the primary pillar propping up stocks (by funding trillions in buybacks). As Nordea's Martin Enlund notes, \"if \"unforeseen losses\" show up in the high yield sector (very energy-heavy), it might damage the credit cycle... and if the credit cycle cracks, forget about buybacks, M&A, and SPX's current valuation.\"By Zerohedge.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

OPEC's top producer and de facto leader, Saudi Arabia, has signaled it would not attend the panel meeting, regardless of its format, one of the sources told Reuters.Earlier today, reports suggested that the meeting would go ahead, but in a teleconference format because of the coronavirus outbreak which is spreading in Europe, Bloomberg quoted Kazakhstan's Energy Minister Nurlan Nogaev as saying on Thursday.Russia's energy ministry believes that under the circumstances a teleconference is the most adequate format for holding the meeting, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Thursday, but didn't confirm the date of March 18, saying that \"we need to ascertain if we have received an official invitation.\"Related: Uber's Green Competitor Is Riding A $30 Trillion Mega-TrendOn Wednesday, Novak said that Russia would send representatives to the meeting of the OPEC+ panel, reiterating Moscow's readiness to continue cooperation with OPEC in some form after the collapse of the OPEC+ production cut deal and oil prices. Novak's comments came a day after he said that \"the doors aren't closed\" to future cooperation between Russia and OPEC, despite the breakup of the OPEC+ production cut agreement.OPEC+ has meetings scheduled for May or June to assess the situation on the market, the Russian minister said, but his Saudi counterpart seemed to dismiss Russia's comments that cooperation should continue.   \"I fail to see the wisdom for holding meetings in May-June that would only demonstrate our failure in attending to what we should have done in a crisis like this and taking the necessary measures,\" Saudi Arabia's Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman told Reuters on Tuesday.

        "content": "Oil industry representatives have pitched for discussion to the U.S. Administration the idea that Washington buy cheap crude oil to replenish the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which would also remove millions of barrels of oil from the heavily oversupplied market and may help U.S. producers that could turn out to be the first victim of the Saudi-Russian oil price war.Oil industry lobbyists have told the Trump Administration that it might be a good idea to buy the dip with oil prices in the $30s this week compared to $50 last week, in order to fill the SPR, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday, quoting three people with knowledge of the matter. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve, set up in the 1970s when the Arab oil embargo created a fuel crisis in the United States, held a total of 635 million barrels of crude oil as of March 6, 2020, including 250.3 million barrels of sweet crude and 384.7 million barrels of sour crude oil.  The SPR has been typically used in times of emergencies with Administrations releasing crude oil from it to relieve price spikes in events such as hurricanes or wars. Now the idea goes the other way round -- buy the dip to fill the SPR and remove some tens of millions of barrels of oil from the market, to ease the glut which is set to become even greater in the coming months as Saudi Arabia and Russia are each determined to see who will blink first in this oil price war.The SPR has authorized storage capacity of 713.5 million barrels, so it still has the capacity to hold another 78 million barrels before it is full.On Tuesday, the Department of Energy said that it was suspending an upcoming sale from the SPR.  Related: China's Refiners Love The Saudi-Russia Oil Price War\"The sale was designed to raise revenue for SPR facility maintenance and upgrades. Given current oil markets, this is not the optimal time for the sale. The Department continually monitors and evaluates global oil markets and will provide updated information as market conditions change,\" DOE Spokeswoman Jess Szymanski said.Apart from a possible buying for the SPR, the Trump Administration is considering other relief measures for U.S. oil producers, including tax relief.According to Bloomberg, the Administration is also weighing the idea to cut royalty rates for oil and gas production on federal land, but this idea will likely meet opposition not only from Democrats but also from some Republicans who have said that federal royalty rates are too low.

        "content": "China's independent refiners, which buy a fifth of total Chinese crude oil imports, are increasing their run rates and buying ultra-cheap crude, taking advantage of the Saudi-Russia price war, Reuters reported on Wednesday, quoting executives and traders.Economic activity in China begins to slowly recover and lockdowns in some areas are being eased as the number of China's new daily cases of coronavirus infections has been declining over the past two weeks.At one point in February, Chinese oil refiners had cut their daily run rates to around 10 million bpd--the lowest level since 2014, due to the depressed fuel demand amid strict travel restrictions. Now the easing of the quarantine zones and the recovery of more industrial activities are creating some demand for fuel, while the oil price crash with cheap crude is further helping refining margins.  While the biggest state-held Chinese refiners continue to be cautious about crude purchases and to keep run rates lower than usual, especially because of depressed jet fuel demand, the independent refiners - commonly known as teapots - are not only raising their refinery run rates from the very low levels seen in February. They are also on the market for ordering crude cargoes for arrival for May and June at much lower prices, and they have the former OPEC+ group allies Saudi Arabia and Russia to thank for the cheapest crude in years.The spot premium for May loadings of Russia's ESPO crude, one of the Chinese teapots' favorite grades, plunged this week to its lowest level since Russia started exporting this type of crude in 2010, according to Reuters estimates.After the collapse of the OPEC+ agreement last week, Saudi Arabia slashed its official selling prices to all regions and is getting ready to flood the market with an extra 2.6 million bpd next month. Russia has the ability to boost its oil production by 200,000 bpd to 300,000 bpd in the short term, with a potential for up to a total increase of 500,000 bpd, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Tuesday.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Even before the collapse of the OPEC+ talks last Friday, Saudi Arabia's finance ministry had asked government agencies to propose a 20-30 percent cut in their budgets due to the oil price slide, Reuters reported on Wednesday, citing four sources with knowledge of the plans.  Before the OPEC+ meeting last week, the Saudis were already planning government spending cuts, including via delays in projects and contract awards, as the coronavirus outbreak is dampening the oil demand outlook and weighing on oil prices and on Saudi oil revenues. The Kingdom was also expecting tough negotiations with its now former ally Russia about deepening the OPEC+ production cuts, Reuters' sources said.  Now the oil price crash after the OPEC+ break-up and the all-out oil price war between friends-turned-foes Saudi Arabia and Russia makes Saudi budget spending cuts even more urgent, considering the fact that the Kingdom needs oil prices at above $80 a barrel in order to balance its budget and that it has been running widening budget deficits since the previous oil price crash of 2014.According to Capital Economics analysts, quoted by Reuters, at the current oil prices, Brent Crude at $36 a barrel, Saudi Arabia's budget deficit will jump to 15 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) this year, compared to deficit of 4.7 percent of GDP in 2019.The Saudi sovereign wealth fund could help cover the shortfall as oil revenues slump with the price crash and glut on the market, but investments of hundreds of billions of U.S. dollars in mega projects and in the Vision 2030 plan to diversify away from oil could be delayed.The oil price war will hurt the fiscal revenues of the oil producers in the Persian Gulf, including the Saudis, OPEC's top producer and the world's top oil exporter, credit rating agency Fitch said earlier this week, and warned that that a new wave of sovereign rating downgrades could be in the works if the oil slump continues.

In total, the two projects are expected to generate up to 1.4 terawatt hours of power, about 5 percent of Azerbaijan's current energy needs.Longer term, the plans are even more ambitious: for renewables to meet 30 percent of the country's needs by 2030. With help from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Azerbaijan is developing \"renewable energy auctions\" to support private investment in further renewable energy projects.Azerbaijan currently has about 6,650 megawatts of generating capacity, and about 92 percent of the country's energy in 2019 was produced by burning natural gas.But the country's potential for renewable energy dwarfs that, Zaur Mammadov, a senior Ministry of Energy official, told an Istanbul renewable energy conference organized by the U.S. think tank Atlantic Council in February. That includes 23,000 megawatts of solar energy, 3,000 megawatts of wind, 3,000 megawatts of biomass burning, and 700 megawatts of geothermal energy.Related: Big Oil Prepares To Suffer In 2020The optimistic estimates for Azerbaijan's wind and solar potential are backed up by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) in a November report. \"Despite current reliance on oil and gas, the country has excellent wind and solar resources, along with significant prospects for biomass, geothermal and hydropower development,\" the report said.Reducing gas consumption Boosting Azerbaijan's renewable energy sector will help the country meet its commitments to reduce greenhouse gases under the 2016 Paris Agreement on climate change, which Baku has both signed and ratified.But don't assume that the push for renewables is motivated by an environmentalist impulse.In recent years, as its domestic energy consumption has increased, Azerbaijan has struggled to meet its obligations on a variety of contracts to export gas westward. To meet those shortfalls, it has had to import natural gas from Russia. Renewables offer a way to keep that from happening again.The two new wind and solar plants will free up for export about 300 million cubic meters per year of gas that Azerbaijan had been burning for domestic power use, Mammadov said.\"The Azeri authorities are concerned about climate change, and their development of renewables will help reduce CO2 emissions, but their prime incentive for developing wind and solar power is to ensure they can provide energy at home whilst maintaining gas export levels,\" John Roberts, a regional energy analyst, told Eurasianet.Related: U.S. Shale Collapse Will Lead To Higher Oil Prices\"There are routine shortages for domestic gas, and because this gas is subsidized - and the Azerbaijani authorities are worried about the social and political consequences if they reduce subsidies too fast - this means they either have to import gas or to find ways of substituting gas consumption at home with renewables,\" Roberts added.Azerbaijan is not alone in this strategy; Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan also are seeking to boost renewable energy to increase natural gas exports.Georgia, meanwhile, is seeking to boost renewable energy to reduce its dependence on the gas it buys from Azerbaijan (and Russia). George Chikovani, the CEO of the Georgian Energy Development Fund, said Georgia plans to have 1,200 megawatts of wind energy capacity and up to 6,000 megawatts of solar capacity by 2030. The country's first solar plant, with a capacity of 25 megawatts, is expected to begin operations later this year.Strange bedfellowsAzerbaijan's renewable push has an unlikely supporter in the UK.Global Warming Policy Foundation (GWPF) is a body set up by prominent climate change denier and former UK chancellor Lord Nigel Lawson. It challenges the mainstream view that climate change is manmade and opposes government policies to mitigate it. One of its longtime board members, Baroness Emma Nicholson, is the UK's trade envoy to Azerbaijan, where the energy giant BP is the country's largest foreign investor and largest producer of natural gas.But in a February 20 interview with the Azerbaijani news agency Report.az, the baroness expressed London's willingness to \"help maximize Azerbaijan's solar, wind and hydro generation,\" celebrating the opportunity for \"both of our nations to take the necessary measures to address climate change.\"By Eurasianet.orgMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "When we think about the fight against climate change, we typically think about electric vehicles, reducing emissions from coal, putting pressure on Big Oil to go green, or the tech giants leading the renewable revolution. What we don't often acknowledge, however, is the smaller industries also doing their part. Take, Mackie's, for example. It's a beloved ice cream producer in the United Kingdom, and it's on a fast track towards being completely carbon-free.Scotland's Mackie's just announced that it began the installation of its $5 million new refrigeration system that will keep its ice cream frozen using HCFC gases with power efficient units run on natural refrigerant gas ammonia, or in layman's terms, a completely sustainable form of biomass energy. The finance director of the company, Gerry Stephens, explained, \"Our ultimate aim is to one day go completely off-grid and use 100% renewable energy. This is an important step towards realising these green ambitions,\" adding \"we hope that our new system will set a precedent and make the energy-intensive food and drink sector more sustainable.\"This new addition to Mackie's new refrigeration system, the company also produces 10 million liters of ice cream per year using more than 70 percent renewable energy.Scotland: A Leader In RenewablesWhile Mackie's is doing its part to reduce its carbon footprint, it's home, Scotland has become a shining example of renewable standards.Related: Junk Status? Oil Nations Face Serious Credit DowngradesThe Scottish government plans to generate 100 percent of its electricity through the use of renewables in 2020. And in 2019 alone, its renewable capacity accounted for as much as 25 percent of all of the United Kingdom's renewable generation.Scotland's resource base for renewable generation is astounding by any standards. While sunshine may not be abundant, it has plenty of wind, waves and tides to make up for it. And the Scottish people are all for the shift towards renewables, as well.

        "content": "Mexico is ready to act as mediator between Saudi Arabia and Russia who turned from partners to opponents on Friday when Russia quit the OPEC+ production cuts. In response, Saudi Arabia announced it was cutting the prices of its oil and planning a production boost.\"We along with some other countries are looking to be a type of third party to build bridges,\" Mexico's Finance Minister Arturo Herrera told media, as quoted by Reuters.Mexico has previous experience with OPEC-related mediation, Reuters recalls. Back in 1998, it brokered talks between Saudi Arabia and Venezuela who were at odds about production at the time and they struck an agreement that led to higher prices.Whether it would be successful now remains an open question. Russia said it was going to stop complying with OPEC+ production quotas from next month on Friday. Saudi Arabia responded with an announcement it would cut its official selling prices for oil by between $6 and $8 a barrel, also from April. It went on to say it would increase oil production by close to 3 million barrels daily next month.The Kingdom, which is currently producing less than 10 million bpd of crude, said it would raise its output to 12.3 million bpd in April. In evidence that the move is aimed to cause the greatest pain, the figure is 300,000 bpd above Saudi Arabia's current production capacity, which means it would be using oil from storage to flood the market.Related: Big Oil Prepares To Suffer In 2020Oil tanked on the news but since Monday has been regaining ground on positive news such as plans for economic stimulus in the United States and elsewhere in response to the coronavirus epidemic, and reports of the outbreak slowing down in China, its country of origin.However, the chances of prices rising anywhere near to where Gulf producers and Saudi Arabia need them to be without curbing production are zero. This means that short of an actual war, the Kingdom has no other choice but to pursue the path it took this weekend and stifle competition with excessive--and cheap--output.In this situation, and amid still depressed oil demand, it is questionable whether any mediation would be successful.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

The energy ministry has called the meeting days after Russia refused to play ball in OPEC's umpteenth proposal for production cuts.OPEC's leader and top producer Saudi Arabia and Russia on Friday put an abrupt end to their three-year-long oil bromance trying to support oil prices and erasing the glut on the market. Russia's Energy Minister Alexander Novak told OPEC+ countries that they were free to pump oil at will after April 1, after OPEC and Russia failed to agree on deeper cuts in response to the depressed oil demand due to the coronavirus outbreak.Saudi Arabia responded with an attempt to grab market share from Russia with a significant cut in its official selling prices (OSPs) to all regions and with signals that it plans to boost production as of April 1, sending oil prices into a tailspin on Monday.Russia issued a statement yesterday, saying that it had enough resources to cover budget shortfalls amid oil prices at $25-30 a barrel for six to ten years. The Russian oil industry holds a quality resource base and enough financial margins to continue to be competitive at any price and to keep its market share, Novak said at a government meeting on Monday.The largest Russian oil company, Rosneft, which has long criticized the OPEC+ agreement, slammed the deal after the OPEC+ coalition broke up.The OPEC+ agreement was meaningless from Russia's point of view, Rosneft's spokesman Mikhail Leontyev told Russian outlet RBC on Sunday.\"By ceding ground on our markets, we take cheaper Arab and Russian oil off the market only to clear the field for more expensive U.S. shale production and to help its production efficiency,\" Leontyev said.

        "title": "Tesla Plans To Ditch Cobalt In New Batteries",
        "content": "Reuters recently reported on Tesla's announcement that it is in advanced talks to use batteries from China's Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Ltd (CATL) that contain no cobalt specifically for use in cars made at Tesla's Shanghai plant.The statement went on to say as a result of using CATL's lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) batteries, Tesla would be able to substantially lower the cost of those cars using the alternative battery technology, as cobalt is the most expensive component in traditional nickel-cobalt-aluminum (NCA) and nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) batteries.The statement, however, did not say what the impact of the alternative batteries would be on range.Along with lack of charging infrastructure range is another most widely reported issue buyers worry about with EV's. CATL's Li-Fe-P technology is proven and in relatively widespread use, an expert on the industry told MetalMiner in a recent confidential briefing. The battery design is mainly used in larger applications like buses, particularly in China. CATL was an early proponent of this technology at a time when the Chinese state-provided grants to enable this chemistry to be commercially developed, but it is a chemistry rarely used in EV's were the greater power density of NCM and NCA batteries continue to dominate despite the higher cost.Tesla's motivation can probably be traced back to promises made by Elon Musk to lower the cost of standard models, as cheaper CATL batteries are said to reduce the cost by double-digit margins. Potentially significant considering one source reported the cost of replacing Tesla 3 battery modules could be $7,000 and Investopedia advised that Tesla's flagship car, the Model S, could have battery costs of approximately 42% of the model sales price.As our contact observed, Musk is long on statements -- his vow to reduce sticker prices should be seen in that context.Related: Why Fracking Will Never Be Banned In The U.S.There is a practical reality that in the longer-term, performance will sell cars and the Li-ion battery costs of all hues are lowering all the time. It will still be a few years before electric vehicles (EVs) are being knocked out at the same cost as conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles.In the meantime, there will only be a sub-set of Tesla's client base that is willing to compromise an already limited range for price, so most models will continue to use cobalt-containing battery chemistries.Particularly with what appears to be a very competitive Ford rival coming out this year in the all-electric Mustang EV that looks like it could give the Model 3 a run for its money, competition for a sector Tesla has dominated is heating up.As for the cobalt price, Tesla's announcement may shake some investors, but the market is already in surplus. With Glencore's Mutanda mine on care and maintenance for at least two years, there is something in excess of 20,000 tons of cobalt, our contacts tell us, ready to come back onstream should EV take-up really accelerate faster than anticipated and cause demand-driven price rises.By Stuart Burns via AG Metal MinerMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Even though OPEC is now flooding the market with cheap oil, Unipec - the trading unit of Asia's largest refiner, Chinese Sinopec - is attempting to defer or cancel the loading of at least four supertankers from the Middle East in April, due to higher freight rates and expected reduction in processing rates, sources familiar with Unipec's plans told Bloomberg on Friday.Middle Eastern producers sell their oil traditionally via long-term contracts with buyers, and in this case, Unipec is looking to get out of buying some crude cargoes loading in April compared to the full volumes it was allocated by producers, Bloomberg's sources say.Unipec will be looking to cut at least four supertanker cargoes, each capable of transporting 2 million barrels of oil, to as many as eight cargoes on supertankers, according to Bloomberg. One reason is the higher freight rates, the other reason is that Sinopec plans reduced refinery run rates across its refineries in May because of the still depressed Chinese fuel demand, Bloomberg's source said.While the biggest state-held Chinese refiners continue to be cautious about crude purchases and to keep run rates lower than usual, especially because of depressed jet fuel demand, the independent refiners are not only raising their refinery run rates from the very low levels seen in February--those smaller refiners, commonly known as teapots, are also in the market for ordering crude cargoes for May and June arrival at much lower prices, and they have the friends-turned-foes Saudi Arabia and Russia to thank for the cheapest crude in years.After the collapse of the OPEC+ agreement last week, Saudi Arabia slashed its official selling prices to all regions and is getting ready to flood the market with an extra 2.6 million bpd next month. Russia can boost its oil production by 200,000 bpd to 300,000 bpd in the short term, with a potential for up to a total increase of 500,000 bpd, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said on Tuesday.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

WTI was trading at $31.78 a barrel at the time of writing with no prospects to go much higher any time soon.This is particularly bad news for producers who have not hedged their future production at higher prices, according to analysts, and these will soon sink into the red. In this situation, their only chance for short-term survival seems to be oilfield service providers once again cutting their prices as they did during the 2014-2016 price crisis.Reuters quoted Parsley Energy's chief executive David Del-Osso as saying the company had sent a letter to oilfield service companies asking them \"to reconsider your pricing\" and offer Parsley price cuts of at least 25 percent.Parsley Energy and Marathon Oil were among the first to announce cuts in their spending plans. Parsley said it will idle three of its 15 active rigs while Marathon said it would cut its spending by 30 percent from last year.More companies are likely to follow suit with such announcements: this time, unlike in 2014, the oil price crash was fast and brutal, and, more importantly, largely unexpected as most expected OPEC+ to agree deeper production cuts, as they had on three previous occasions.Oilfield service providers were forced to cut their prices during the last crisis to keep afloat. As a result, they suffered more than exploration and production companies and took longer to recover from the fallout of lower oil prices.

He added that he had raised the topic with federal finance minister Bill Morneau but that it was too early to share any details.Western Canadian Select was trading at just $16.10 a barrel today, at the time of writing, sinking from close to $40 a barrel last month before the coronavirus began spreading globally for real.Alberta's oil industry has already been battered by a pipeline shortage that has pressured the price of the commodity produced in the province, by higher transport costs associated with oil trains that companies have been forced to use to move their oil, and by the unfavourable investment climate that recently made Teck Resources cancel its $20-billion Frontier oil sands project that would have added more than 250,000 bpd to Alberta's oil production.Related: Oil Price Crash Continues Despite $1.5 Trillion Fed InterventionInterestingly enough, the Albertan government was quite optimistic about the energy sector when it released its budget plan for 2020-2023 last month. In the document, the government said it expected more oil pipelines to come online in the province during this year and next, and oil sands production to increase, while the gap between West Texas Intermediate and Canadian crude narrows. The government of Canada's oil heartland expects the average for WTI during fiscal 2020-21 to be $58 a barrel, rising to $63 in fiscal 2021-22.Now that this is unlikely to happen, plans may have to be revised. Kenney said the government had already set aside $100 million in loans for orphan well reclamation that would create jobs and that the provincial government would push for a pause in new federal regulations that would have a bearing on the energy industry.\"Layering on additional regulatory costs, which could impose billions of dollars of cost on the Canadian energy sector right now, would be like going to the Ontario auto sector in 2008 and saying, 'oh, by the way, we're going to force you to pay billions more in federal regulations,'\" the Alberta Premier said.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

TTI took over the handling of Venezuela's oil trade after the US sanctioned another Rosneft subsidiary, Rosneft Trading SA (RTSA) for brokering the sanctioned country's crude. According to the US Department of Treasury TTI purchased 14 million barrels of crude from PdVSA.The sanctions block all property and interests in property of TTI that are in the US or in the possession or control of US persons, as well as any entities that are owned, directly or indirectly, 50 percent or more by the designated individuals and entity.The sanctions will include a wind-down period until May 20, for both RTSA and TTI. The US reiterated its intention of lifting the sanctions \"for those who take concrete, meaningful, and verifiable actions to support democratic order in Venezuela.\"The Trump administration has in the past referred to Rosneft Trading as the \"gravest violator\" of the imposed limits on Maduro as much of the Western world wants him ousted.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

Alaskan officials admit that the oil price collapse will impact state revenues and constrain spending options, but they see the oil market rout as a short-lived bump in the road. Analysts, however, are not so optimistic and warn that the fallout could be worse than just a blip.In December 2019, Alaska expected Unrestricted General Fund (UGF) revenue to total $2.1 billion in FY 2020 and $2.0 billion in FY 2021. The revenue forecast was based on an annual average Alaska North Slope (ANS) oil price of $63.54 per barrel for FY 2020 and $59.00 per barrel for FY 2021.On Thursday, the price of ANS was in the $30s.\"If low oil prices persist, it is likely to have a negative effect,\" Timothy Little, director of U.S. public finance at S&P Global Ratings, told Bloomberg.If oil prices stay at current levels for longer, they could cost Alaska's economy some $300 million in revenue, according to Alaska Public Media.Commenting on the oil price crash, Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy told a news conference on Monday:\"I would say this is definitely a momentary bump in the road for Alaska. Our oil patch is in it for the long haul.\"Oil and gas revenues account for around 90 percent of Alaska's state revenues, while the crash in stock markets in recent days is also depreciating the value of the Alaska Permanent Fund.Even before the Saudi-Russia oil price war, the fund had lost $2.8 billion of its value as of the beginning of March, due to declining oil prices and markets because of the coronavirus outbreak, Anchorage Daily News reported.Texas, Oklahoma, and North Dakota also rely on the oil and gas industry for state income, but their share of oil income for the state budget is lower than in Alaska.

It will likely have to enforce strict austerity measures after its fellow OPEC member and the cartel's de facto leader, Saudi Arabia, launched an all-out oil price war with Russia, after the former allies abruptly ended the OPEC+ production cut deal last Friday.   \"The oil price collapse ... means the deficit will be doubled and the only choice left for Iraq is to resort to international creditors,\" Mudhhir Salih, an economic advisor in the office of Iraq's prime minister, told Reuters.According to an analysis of Iraq Oil Report of official Iraqi export data, should Brent Crude prices stay at around US$30 a barrel, Iraq's revenues would be less than US$3 billion a month, which is US$2 billion short of the sum Iraq needs just to pay its current expenses.The oil price war will hurt the fiscal revenues of the oil producers in the Persian Gulf, including the Saudis, credit rating agency Fitch said earlier this week and warned that a new wave of sovereign rating downgrades could be in the works if the oil slump continues.

        "content": "Surging shale production and growing global demand for light low-sulfur oil helped U.S. crude exports to soar by 45 percent year on year in 2019, reaching an average of 2.98 million barrels per day (bpd), the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Thursday.  The United States exported crude oil to 44 different destinations last year, compared to 41 export destinations in 2018. Canada was the biggest buyer of American crude with a 15 percent share, closely followed by South Korea with 14 percent of all U.S. crude exports.  Due to the U.S.-China trade war, American exports of crude oil to China slipped by 100,000 bpd on average in 2019 from 2018 and averaged just 133,000 bpd last year. This sent China down the list of the biggest buyers of U.S. crude--from third in 2018 to seventh in 2019, as per EIA estimates. America's crude oil exports to China dropped in 2019, but exports of crude to other destinations jumped, most notably to South Korea, the Netherlands, and India, the EIA said.   The top ten buyers of U.S. crude oil in 2019 were Canada, South Korea, the Netherlands, India, the United Kingdom, Taiwan, China, Italy, Thailand, and Singapore.Related: Will Trump Bail U.S. Shale Out?Growing U.S. crude oil production and exports have resulted in America selling oil to more destinations around the world than the number of countries from which it imports crude oil, the EIA said in October 2019. A decade ago, the United States was importing crude oil from as many as 37 foreign sources per month, and its exports were restricted almost exclusively to Canada. After the lifting of those restrictions at the end of 2015, U.S. crude oil exports have been on the rise and reaching more destinations.The United States was a net exporter of crude oil and petroleum products last month, with the four-week average net imports at a negative 907,000 bpd in the last week of February, the lowest 'imports' level in EIA data dating back to 1973.Despite the 'net petroleum exporter' status, the U.S. continues to be a net importer of crude oil--it continues to import more volumes of crude oil than it exports. In November 2019, the latest monthly data, America imported 5.8 million bpd of crude oil and exported 3.0 million bpd of crude, the EIA said last month.

        "content": "For years now, Russia has been laser-focused on insulating itself from an external economic shock.It may have just sparked one.In an unexpected move on March 6, Russia rejected a call by OPEC countries to further cut oil production in order to help prop up prices amid sagging global demand for energy due to the coronavirus.The decision broke three years of cooperation under an arrangement called OPEC+ and stunned participants at a meeting in Vienna, not to mention some of Russia's own oil executives -- one suggested the move was \"irrational\" -- and governments from the Middle East to the West.OPEC leader Saudi Arabia swiftly responded to the snub by announcing it is no longer obliged to hold back production, causing the largest single-day drop in the price of oil in nearly three decades and sending global stock markets and the ruble tumbling. Why?One potential answer: President Vladimir Putin wanted to punish the United States by putting severe pressure on the U.S. shale-oil industry, which has sold millions of barrels of oil while Russian companies kept production down under the existing OPEC+ agreement.\"The Kremlin had decided that propping up prices as the coronavirus ravaged energy demand would be a gift to the U.S. shale industry,\" Bloomberg News reported. The acerbic spokesman for Russian state oil giant Rosneft, Mikhail Leontyev, suggested that was at least one of the motives, telling the agency: \"Let's see how American shale exploration feels under these conditions.\"Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin, an old and close Putin ally, has long been said to be chafing under the existing OPEC+ production limits, and was widely seen as playing a role in the decision to reject further cuts.Some analysts played down the idea that the Kremlin was out to get U.S. shale, however, saying that Russia's coordination with OPEC+ was fragile to begin with and that Moscow and Riyadh had different views of the current volatility on the global oil market.Whatever the reasons, it's a risky move for Moscow at an uncertain time.The oil price collapse stoked by Moscow's move and concerns about the effects of the coronavirus on a slew of industrieswill hurt Russia's economy in the short-term, and there is no guarantee that it can knock out U.S. shale in the long run, analysts said.U.S. BenefitsThe United States has been a beneficiary of the high prices maintained by the OPEC+ output cuts over the past few years, overtaking Saudi Arabia and Russia -- now Number 3 -- as the world's largest oil producer.As the coronavirus ravaged the Chinese economy and hit others around the world, slashing oil demand, Saudi Arabia lobbied for OPEC+ to cut another 1.5 million barrels at the March 6 meeting in Vienna. Russia recommended maintaining the existing cuts. OPEC+ -- a 24-member group consisting of OPEC nations plus non-cartel members like Russia -- first agreed to oil production cuts in 2017.Saudi Arabia's announcement that it would hike production sent the price of U.S. crude oil tumbling by 25 percent on March 9 to a low of $30 a barrel. Prices gained back some of the losses on March 10 but were well under $40 for U.S. and the global benchmark, Brent Crude.Some U.S. shale producers have a break-even price of $50 a barrel or above, putting them in a vulnerable position, said Chris Weafer, an energy specialist and founder of Moscow-based consultancy firm Macro-Advisory.Oil producers in Saudi Arabia and Russia have lower production costs, enabling them to weather the price.\"There are three parties facing off against each other -- Russia, Saudi, and U.S. shale -- and it really is a case of who blinks first,\" Weafer told RFE/RL.Several analysts said that in the short-term, Russia is in the strongest position among those three players.\"The impact of this price crash on U.S. shale companies is going to be pretty devastating\" in the short term and could result in a U.S. production decline in 2020, said Gregory Brew, a historian at Southern Methodist University in Texas focusing on energy politics and the Middle East.Diamondback Energy, a Texas-based shale producer, announced March 9 it would immediately reduce investment following the price drop.Russian oil companies have some insulation. They are profitable at a $30 oil price, helped by a free-floating currency, and the budget is protected for years to come.Related: The Reason Why Russia Refused To Cut Oil ProductionThe Kremlin's conservative fiscal policy over the past few years boosted foreign currency reserves to about $570 billion and driven down the price of a barrel of oil necessary to balance the budget from above $100 to below $50.At the current ruble rate of nearly 75 to the dollar, the budget can balance at $40 per barrel, said Elina Ribakova, deputy chief economist at the Institute of International Finance in Washington.Saudi Arabia's budget break-even oil price is closer to $85 and its foreign currency reserves have been declining amid a massive state spending program.Risky BetRiyadh not only faces budget pressure, but potentially investor pressure to cut production to keep the market stable, Sarah Ladislaw, a senior vice president at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, said in a March 9 note.Riyadh recently sold shares in state oil company Saudi Aramco, raising $25.6 billion in the world's largest initial public offering. The shares are now below the price the investors paid for them.But the U.S. shale industry has shown resilience in the past and is likely to do so again, analysts said. Low oil prices lead to consolidation, which should make companies more competitive in the longer term, Brew said -- the opposite of what Moscow may be angling for.Saudi Arabia failed to achieve the goal of shuttering the U.S. shale industry several years ago: The producers improved their efficiency in response to price pressure, driving down their own production costs.Unlike large onshore or offshore oil fields that can take years to develop, shale fields can start producing in weeks, said Rauf Mammadov, an energy analyst at the Middle East Institute in Washington. And the biggest U.S. oil companies, which are less vulnerable than smaller outfits, are investing more into shale.\"It will not impact the shale industry in the long run,\" Mammadov told RFE/RL.Meanwhile, the impact of the oil price drop is being felt globally, including in Moscow.'Very Unexpected, Irrational'Russia's already slow-growing economy could potentially contract this year if oil prices stay low for the rest of the year, said Ribakova. She previously forecast growth of more than 2 percent in 2020.Russia is losing $100 million to $150 million a day at an oil price of $40 rather than $60, said Leonid Fedun, the billionaire vice president for strategic development at Lukoil, Russia's second-largest oil producer, which is not state-owned.Related: Saudi Arabia Strikes Back At Russia In Key Oil MarketFedun called the collapse of the Russia and OPEC+ agreement \"very unexpected, irrational.\"That's not the view at Rosneft, though. Sechin was the driver behind the Kremlin's decision not to agree to additional cuts, Weafer said.In June, Sechin accused the United States of using sanctions against energy-producing nations to make room for U.S. domestic production.The United States has angered the Kremlin by imposing sanctions on Russian Baltic Sea export gas pipeline Nord Stream 2, delaying its completion indefinitely, and by slapping penalties last month sanctioned a trading arm of Rosneft for doing business in Venezuela.In 2019, the United States supplied oil to Russia's western neighbor Ukraine for the first time -- as Kyiv seeks to reduce reliance on Moscow amid a continuing war with Russia-backed separatists in its east -- while Belarus has inquired about purchasing U.S. oil as it seeks alternatives to Russian crude.Rosneft will increase production by 300,000 barrels a day following the exit from the agreement with OPEC+, Bloomberg reported, citing unidentified company officials.Mammadov questioned the notion that Russia is targeting the U.S. shale industry.The abundance of global supply, while largely driven by the United States, is also due to greater output from Canada, Brazil, and other non-OPEC countries, some of which have high-cost production and will be impacted, he said.\"This is more the outcome of the failure of the negotiation rather than a premeditated strategy or tactic\" to crush U.S. production, Mammadov said. \"There are too many global unknowns at the moment and that is the reason why Saudi Arabia and Russia could not agree on cuts.\"If the spread of the coronavirus retreats globally, leading to a pickup in economic activity and oil demand, the tensions between Russia and Saudi Arabia will ease as the question of greater cuts subsides, Mammadov said.Another factor potentially limiting the depth of the price war is the Kremlin's determination to maintain the political influence it has achieved in the Middle East in recent years, Weafer said.That greater influence was on display in October 2017 when Saudi Arabia's King Salman traveled to Moscow, the first-ever visit by the nation's leader to Russia.\"The Kremlin will want to try to get back to the negotiating table because the political relations\" with Saudi Arabia are \"very important,\" Weafer said.By RFE/RLMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Employees at U.S. oil supermajors have lost $5 billion in savings since the end of 2018 as more than a third of these savings were in company stocks, which have been battered by oil price swings amid heightened market uncertainty.Reuters reported the figures, based on research of company disclosures, which showed the five biggest U.S. oil companies by market size--Exxon, Chevron, Conoco, EOG Resources, and Occidental Petroleum--held $44 billion in 401 (k) employee assets at end-2018, for around 66,000 employees. Of the total, 36 percent was in company stock.However, the average return on these five companies' stock over the period covered by the research, was a negative 44 percent, Reuters also reported, with the range between -22 percent and -77 percent.The portion of savings held in energy company stocks across the five biggest oil majors in the U.S. compared with just 6 percent held in company stock across all industries, Reuters noted, a much healthier portion to hold in stocks.\"A lot of people think their company's stock is safer than an index fund,\" says David Blanchett, Morningstar's head of retirement research. However, he added, \"It doesn't make any sense from a household finance perspective.\"This seems to be especially true for energy companies. These have been underperforming indices for quite a while as investors became more cautious about their bets on oil and gas after the last oil price crisis and amid growing awareness of climate change and its implications for the long-term profitability of oil and gas companies.Since the start of the year alone, Exxon's stock has fallen from over $70 to about $42 apiece. Chevron's stock has slumped from over $120 to $83 since January. ConocoPhillips has slid from over $65 to about $32. EOG Resources has lost more than half of its value, down from $84 to $39 since January. Finally, Oxy's stock has fallen from over $42 to less than $12.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Canada's Husky Energy is the latest North American oil firm to slash spending amid collapsing oil prices, saying that it is reducing its capital budget by US$648 million (C$900 million) for 2020 and cutting or shutting in production where it is cash negative.In light of the challenging market conditions--with oil prices down 30 percent from last Friday after the breakup of the OPEC+ deal and the relentless spread of the coronavirus outbreak--Husky Energy is cutting its capital spending to US$1.66 billion-US$1.8 billion (C$2.3 billion-C$2.5 billion) from previous guidance of US$2.3 billion-US$2.45 billion (C$3.2 billion-C$3.4 billion). The company also lowered its production guidance to 275,000 bpd-300,000 bpd from 295,000 bpd-310,000 bpd expected earlier.Husky Energy is also suspending investment in resource plays and conventional heavy oil projects in Western Canada and halting drilling of sustaining pads at all thermal operations.Husky Energy's budget and production reductions came after Cenovus Energy said as early as on Monday that it is slashing its 2020 capital spending by around 32 percent in order to maintain the strength of its balance sheet in the price collapse.\"Being price takers has made us uniquely vulnerable to dramatic shifts in the oil price and what we're seeing today will have immediate negative impacts on Canada's economy,\" Tim McMillan, President and CEO at the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP), said on Monday.  Drillers in Canada and the United States are turning into the first collateral victim of the Saudi-Russia oil price war as the former allies vow to turn on the taps in April and flood an already oversupplied market reeling from depressed demand amid the Covid-19 outbreak.The collapse in oil prices is forcing U.S. oil producers to slash capital spending and dividends as many of their operations are unsustainable and deep in the red at $30 a barrel WTI Crude.

        "content": "Asian refiners are increasingly looking to book smaller tankers to load oil from the Middle East as the freight costs for chartering supertankers have surged after Saudi Arabia pledged to boost oil supply to the market and is provisionally booking supertankers in addition to its own fleet.Malaysia's state oil company Petronas has provisionally booked a Suezmax, capable of carrying 800,000 to one million barrels of oil, from the Middle East to Malaysia, Bloomberg reported on Monday, citing ship brokers, traders, and fixtures.To compare, the supertankers, the so-called very large crude carriers (VLCCs), can transport up to 2 million barrels of oil.The rates for the VLCCs, however, have jumped five to ten times in one week after the Saudis snapped up supertankers to flood the world with oil next month, leaving fewer VLCCs available and resulting in a price spike for the daily charter rates.Some Indian refiners also look for smaller vessels for the relatively short trip from the Middle East to India, as ballooning supertanker rates haven't tricked down to smaller ships yet.\"The spike in rates will push people to restrict VLCC use for faraway crudes and prioritize shorter voyages in Suezmax and Aframax vessels,\" Hindustan Petroleum's chairman Mukesh Kumar Surana told Bloomberg.Aframaxes can carry between 500,000 and 800,000 barrels.Some buyers may find the surging supertanker rates too steep to book in the coming monthUnipec, the trading unit of Asia's largest refiner, Chinese Sinopec, is said to be attempting to defer or cancel the loading of at least four supertankers from the Middle East in April, due to higher freight rates and expected reduction in processing rates, sources familiar with Unipec's plans told Bloomberg on Friday.The current rush for supertankers and the subsequent price spike may not last long, especially if the provisional bookings don't materialize in actual contracts, analysts and ship brokers say.

        "title": "Azerbaijani Economy At Stake As Oil Prices Plummet",
        "content": "Demand for dollars has spiked in Azerbaijan amid fears of another currency devaluation following a plunge in oil prices.A feud between Saudi Arabia and Russia led to a sharp drop in oil prices on March 9 and they have remained low, finishing the week at under $34. Azerbaijan's economy is highly dependent on oil and gas revenues, and its current state budget is based on an oil price of $53.The government maintains a de facto peg of the currency, the manat, against the US dollar, and can prop up its budget in times of low international oil prices by devaluing the manat. It did so twice in 2015, creating substantial hardship for ordinary Azerbaijanis who held their savings in manats.With those memories in mind, many Azerbaijanis were seeking to trade their manats for more reliable dollars in anticipation of another potential devaluation. Some banks responded by limiting their sales of dollars.Natig Jafarli, an economist and the co-founder of the political party REAL, reported that on the morning of March 11 he went to four banks in Baku, none of which were selling dollars; he described the situation as \"tense.\"A list compiled by Banker.az showed that while some banks were still selling dollars others have imposed limits, started requiring the use of ID cards, or suspended sales altogether.Related: Saudi Arabia's Oil War Could Bankrupt The KingdomAmid the concern, the Azerbaijani government has given little indication of what it plans to do and has given rosy public assessments of the situation.\"We are ready for any oil price, for any challenge,\" said Elman Rustamov, the Chairman of the Central Bank of Azerbaijan, in an interview with Real TV on March 16. \"There is enough potential in the country to manage the situation without making any emotional decisions. We can manage the situation while maintaining the level of social welfare we have achieved, without creating any additional problems for the financial sector.\"Vusal Gasimli, the director of the state-run think tank Center for Economic Reforms and Communication, told the news agency APA on March 16 that the currencies of many of Azerbaijan's major trading partners have already dropped relative to the dollar, effectively boosting the manat.\"Thanks to the measures taken, the country's economy is more stable than during the global financial and economic crisis that began in 2014,\" Prime Minister Ali Asadov said following a cabinet meeting the previous week. \"I want to note that despite the negative economic trends in the world, our economy is developing, and the country's financial capabilities are expanding.\"Asadov insisted that Azerbaijan had sufficient foreign currency reserves - equivalent to more than the country's gross domestic product - and urged businesses and citizens to \"demonstrate restraint.\" But he said the government would be strengthening controls on currency transactions. \"Illegal actions and cases of abuse of the situation will be resolutely suppressed,\" he said.Related: Largest Oil Glut In History Could Force Crude Prices Even LowerAs of March 13, the State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan had sold nearly one billion dollars in the previous 12 days.Shortly after the oil price plunged, Rustamov announced that the Azerbaijani government and the Central Bank have a \"plan B\" for the state budget that was specifically developed for oil prices in the 30-35 USD per barrel price range. \"We have the potential to confront the problem properly,\" Rustamov explained. \"I call on the people to be calm.\"But the lack of details in Rustamov's announcement meant many Azerbaijanis weren't satisfied. Jafarli replied in another Facebook post: \"Dear Mr. Elman, put the 'Plan B' aside. What was the 'Plan A' - I'm curious.\"And the uncertainty revived concerns about Azerbaijan's unsteady progress toward diversifying its economy away from such a heavy dependence on oil and gas.\"Strategic roadmaps and promotional mechanisms have been prepared, several state programs have been conducted, but these have not had a serious transformation on the economy,\" Rashad Hasanov, an economist, said in an interview with Radio Azadliq.By Eurasianet.orgMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

Last month, the United States slapped sanctions on a Geneva-based trading unit of Rosneft, saying that the company Rosneft Trading has been helping Nicolas Maduro's regime to evade sanctions and to continue selling oil to keep the Venezuelan regime alive.In response to the sanctions, Rosneft said in a statement in February:\"The sanctions announced by the U.S. Treasury Department against Rosneft's subsidiary RTSA and its Chairman are illegal, unjustified, and an act of legal abuse.\"Then earlier this month, the US targeted another Rosneft subsidiary that had picked up the PdVSA oil mantle.The U.S. Treasury has given companies worldwide time until May 20 to wind down operations with Rosneft Trading, otherwise they risk secondary sanctions for continued dealing with the company sanctioned by Washington.It looks like China's Sinochem has chosen not to side with Russia in this matter, despite close China-Russia relations. Related: Big Oil Is Literally Burning Cash In The PermianAccording to one of Reuters' sources, the Chinese company is steering clear of any Rosneft or Rosneft-related trade with oil because it fears that the U.S. could widen sanctions to Rosneft companies other than Rosneft Trading.In a tender looking to buy crude oil on Monday, Sinochem explicitly said that the crude it would purchase should not come \"from or related to Rosneft Oil Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates\", a document seen by Reuters shows. Sinochem shunning Rosneft's oil comes at a time in the new oil price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia, former allies turned foes which now promise to flood the market with oil in a renewed battle for market share in every corner of the world.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

In both cases, the companies removed staff from the site.The Covid-19 outbreak has caused the sharpest oil price drop in years, with Brent crude hovering around $33 a barrel at the time of writing, and West Texas Intermediate at a little over $30 a barrel.The outlook is not particularly good, either. With travel restrictions and people self-isolating, demand for crude oil in the United States alone could fall by as much as 2.5 million bpd, with demand for car fuel alone shedding some 300,000 to 400,000 bpd through the end of the year.Shale producers, which are the most vulnerable to such oil price shocks, have started tightening their belts again. Some are idling rigs and many are cutting their spending plans in the face of lower oil prices, aggravated by the oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia, which some believe is actually an attack on U.S. shale.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

The industry suffered a substantial blow by the latest oil price crash, especially in the shale patch.According to Trump, the purchases would save \"the American taxpayer billions.\"According to Bloomberg calculations based on the Friday closing price of West Texas Intermediate, if the government buys 77 million barrels of crude, it will pay $2.4 billion for it.The Strategic Petroleum Reserve has a capacity to hold 713.5 million barrels of crude. Currently, it holds some 635 million. Three years ago, some legislators suggested it might be time to stop hoarding oil in the SPR given the fast increase in domestic oil production and falling exports. However, the dominant opinion remains that the SPR is necessary and the latest move by Washington has just revealed a secondary purpose to it: providing some relief for troubled shale producers. Whether this relief will be enough, however, remains questionable.Most shale independents budgeted average prices of WTI much higher than the current $30 a barrel. Now that the Covid-19 pandemic is battering all industries and oil demand forecasts are getting gloomier by the day, the pain is becoming sharper. Many are preparing to begin cutting their spending plans and at least one company--Parsley Energy--has asked oilfield services providers to cut their prices by at least 25 percent.Meanwhile, fund managers and investment bankers expect oil demand to suffer its greatest annual decline on record, possibly dropping by more than the 2.65 million bpd that was recorded in lost demand in 1980.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

Vitol hasn't traded Venezuelan crude oil since the beginning of last year when the U.S. tightened sanctions against Nicolas Maduro's regime and essentially banned Venezuelan crude oil exports into the United States.Since then, the U.S. Administration has further increased the pressure on Maduro and Venezuela's oil industry by sanctioning last month a Geneva-based trading unit of Rosneft, saying that the company Rosneft Trading has been helping Maduro's regime to evade sanctions and to continue selling oil to keep the regime alive. Washington sanctioned its second Rosneft subsidiary this week.Vitol is negotiating the purchase of Venezuelan oil from Mexican firmLibre Abordo, which had received the oil in a barter deal with Venezuela in exchange for aid.Vitol fully complies with any existing laws and regulations, including sanctions on Venezuela, the oil trading giant told Bloomberg, noting that \"Vitol would only consider receiving product of Venezuelan origin if it had the relevant assurances that it could do so lawfully.\"Last week, Reuters reported that privately owned Libre Abordo had received so far 6.2 million barrels of Venezuelan crude to resell on international markets and has another two cargoes of crude oil and fuel, to be loaded this month. The Mexican company received the barrels of crude from Venezuela's state oil firm PdVSA in exchange for corn and water, according to documents Reuters has seen.The contract between the Mexican firm and Caracas was signed last year, Libre Abordo told Reuters, and was still in effect. Since there were no cash payments involved in the relationship, there was no danger of violating U.S. sanctions against Venezuela.

        "content": "Jet fuel demand will be the hardest hit fuel sector as the coronavirus outbreak spreads across the world, countries impose travel restrictions, and airlines continue to cancel thousands of flights, Rystad Energy said in a new report on global demand for oil and fuels.  Jet fuel demand is set to slump by 11 percent year on year in 2020, from last year's demand of around 7.2 million bpd. Global air traffic is expected to plunge by 16 percent on the year, according to Rystad.\"US President Donald Trump yesterday announced a ban on air travel between Europe and the US, which will further impact an aviation industry that has already been suffering as the virus has spread. Many distressed airlines will now face heavy cost cuts, and many non-profitable routes are likely to be closed,\" the analysts noted.Rystad Energy now expects global oil demand to drop by 600,000 bpd this year, or by 0.6 percent, compared to 2019.\"This is a severe downgrade compared to previous estimates and takes into account the quarantine lockdown in Italy, massive cancellations of flights by airlines, the travel ban between Europe and the US that was announced yesterday, and our simulations of the virus' growth patterns this year,\" the energy research and analytics firm said.  Major organizations and international bodies have already dramatically cut expectations for this year's global oil demand as the Covid-19 outbreak results in restricted travel and slowing economic activity.OPEC, for example, now sees global oil demand rising by mere 60,000 bpd in 2020 after it has slashed its forecasts by 920,000 bpd from just a month ago.The International Energy Agency (IEA) warned this week that oil demand was set to drop this year for the first time since the financial crisis in 2009 due to the coronavirus outbreak and its impact on economies. The IEA now sees global oil demand falling by 90,000 bpd year on year in 2020. By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Despite the low oil prices that brought on by the combination of the coronavirus pandemic's migration to the United States and the oil price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia, US shale producers will together hit a new record output next month, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA).Today, the EIA predicted that OPEC's shift to maintain its market share will cause global inventories to increase further, and prices to fall further.And the US shale will do its part to contribute to a global increase.Oil production in the seven most prolific shale basins will hit a new high of 9.075 million barrels per day in April, an increase of 180,000 barrels per day. The largest increase will come from producers in the Permian basin, adding 38,000 bpd of the 180,000-bpd total increase, reaching 4.79 million bpd.  All other basins are expected to see a decrease in oil production next month.Meanwhile, gas production in those seven plays is expected to decrease, the EIA said, by 188 million cubic feet per day.Related: The Most Destructive Oil Price Crash In History?Russia and Saudi Arabia are waging an oil price war, with Saudi Arabia ramping up production to more than 12 million bpd, and has booked VLCCs to carry more oil to its customers for next month. Both Russia and Saudi Arabia have insisted that they can comfortably withstand these lower oil prices. Analysts aren't sure of those optimistic statements, nor that US shale will be able to keep its debt-laden head above water in a sub-$30 WTI environment.US shale producers are now facing a more direct coronavirus challenge as lawmakers in the States work to shutdown nonessential businesses and activities in an effort to stop the coronavirus from spreading. In Texas, home to part of the Permian basin, schools have been closed and could remain closed for the remainder of the academic year, and Dallas and San Antonio have banned large gatherings.In New Mexico, housing the other part of the Permian, Governor Grisham ordered state employees to work from home, and called on other businesses to follow this as well.Other states have closed bars, restaurants and movie theaters, and the California Bay area has ordered residents to remain at home for three weeks.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "The benchmark U.S. oil price plunged to its lowest level in 18 years early on Wednesday and Brent Crude dipped below $30 a barrel for a four-year-low, as the worsening impact of the coronavirus chaos continues to roil the markets despite massive stimulus from major central banks.At 12:08 a.m. EDT on Wednesday, WTI Crude had plunged to $23.56, down 13.79 percent on the day and the lowest level since 2003. Brent Crude was trading down 7.93 percent at $28.00, the lowest price since the beginning of 2016.  With Brent plunging to multi-year lows, the price of the OPEC basket of thirteen crudes stood at $30.36 a barrel on Tuesday, compared with $30.63 on Monday, according to OPEC Secretariat calculations.At those prices, no OPEC producer can balance their budget and have enough oil revenues to cushion the blow from the looming global recession.The last time Brent Crude was this low was in early 2016 when a glut weighed heavily on oil prices.  This time around, the glut will be much larger than the 2016 record oversupply, by two to four times, as per estimates from IHS Markit.  The largest-ever glut is coming as oil demand is slumping due to the coronavirus pandemic and former allies Saudi Arabia and Russia promising to flood the market with oil as they are in an all-out price war for market share.The Saudi Arabia-Russia feud is unfolding while the Covid-19 pandemic is wiping out millions of barrels per day of oil demand around the world as a growing number of countries are going into lockdown, closing borders, and banning flights from the most heavily impacted countries.The markets are in panic mode and no central bank stimulus has managed to turn around sentiment as investors and speculators fear that the larger the stimulus, the worse the impact on economies authorities expect.\"The demand picture continues to deteriorate as more countries implement shutdowns and put in place travel restrictions which have seen airlines cut capacity. Meanwhile, the pickup in oil supply from April following the breakdown of OPEC+ talks does mean that these weak prices are likely to linger for quite a while longer,\" ING strategists said on Wednesday.

They will only be paid for the weeks worked, Halliburton said.The move is the latest in a string of announcements from the shale industry, all focusing on spending cuts of between 25 and 50 percent as West Texas Intermediate sank below $30 a barrel earlier this week, with prospects for improvement remaining distant.At the time of writing, the U.S. oil price benchmark had fallen further, to $25.73 a barrel, with Brent crude at $29.37 a barrel. Since the start of the year, WTI has lost 50 percent of its value.\"We believe moving to this schedule will allow us to best manage costs and provide full benefits to our employees during this difficult market,\" a spokeswoman for the oilfield services major said in a statement.Related: Largest Oil Glut In History Could Force Crude Prices Even LowerHalliburton, Reuters notes, is the largest provider of hydraulic fracturing services in the U.S. shale patch. Despite its size, it is already feeling the pain from the oil price rout, with its share price tanking by 70 percent over the last four weeks to just above $6 apiece.More pain is to come: at least one U.S. shale producer, Parsley Energy, has asked oilfield service providers to cut their prices by as much as 25 percent to help E&Ps weather the new crisis.A recent calculation by Rystad Energy revealed there are just 16 exploration and production companies active in the U.S. shale patch that have new oil well costs of below $35 a barrel, among them Exxon, Chevron, EOG Resources, and Devon Energy.

Today's inventory draw was expected to be a build of 2.933-million-barrels.In the previous week, the API estimated a large crudebuild in crude oil inventories of 6.407-million barrels, while the EIA's estimates were more bearish, reporting a largerbuild of 7.7 million barrels for the week.Oil prices were trading down on Tuesday afternoon prior to the API's data release, highlighting the still difficult oil price environment stemming from the coronavirus and exacerbated by the oil price war that Russia and Saudi Arabia are waging. As crude oil is facing a difficult demand environment, Saudi Arabia, Russia, and the UAE are all planning to unleash a flood of cheap crude on the market, sparking concern.At 2:07 pm EDT on Tuesday the WTI benchmark was trading down on the day by $0.60 (-2.09%) at $28.10--down nearly $6 week on week. The price of a Brent barrel was also trading down on Tuesday, by $0.65(+2.05%), at $31.04--down by roughly $7 week on week.The API reported a large draw of 7.834 million barrels of gasoline for week ending March 13, after last week's 3.09-million-barrel draw. This week's draw compares to analyst expectations for a 3.0-million-barrel draw for the week.Distillate inventories were also down, by 3.625 millionbarrels for the week, compared to last week's 4.679-million-barrel draw, while Cushing inventories rose by 66,000 barrels.US crude oil production as estimated by the Energy Information Administration showed that production for the week ending March 06 slipped back to 13.0 million bpd.At 4:42 pm EDT, WTI was trading at $26.85 while Brent was trading at $30.29.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "A dozen U.S. Republican Senators are urging the world's top oil exporter Saudi Arabia to review plans to significantly boost oil supply to the market and lower oil prices while the world is grappling with the coronavirus pandemic.In a letter to Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, the 13 Republican Senators led by Dan Sullivan of Alaska and Kevin Cramer of North Dakota said that the extremely volatile and unsettled global oil market with plunging oil prices is \"an unwelcome development.\"\"The United States has been a strong and reliable partner to the Kingdom for decades. In light of this close strategic relationship, it was greatly concerning to see guidance from the Kingdom's energy ministry to lower crude prices and boost output capacity. This has contributed to a disruption in global oil prices on top of already hard-hit financial markets,\" said the Senators, mostly representing oil producing U.S. states such as Alaska, Texas, Oklahoma, North Dakota, and Louisiana.The Saudi-Russian oil price war in the wake of the OPEC+ deal collapse is largely viewed as a war for market share and an effort to push U.S. shale producers out of the picture as very few of them make any money at $30 oil.\"Senior Saudi government leaders have repeatedly told American officials, including us, that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a force for stability in global markets. Recent Saudi actions have called this role into question. We urge the Kingdom to assert constructive leadership in stabilizing the world economy by calming economic anxiety in the oil and gas sector at a time when countries around the world are addressing the pandemic,\" the U.S. Senators wrote in their letter to the Saudi Crown Prince.Earlier this month, U.S. shale tycoon Harold Hamm was said to be preparing to file an official complaint against Saudi Arabia with the U.S. Department of Commerce, after the Kingdom promised to unleash a flurry of crude oil into the markets, sending oil prices into a tailspin.

So the Iraqi oilfield officials were forced to halt production since they were not given the heads-up that Petronas employees would be evacuated, the officials said, adding they were working to resume the production process on Wednesday.The coronavirus outbreak is already upending the way companies -including oil companies - work, as they try to protect employees in the global pandemic. Large oil companies in the United States have asked their office employees to work from home and instituted health checks for those who cannot work from home. Exxon, BP, Kinder Morgan, and Shell were among the companies that asked their office staff to start working from home as of Monday and introduced health checks for workers at production sites.For Iraq, OPEC's second-largest producer after Saudi Arabia, the coronavirus outbreak is not only a health hazard for employees working at oilfield sites, but a serious financial trouble.Iraq, which relies on oil revenues for 95 percent of its budgetary income, is one of the least diversified economies in the Middle East.The oil price crash will likely force heavily oil-dependent Iraq to suspend new infrastructure and energy projects. The OPEC producer may also have to resort to international borrowing to make sure it can pay salaries to public servants after oil prices collapsed to half the price Baghdad had planned to budget this year, Iraqi lawmakers and officials told Reuters last week.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

The supermajor has been one of the few international oil companies that have ramped up spending levels over the past two years, aiming to grow production and shareholder value.It is also one of the many companies whose U.S. shale oil production costs are higher than the current price of West Texas Intermediate, according to calculations by Rystad Energy.Exxon has invested $6 billion on developing shale resources in the Permian, with plans to be producing 1 million bpd by 2024. Now, these plans will probably have to be changed to adjust to the new situation of prolonged demand depression and higher supply from Saudi Arabia and Russia.\"Protecting the balance sheet and dividend is the priority for this company,\" a Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. analyst said. It is unlikely, therefore, that Exxon will resort to dividend suspension or cuts although it could cut 10 to 20 percent of its spending, reducing the annual total for this year to $28-29 billion.At the time of writing, West Texas Intermediate was trading at $28.86 a barrel after the Fed on Sunday announced a second emergency rate cut, deepening recession fears that will hit the energy industry hard.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

Now, more global, higher-rated companies are in general better able to withstand a market downturn.The global spread of coronavirus will slow economic growth significantly, which will, in turn, amplify its effect on several sectors, Moody's asserts.The firm recently revised its GDP growth forecasts for the advanced G-20 economies to 1.0% in 2020, down from 1.7% in 2019, and for the emerging G-20 to 3.8% in 2020, down from 4.2% in 2019, including a substantive slowdown in China.

As a result, oil company shares also sank, triggering heavy trading, which in turn activated the Toronto Exchange's circuit breakers that switch on at a share price change of more than 7 percent, CBC New reported.Despite the ominous signs, the Albertan government appeared quite optimistic about the energy sector when it released its budget plan for 2020-2023 last month. In the document, the government said it expected more oil pipelines to come online in the province during this year and next. It also expected oil sands production to increase, while the gap between West Texas Intermediate and Canadian crude narrows. At the time, the Alberta government expected the average for WTI during fiscal 2020-21 to be $58 a barrel, rising to $63 in fiscal 2021-22.

        "title": "Commercial Nuclear Fusion Is Closer Than Ever",
        "content": "Not all the news this week is doom and gloom. First, there was the report that coronavirus is actually saving lives in China thanks to the dramatic drop in deathly pollution levels as the country's industries have been shut down. Now, a scientist out of New Jersey says he's made a breakthrough that brings us one step closer to the holy grail of clean energy. Nuclear fusion has long been touted as a silver bullet solution to climate change, with it's hugely efficient, emissions-free energy production with none of the radioactive waste that nuclear fission leaves us to contend with for hundreds of thousands of years. Unlike nuclear fission, which requires radioactive fuel sources such as enriched uranium, nuclear fusion can be carried out using only hydrogen for fuel, which is what naturally occurs on the sun 24 hours a day. This week, the story broke that a New Jersey researcher had \"a nuclear fusion breakthrough while helping his son with a science project.\"  Popular Mechanics reported that \"he realized he could explore which kinds of permanent magnets could be powerful and stable enough to be part of a fusion reactor concept called a stellarator.\" A stellarator is similar to a tokamak, the better-known donut-shared particle accelerator that is employed by several high-profile nuclear fusion experiments including France's ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor). Like a tokamak, the stellarator must be run at immensely high heats to simulate the surface of the sun in order to facilitate nuclear fusion. This makes them extremely energy-intensive, expensive, and a bit unpredictable. \"The stability of these generators is really up to chance, based on a carefully managed magnetic field.\" says Popular Mechanics, \"Extremely hot moving plasma ends up corroding the materials containing it, and these small changes can drop the temperature and throw the fusion reactor out of the power generating zone. This is where permanent magnets could change the landscape of plasma reactor design.\"Related: Saudi Arabia's Oil War Could Bankrupt The KingdomBut researcher Michael Zarnstorff of the Max Planck-Princeton Research Center for Plasma Physics says that he may have found a solution to some of these challenges through the use of permanent magnets. That breakthrough has now led to an in-depth study with three other researchers to reach a permanent magnet design detailed in a paper that the researchers published in the science journal Nature on Friday. The paper makes it clear how impactful these scientists believe their research is through its cheeky title: \"A simple fusion recipe.\" The core of that recipe is the aforementioned permanent magnet, which Popular Mechanics defines as a magnet \"whose magnetic charge comes from the chemical makeup of the material itself, like the interplay between individual electrons.\" The article continues: \"This is different from something like an electromagnet--whether that's a copper wire electromagnet or the magnetic field generated by the Earth. If behaviors or assemblies generate magnetic force, that's a temporary magnet. These magnets can't generate the required plasma flux inside a stellarator, but researchers say they can shape the course of the plasma and help to rein it in.\"This breakthrough is just the latest in a number of leaps forward for nuclear fusion technology in the past year. Last July, ITER announced that they would be achieving first plasma in their tokamak by just 2025. Then, less than a month later, Oak Ridge National Laboratory reported that their implementation of AI and supercomputing could successfully scale up nuclear fusion and plasma management. Fast forward to October of last year, when the Los Alamos National Laboratory's Plasma Liner Experiment (PLX) announced a futuristic combo of plasma guns, magnets, and lasers for a hybrid approach that could be achieving fusion within the year. And then, in February, Australian startup HB11 began patenting their own laser technology for nuclear fusion all over the world.Whether it's magnets, lasers, or plasma guns that get us there, commercial nuclear fusion is closer to reality than ever, and, once achieved, nearly nothing will ever be the same.By Haley Zaremba for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "As markets plummet around the globe, Malaysia, Belgium, France, Italy, and Spain have all banned the short-selling of some stocks to stanch the market bleeding. The bold moves that halted the short-selling overseas have led some to wonder whether the United States and Canadian regulators may impose similar restrictions to ensure market stability.Dutch regulators are said to also be monitoring financial markets for possible trading restrictions should the need arise.For now, the European Union is asking hedge funds to share more information when they're betting on a stock's decline. Traders must also let regulators know if their net short positions rise to the level of 0.1 percent of a company's net share capital, Bloomberg reported, citing the European Securities and Markets Authority. Previous requirements required funds to notify when they held 0.2 percent in short positions.That the United States could impose a ban or tighter restrictions on short selling is not out of the realm of possibility. In September 2008, the United States SEC banned short sales for almost 1,000 financial company stocks \"to protect the integrity and quality of the securities market and strengthen investor confidence.\"But this time around, oil-related stocks are enticing traders to bet against them, and short-sellers are making a killing. In Malaysia, oil and gas stocks were the target of a one-day short-selling ban earlier this month as oil prices plummeted.Related: Supertanker Rates Soar 678% As Saudi Arabia Floods The Oil MarketAs of a few weeks ago, short-selling on oil had tripled since the start of the year, according to Bloomberg. Since then, oil prices have fallen further.A ban on short selling oil stocks would nix market manipulation and, as the story would go, restore equilibrium to the market. Proponents of short-selling bans in difficult markets argue that rampant short-selling contributes to a stock market price slump, while opponents of bans argue that it is a necessary market tool for adding liquidity to the market.With oil prices down more than 17 percent on Wednesday alone, it will certainly be something the regulators in the U.S. and Canada are considering.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Moves to unlock the full potential of Japan's offshore wind industry are underway with the announcement of a task force set up to accelerate the sector's development. Ambitions are to see the country's renewables share increase from 16 percent to 24 percent by 2030 through a mixture of methods - hydropower being the most sizeable at 9.2 percent and wind coming in at 1.7 percent. The International Energy Agency said last year that by 2040 offshore wind power alone has the potential to meet Japan's total power demand by over ninefold and the world's total electricity demand by elevenfold. Further development of floating turbines could become the world's mainstay power supply.Marubeni Corporation is preparing to launch Japan's first large-scale offshore wind power generation business. Traditionally wind farms in Japan have been small-scale operations but this 100-billion-yen ($894.4m) project will see around 33 turbines at the ports in Akita and Noshiro and be operational by the end of 2022. The two wind farms will have a combined capacity of 140MW and will comprise wind turbines installed on bottom-fixed foundations, and onshore substations. Ultimately it's hoped the electricity generated by the wind farm will support around 47,000 homes. About 20-30 organizations are signing up, with the Japan Wind Association president Jin Kato proclaiming that 2020 will be 'a turning point' for the country's offshore energy production. It follows last year's legislation which permitted the first tenders to take place this year. \"This is an important project as it can serve as a template in the development of the sector going forward,\" says Daniel Mallo, managing director and head of natural resources and infrastructure for Asia-Pacific at Societe Generale CIB, which acted as a senior lender in the transaction. \"The project also demonstrates the spread of offshore wind farming is beginning to happen across the region.\"Related: Saudi Arabia's Oil War Could Bankrupt The KingdomThe barriers to driving the sector such as securing local consent for projects have been criticized by industry sources, who say it prevents them from achieving the potential that Japan has to offer. Yoshinori Ueda, a Japan Wind Energy Association board member said, \"Taiwan decided to work on offshore wind after the Fukushima nuclear disaster and quickly surpassed Japan. Japan is slow. No other country spends as long as five years on environmental assessments. We are requesting that the government take a central role for spearheading offshore wind like in Europe, so that the private companies would only need to build turbines.\"The floating wind farm sector is expected to be worth between PS32bn by 2030, and interest in developing the technologies is high. The Scottish Government recently funded a PS1m competition, run by the Carbon Trust's Floating Wind Joint Industry Project to kickstart work to commercialize the sector. One of the eight companies that shared the prize was Dublin Offshore. Its load reduction device sits partway up the mooring line and pivots in the water to reduce the movement of floating platforms during wave events. Director Darren Hayes told NCE: \"Floating Offshore Wind allows new regions the opportunity to take advantage of the benefits of offshore wind energy and is on the cusp of enormous growth which will contribute significantly to the decarbonization of our energy system\".By Precise Consultants More Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

What's more, the Oregon Department of State Lands refused to grant Pembina an extension to submit documents requesting a permit for sediment dredging at Coos Bay in preparation for the construction of the Pacific Connector Gas Pipeline.The pipeline will transport natural gas from another pipeline that brings it into Oregon from Alberta and then Pembina will liquefy this at the Jordan Cove facility before exporting it to Asia. Its daily capacity would be up to 1.04 billion cu ft of natural gas. The annual capacity of each of the five proposed liquefaction trains will be 1.5 million tons of LNG each.Many would argue now is not the best time to add more LNG capacity, but most companies are betting on a recovery in natural gas markets over the next few years--and Asia remains a key market.

On March 18, the Pemex oil export basket closed trade at $14.54 a barrel, according to a Reuters report, down by more than 22 percent.According to Herrera, however, there is no need to worry. Some 80 percent of budget needs have been covered by the notorious Mexican oil hedge and the rest is covered be unspecified reserves.Earlier this month, Herrero, as cited by Reuters, said the hedge, at $1.4 billion, covered Mexico's oil income completely.\"The hedge is usually not cheap, it is expensive, but it is for occasions just like this. The income part is covered, we will not have a direct impact on the budget,\" Herrera said.The Mexico oil hedge is the most secretive hedging transaction in the oil world and is followed closely by banks as a sort of weathervane for oil prices. A handful of these are directly involved in the hedge: Mexico buys put options on oil from them and from oil supermajors in a series of about 50 transactions.

It failed largely thanks to the extreme generosity of \"yield-starved\" junk bond buyers.Six years later, and another, far more harrowing price war later which dragged the price of oil to nearly two-decade lows, Saudi Arabia appears to have finally won.Texas regulators are considering curtailing oil production in America's largest oil-producing state, \"something they haven't done in decades\", the WSJ reports citing sources. Additionally, the report goes on to note that several oil executives have reached out to members of the Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates the industry, requesting relief following the oil-price crash. In other words, oil is joining every other US industry (including movie theaters) in seeking a bailout.Texas, along with New Mexico, hasn't limited oil production since the 1970s and is the home of the Permian Basin, America's most productive oil field and the epicenter of the shale revolution which started 12 years ago and has made America into the world's top oil producer, with roughly 13mmb/d in output. It has also become Saudi Arabia's top global competitor.Texas was an inconvenience for the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which has sought to control world-wide oil prices in recent decades. OPEC effectively disintegrated last weekend when Saudi Arabia announced it would maximize output, boosting production to as much as 13mmb/d, unleashing panic among higher-cost OPEC oil producers.It is unclear whether regulators will ultimately act to curtail production, but staffers are examining what would be required in such an event.By Zerohedge.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Hydrogen gets a lot of attention as a feasible, green alternative to traditional fossil fuels, and even as the potential solution to commercial nuclear fusion, often referred to as the holy grail of clean energy. Hydrogen can be used as a fuel source for myriad different industrial processes and combustion engines, and when it burns it leaves nothing behind but water vapor. Sounds great, right? While it gets a lot of buzz, however, not all kinds of hydrogen are really a greener option. In fact, a lot of hydrogen is produced by using fossil fuels, primarily natural gas and coal, which means that its use really isn't cutting down on emissions at all. This kind of hydrogen, called \"gray hydrogen,\" is already used in industries and industrial processes such as ammonia production, in refineries and as a feedstock for chemicals.This is what makes green hydrogen such a big deal - not just the hydrogen part, but also how it's made, with zero greenhouse gas emissions on either the production or the consumption end of the supply chain. The only issue is that we haven't yet found an economically viable way to produce green hydrogen without using tons of cash or tons of energy inputs. But we're getting close.For one thing, green hydrogen's buzzworthy nature has gotten a lot of attention from investors, and recently even supermajor oil companies have been heading for greener pastures with new sustainable hydrogen projects. Just last month Royal Dutch Shell announced their involvement in a green hydrogen project involving an offshore wind farm in the Dutch North Sea. What's more, experts are predicting that the biggest obstacle to bringing green hydrogen to market--its capital cost--is about to come down. \"Everybody is predicting that the cost curve will come down, just as it has with solar and wind power,\" Recharge News wrote last month. The article titled \"Why green hydrogen is key to the global energy transition\" continues: \"Though, to get the price point right, you have to reach economies of scale. Then it's just a matter of when the industry is primed to take the next step.\" involvement from major players like Royal Dutch Shell is already getting us closer to that threshold.And now, we may be even closer thanks to a breakthrough this month by a group of Japanese scientists from the Tokyo University of Science, who have managed to efficiently produce green hydrogen in a novel way. While the researchers' paper, \"Hydrogen Production System by Light?Induced a?FeOOH Coupled with Photoreduction,\" published in Chemistry: A European Journal, makes it sound complicated, it actually couldn't be simpler. This green hydrogen recipe's two humble main ingredients are rust and a light source.Related: Russia Needs Higher Oil Prices, But Won't SurrenderIn layman's terms, as translated from science-speak and paraphrased by Science Alert, \"the set-up uses just a few basic ingredients - light from a mercury-xenon lamp, a solution of water and methanol, and a particular type of rust (or iron oxide) called a-FeOOH.\" In the lab, this combination was a smashing success, with a hydrogen yield 25 times greater than existing methods that use titanium dioxide catalysts.\"One of the biggest challenges in hydrogen fuel production is teasing hydrogen atoms apart from other molecules, and keeping them that way without the entire thing blowing up,\" the Science Alert article continues. \"In the new method, by swapping titanium with rust, the hydrogen gas generated seemed to be blocked from recoupling with oxygen, making the separation of the elements easier, and reducing the risk of explosion at the same time.\"This cheap, stable catalyst combo could be the winning ticket to get green hydrogen to market. If so, this would have seriously positive implications for some of our dirtier industries, and any reduction in emissions is a very good thing on the eve of peak oil and catastrophic climate change.By Haley Zaremba for Oilprice.com More Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "title": "COVID-19 Could Spark The Next 'Arab Spring'",
        "content": "The rich are getting richer, inequality is on the rise, and the middle class, the backbone of the US economy since the 1950s, is shrinking. In 2018 the three highest-paid chief executives in the United States earned more than the output of several countries. Tesla's Elon Musk, Brendan Kennedy, the CEO of pot success story Tilray, and Bob Eger, the boss of Walt Disney Co., made a combined $914 million, more than each of 11 countries that rank among the poorest in the world. Celebrities are also raking it in like never before. In 2018 Taylor Swift earned $185 million, Argentinian soccer star Lionel Messi scored $127 million including $35M in endorsements, Mexican boxer Canelo Alvarez earned $94 million, and Swiss tennis star Roger Federer pocketed a cool $93.4 million. Star athletes, Hollywood elites, politicians, the rich, all can get tested for coronavirus before the rest of us (and get backtests in a very timely manner). We, working-class peasants, get sent home, no test done, told to 'self-isolate.' President Trump, when asked about this said 'That's life.' Indeed it is.\"On March 11, the state of Oklahoma used 60 percent of its testing capacity on NBA players and team staff after a member of the Utah Jazz tested positive, allowing them to bypass the long waits endured by ordinary citizens waiting for tests.\"The middle class is eroding - made worse by a drop in the number of middle-income jobs, through off-shoring and automation. The share of adults living in middle-income households declined from 61 percent in 1971 to just 50 percent in 2015. Two-thirds of the 11 percent that were no longer middle class, migrated to upper-income levels, while a third became poorer. And that gap continues to widen. The richest 400 Americans now control more wealth than the bottom 60 percent - it's the greatest rich-poor divide since the 1920s.Globalization backlashGrowing inequality is to a large extent behind the negative reaction to globalization that has been morphing into shape over the past several years. Modern-day globalization is seen as the inter-dependence of national economies through cross-border movement of goods, services, technology, capital and workers. But 175 years of globalization has not resulted in its promised rewards. Income inequality, in the UK and the US particularly, has never been higher, companies have left their home countries to set up factories where labor is cheaper, and the ideal of the European Union offering free movement of labor leading to economic growth has been lost amongst the wave of migrants turning up on European shores. These migrants compete with locals for scarce jobs and are dependent, at least initially, on government handouts. Globalization has also been assailed by automation, in particular the increasing use of robotics in factories, which have displaced thousands of well-paid manufacturing jobs. How did it all go so wrong? In a 2019 column in Marketwatch, Neil Shearing, chief economist at research firm Capital Economics, argues that globalization \"peaked\" even before Trump's trade protectionism resulted in the US-China war, which began in the spring of 2018. He notes that Trade of goods and services, as well as cross-border capital flows, rose sharply as a share of global GDP throughout the 1990s and 2000s but then leveled off from around 2010.Among the reasons Shearing offers for globalization's peak, are the fact that by 2010, most economies were open and no new major countries were left to integrate into the global economy; that new technologies (like e-commerce) made it less attractive for companies to maintain large, complex supply chains; and that governments started to question the benefits of financial liberalization - the most obvious example being China's resistance to opening its capital markets to foreign investment. He concludes that a more malign form of policy-driven de-globalization -- where cross-border trade and capital flows decline as a share of GDP -- is looking increasingly likely....Not just likely, but certain, as shown by the US-China trade war. But Shearing thinks the trade war is only the beginning of a broader backlash against globalization that goes beyond just the United States and China:After all, globalization has undermined the power of national governments and been blamed for rising inequality, multinational tax avoidance and unwanted migration.While the likelihood of a period of de-globalization is underappreciated, it is as yet unclear as to the exact form that this could take. At one end of the spectrum, we could see a mild form of regionalization, in which production is clustered in neighboring countries rather than globalized. At the other end of the spectrum, the world could spilt into competing blocs (for example, one led by the U.S. and another led by China). In between, we could see the growing imposition of tit-for-tat tariffs by individual countries.In other words, a world in which physical walls, and trade walls between countries, is more common - witness Trump's push to extend the wall on the United States' southern border - and impediments to trade within countries, such as the political battle between British Columbia and Alberta, over the right to control the flow of Canadian oil.    Rise of nationalism For many the fruits of capitalism have shown up as spoilt goods. It's harder to buy a house, get ahead, save for retirement. Working people are angry at how globalization has left them behind. Social upheaval is occurring in a greater number of countries. We've seen it in Chile, France, Spain, Germany, the UK (Brexit), Algeria, Iraq, Lebanon, Egypt, Russia, Hong Kong, Venezuela, Chile and Bolivia.Especially in developing nations, ie. South America and Africa, where politicians are  pressured by their base, to enact policies that benefit everyday citizens. Inequality is a key driver of what is often a government-led attempt to download wealth from rich corporations to the poor. Donald Trump and other right-wing populists particularly in Europe such as France's Marine LePen, Viktor Orban from Hungary and Norbert Hofer, leader of Austria's far-right Freedom Party, have said enough of globalization - it's time to go back to the idea of the nation-state, where local workers and industries are protected, and the rest of the world is walled off. Trump's contempt for the UN and other multilateral bodies is an example of nationalism, as was the pro-Brexit movement in the UK which argued that remaining in the European Union was not in Britain's best interest. The Bank of America summarized the anti-global, pro-national shifts in the Trump presidency, just over a year after taking office. They included the imposition of travel restrictions on certain Muslim states; withdrawing from the Paris Agreement on climate change; backing out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership; tearing up and renegotiating NAFTA; imposing tariffs on Canadian paper, washing machines and solar panels; and on imported steel and aluminum. Indeed Trump's 'Make America Great Again' credo is naked nationalism - clothed in the hostility of a trade war with China that has made the Trump administration many enemies abroad, especially in Europe, and put it on a collision course with its largest trading partner. Despite a phase one trade agreement signed in January, hundreds of billions of tariffs on either side remain. It should be noted that nationalism in Europe has for decades been seen as a dirty word, since it was \"national socialism\" in Italy and Germany that gave rise to Hitler and Mussolini. The birth of the European Economic Community through the Treaty of Rome in 1957 was primarily to bury the idea of nationalism in Europe. Its earlier incarnation, the Treaty of Paris of 1951, created the European Coal and Steel Community, whose aim was to pool French and German steel production in order to strengthen Franco-German cooperation and banish the possibility of war. As the European Community evolved into the European Union, European elites stood by a vision of \"the European\" whose characteristics included a preference for free trade, open borders, and so-called progressive ideas like same-sex marriage. Now that is all being questioned, the best example being the 2016 referendum in the United Kingdom, where a majority voted to leave the EU. A 2019 article in the journal 'Foreign Affairs' states: Nationalism and nativism are roiling politics on every continent. With the election of President Donald Trump in the United States, the growing power of right-wing populist parties in Europe, and the ascent of strongmen in states such as China, the Philippines, and Turkey, liberals around the world are struggling to respond to populist nationalism. Today's nationalists decry the \"globalist\" liberalism of international institutions. They attack liberal elites as sellouts who care more about foreigners than their fellow citizens. And they promise to put national, rather than global, interests first.To the average person this \"new nationalism\" has only occurred within the past five years. But a deeper reading of history shows something similar occurred at the turn of the 20th century, when globalization was just starting to gain a foothold in North America and Europe. It's also interesting to place the coronavirus into this paradigm; when you look at closed borders, social distancing, heightened fear and paranoia, suspicion of others, covid-19 is intensifying the inward-thinking, tribal mentality that over the last few years has become \"the new normal\". World War I analogGlobalization could be traced as far back as the 13th century with Marco Polo's adventures on the Silk Road and the establishment of early trade routes through China, the Middle East and Eastern Europe (the Silk Road terminated in Istanbul). European exploration that led to the discovery of the New World in the 1600s was another early manifestation, where thoughts, goods and people (including slavery) were shipped across oceans. The modern idea of globalization took shape in late 19th-, early 20th-century Britain. During this period of global capitalism's infancy, there was a free market for goods, capital and labor. In an oddly prescient remark, famous economist John Maynard Keynes said, \"the inhabitant of London could order by telephone, sipping his morning tea in bed, the various products of the whole earth.\"With economies connected by free trade, globalization proponents thought, wars would be unnecessary - a contemporary version being Thomas Friedman's \"Golden Arches Theory\" whereby no two countries with McDonald's restaurants would go to war. In a Bloomberg opinion piece, Author Pankak Mishra draws an eery parallel between the current state of affairs, and the sudden onset of World War I: The First World War not only brought the period of friction-free globalization to a gruesome end. It also cruelly exposed an intelligentsia which had believed in irreversible progress and now was forced to acknowledge that, as an embittered Henry James wrote to a friend in August 1914, \"the tide that bore us along was then all the while moving to this grand Niagara.\"As with our own crisis, the seminal crashes of the 20th century -- the First World War followed by the Great Depression -- were harder to grasp because their principal causes were set in motion decades before, and largely neglected by mainstream politicians and commentators...Democracy, whether as an emotive ideal of equality or as representative institutions based on a widening adult male suffrage, had steadily become the central principle of the modern world, especially as industrial growth generated new inequalities.Repeatedly frustrated, the aspiration for democracy helped fuel the rise of both left and far-right political movements, pitting them against established ruling elites.The firebrands found their most committed supporters in the exploited populations of then-rapidly growing cities. Filled mostly with people freshly uprooted from the countryside, sundered from traditional livelihoods, and forced to live in urban squalor, the world's great cities had started to become hotbeds of discontent in the late 19th century...Once the series of economic shocks that began in the late 19th century climaxed in the Great Depression, the elevation of the far-right to power, and intensified conflicts between states, was all but guaranteed.In our own conjuncture, all ingredients of the previous calamity are present, if ominously on an unparalleled scale.Take a look around and what do you see? Alt-right populists in power in Europe and the US, and an invigorated nationalism, exemplified by ultra-patriotic leaders each espousing their own form of nativist rhetoric, including Russian President Putin, US President Trump, Chinese President Xi, and Philippine President Duterte. Each is planning on advancing their nationalist agenda unencumbered by the trappings of globalization or multilateralism. One could say that Trump, to a large extent, has succeeded up to this point. However the coronavirus threatens to derail the real estate tycoon's plan for re-election; with only eight months to go, Trump's beloved stock market bull is dead, supply chains are interrupted, and consumer spending which makes up 70 percent of the US economy has fallen off a cliff, amid covid-19 fear. Economies aren't working properly, hampered by the extreme measures taken by governments to contain the virus' spread. Many are predicting a global recession and the dreaded D word (Depression) is being uttered by the most pessimistic. But as Mishra, the Bloomberg author argues, it's all familiar stuff to students of economic history. The media and the politicians have collective amnesia when it comes to recognizing that the prescriptions for multiple malaises have remained the same in much mainstream politics and journalism: more economic \"reforms,\" largely in the direction of global free markets, reheated Cold War slogans about the superiority of \"liberal democracy\" over \"authoritarianism,\" and aspirations for a return to \"decency\" and \"global leadership.\"We see this reflected in the attitudes and decisions of central bankers, who seem to believe that all it will take is another big shot of liquidity, chased down with more interest rate cuts, to beat back covid-19's assault on the global economy. These people are calling the plays from the Great Recession playbook. But they don't realize the game has changed and so has the winning formula.Related: Largest Oil Glut In History Could Force Crude Prices Even LowerHow do zero percent interest rates help the average person not even invested in the stock market? How does the IMF loaning developing nations a trillion dollars, putting them even further in debt, help their impoverished citizens? How does a liquidity injection help people hunkered down in their homes, hoarding groceries, worried about their jobs, paying the rent, covering the heating bill? These are extraordinary times, and extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures.  The main problem, which the coronavirus is exposing with alarming alacrity, is debt.  Indeed as Jayati Ghosh writes in Project Syndicate, even if the pandemic's economic impact is contained, it may have already set the stage for a debt meltdown long in the making... Today's financial fragility far predates the COVID-19 \"black swan.\" Given the massive accumulation of debt in both developed and developing countries since the 2008 financial crisis, it has long been clear that even a minor event - some \"known unknown\" - could have far-reaching destabilizing effects. Yet, until recently, rising asset prices - owing to a long period of extraordinarily loose monetary policies in advanced economies - disguised mounting debt levels. According to renowned economist David Rosenberg, and us at AOTH, the only policy prescription that will work now, is debt default. (To learn how this would roll out, read about our three-step plan to beat covid-19 and fire up the economy through a massive global infrastructure build-out) De-globalization multiplier Over the past couple of months we have been reading regular news reports about how the covid-19 has impacted supply chains. No surprise, considering that China, the epicenter of the outbreak, accounts for 35 percent of global manufacturing output, and is the world's largest goods exporter. Considering China's heft in the world economy, its many trading partners, and regular travel between the Chinese Mainland and the Chinese diaspora settled across the planet, the coronavirus outbreak couldn't have happened in a worse country. The fast-spreading disease that jumped from animals to humans, now infecting about 200,000 people and killing nearly 8,500 in 165 nations, is triggering emergency lockdowns and injections of cash not seen since World War Two. As another recent article in 'Foreign Affairs' put it, The new coronavirus is shaping up to be an enormous stress test for globalization. As critical supply chains break down, and nations hoard medical supplies and rush to limit travel, the crisis is forcing a major reevaluation of the interconnected global economy. Not only has globalization allowed for the rapid spread of contagious disease but it has fostered deep interdependence between firms and nations that makes them more vulnerable to unexpected shocks. Now, firms and nations alike are discovering just how vulnerable they are.Yes indeed. Global trade is for most companies these days predicated on \"just in time\" deliveries. Receiving goods only as they are needed reduces the cost of storing excess inventory and requires producers to forecast demand accurately.Examples include car-parts assembly plants; food distribution networks where fresh produce must be grown, stored, refrigerated and transported to maintain peak freshness; container shipping where goods are transported in multiple modes - ocean carrier, train and/or truck - then arrive at a port to be loaded onto a vessel with minimal delay; and Amazon, which revolutionized online commerce through a highly efficient and robotized system of packaged good delivery.For most companies, most of the time, JIT works very well, as long as there are minimal disruptions to the chain of supply, all the way from the material in its rawest form, down to the finished product that is delivered to the end user. It is for the most part an efficient, cost-effective, common-sense way to run a business. Enter a disruption, however, and the average JIT system falls apart quickly, and spectacularly.When JIT fails, the negative effects on production lines, delivery schedules and especially on a company's reliability, can have a severe impact on operations and involve a number of unexpected and hidden costs or fees. Worse, there is no fail-safe alternative for when a supply chain breaks down.Previously, goods would move throughout a regional or national economy. Globalization has created an intricate web of interdependence, with national economies subsumed into a vast global network of suppliers. Foreign Affairs gives the example of car manufacturers in Europe worried about shortages of small electronics because a single manufacturer was forced to suspend production at one of its plants in Italy. Global production of laptops reportedly fell as much as 50 percent in February, cell phone shipments could be reduced by 12 percent next quarter.In fact, the breakdown in supply lines, supposedly made more efficient by globalization, is becoming in some places a matter of life and death. In Seattle, hospital workers ran out of surgical masks and have been fashioning protective gear from office supplies.  Reagents, a crucial part of coronavirus testing kits, are running low or out of stock in several countries. The shortfall has delayed the production of test kits in the United States - adding to the pressure on the White House for being too slow to jump on containment measures. Supplier dependence is also being exposed by covid-19. The Chinese government bought up the country's entire supply of masks from local manufacturers who supply half of the world's medical masks, causing a supply crunch in other countries in need, including the United States. Foreign Affairs states: These beggar-thy-neighbor dynamics threaten to escalate as the crisis deepens, choking off global supply chains for urgent medical supplies...Related: Is It Time To Buy The Blood On The Streets?As policymakers around the world struggle to deal with the new coronavirus and its aftermath, they will have to confront the fact that the global economy doesn't work as they thought it did. Globalization calls for an ever-increasing specialization of labor across countries, a model that creates extraordinary efficiencies but also extraordinary vulnerabilities. Shocks such as the COVID-19 pandemic reveal these vulnerabilities.Harvests at risk One of the most alarming effects of the pandemic, likely visible to every single shopper who has been to the grocery store in recent days, is the prospect of a complete break in the grocery supply chain, resulting in a food shortage. Assurances from grocery giants like Loblaws, that supplies will flow unimpeded (we already know that isn't true, otherwise why so many empty shelves?) haven't stopped widespread hoarding, as residents confront the reality of being confined to their homes for weeks, through a government-imposed \"shelter in place\" order. Food producers aren't so sanguine. They're worried about how international travel restrictions will prevent migrant workers from traveling out of their home countries, places like Mexico and the Caribbean, to work at fruit/ vegetable farms and slaughterhouses of developed countries. The problem is fast becoming an issue, as spring planting time in the Northern Hemisphere nears. \"If our borders are closed for a short period of time, even to the migrant workers, there will be trouble getting the crops in for the season,\" said Steve Bamford, president of Toronto Wholesale Produce Association, quoted in a CBC article, Wednesday. \"It's a huge impact for our growers -- not just Ontario, but nationwide. There is no way that we would be able to farm without our migrant workers. I can't put it any clearer than that,\" he said. \"We will run into a big food security issue if that happens.\"News reports last week were already warning about higher produce prices. Growers in China, Australia, New Zealand and the United States are also concerned their migrant workers will be grounded. Kiwi pickers in New Zealand are reportedly in short supply, travel curbs may cause shortages of some vegetables in Australia, and in Canada, meat processors that rely on temporary foreign workers to fill chronic labor shortages are threatened. Italy, currently in lockdown, with a health care system overwhelmed by the number of covid-19 cases, employs around 370,000 workers from abroad during the spring harvest - which as luck wouldn't have it, has come earlier this year. Border restrictions threaten a lack of agricultural labor. In Germany, asparagus and strawberries could be left rotting in the fields. There won't be anyone to harvest the crops,\" Bloomberg quoted Robert Guenther, senior vice president for public policy for the United Fresh Produce Association. \"It will be devastating to growers and ultimately to the supply chain and consumers. They won't have the food.\"Just let that sink in for a moment. They won't have the food? A supply pipeline that has run uninterrupted for, well forever, something we North Americans absolutely take for granted, could be about to spring a leak, in the form of foreign workers, unavailable to do the jobs Canadians and Americans consider beneath them. Labor mobility is touted as one of the best things about globalization. Not so, when borders are closed, and local workers aren't trained or aren't willing to pick fruit and veggies for a wage. Arab Spring? It doesn't take a large leap of logic to see what could happen next. With fruit, vegetables and meat either too expensive or simply unavailable, due to shipments being canceled or delayed, there could be long line-ups to get into grocery stores when they open.Those lucky enough to get their beef, chicken, carrots and bananas will be okay until the next shipment. What happens to the unlucky ones? The prospect of food riots is not hard to imagine. Remember, the Arab Spring started over a shortage of bread. When grain prices spiked in 2007, bread prices in Egypt rose 37 percent. Chronic unemployment meant more people depended on subsidized bread, but the government didn't make any more available. This led to social unrest that eventually unseated President Mubarek.The Tunisian uprising started in more dramatic fashion, when a young man running a vegetable stand set himself on fire to protest corruption. Many believe his act of self-immolation was the start of the Arab Spring. Conclusion Could border closures owing to covid-19 lead to bread riots in the streets of Vancouver, Calgary, Winnipeg and Toronto? It seems implausible yet... who could have predicted the wild events of the last two weeks? When people are starving, all bets are off the table. A Canadian Arab Spring? Why not? The coronavirus is provoking a lot of fear and anxiety but it is also showing the vulnerabilities of global supply chains which are only as strong as the weakest link. When just-in-time deliveries fail, every link in the chain is affected, from the very top to the very bottom. Covid-19 is a good opportunity to look at back-up plans, and it's also a wake-up call to the financial system's vulnerability which, as we have shown, is so over-leveraged that we are literally on the edge of debt catastrophe. The world appears to be teetering on a precipice but it's one of the best times I've seen in a long time for investing in precious metals.By Richard (Rick) MillsMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "While U.S. crude oil imports from OPEC and Mexico have slumped over the past decade and a half, crude imports from Canada have more than doubled due to the price and refinery operational advantages, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Thursday.Last year, Canadian crude oil imports into the United States accounted for more than half, or 56 percent, of total American crude imports, EIA's Petroleum Supply Monthly showed. Imports from Canada averaged 3.8 million bpd in 2019, more than double the U.S. imports from its neighbor to the north in 2005.At the same time, American imports of crude oil from OPEC's Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, as well as from Mexico, significantly dropped between 2005 and 2019, mostly due to the surge in U.S. crude oil production over the past decade, the EIA said.In 2005, U.S. oil imports averaged a record 10.1 million bpd, 60 percent of which came from Canada, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela. Each of those oil producers held a market share of between 12 percent and 16 percent, as per EIA data.Related: The New Saudi Plan To Send Oil Prices LowerBy 2019, Canada's exports had more than doubled to 3.8 million bpd, seven times larger than the volumes the U.S. imported from OPEC's top producer and the world's largest exporter, Saudi Arabia - 500,000 bpd. U.S. oil imports from Mexico averaged 599,000 bpd last year, six times less than the American imports from Canada, according to EIA's monthly data from 2019. Venezuelan imports were virtually nonexistent for most of the year after the U.S. slapped sanctions on Venezuela's oil industry.Since the start of 2020, the U.S. was a net exporter of crude and petroleum products in each of the weeks in January and February, EIA data showed earlier this month.The United States exported more crude oil and petroleum products than it imported in September 2019--the first month in which America was a net petroleum exporter since monthly records began in 1973, the EIA said at the end of last year.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "title": "European Gas Demand Growth To Crash On 'Lockdown' Fears",
        "content": "European gas demand in 2020 is likely to drop by 0.7 percent compared to our pre-coronavirus forecast, according to Rystad Energy's most likely scenario. Growth will be limited to just about 2 billion cubic meters (Bcm) year on year, short of previous expectations for a 6 Bcm increase.The continent's gas demand for last year is calculated at 554 Bcm and Rystad Energy has now revised its 2020 forecast to 556 Bcm, down from 560 Bcm before coronavirus-related restrictions were put in place.Rystad Energy's most likely scenario assumes most of the continent's countries go into lockdown for 30 days during the two-month period of March and April. As people stay home and businesses close their doors, demand will decrease for power generation and for burning in the industrial, commercial and residential sectors.The two months will see a combined total loss of 4.1 billion cubic meters (Bcm) in expected demand, a 4.4 percent downgrade compared to our pre-coronavirus estimates. That would translate to Europe's total demand being limited to 89.2 Bcm from a previously expected 93.3 Bcm for the period.Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands and Spain are will take the biggest hit in absolute volumes.Related: Oil Plunges As Saudis Boost Exports To Record High\"During the last few days the likelihood of seeing further lockdowns across Europe has increased making this scenario more likely. Also, Italy is about to end its second week of lockdown and it doesn't seem to be coming to an end yet. It is therefore probable to see reduced commercial and industrial activity in countries for a period of at least four weeks,\" says Carlos Torres Diaz, Rystad Energy's Head of Gas and Power Markets.If lockdowns last for only two weeks, which Rystad Energy now finds increasingly unlikely, European gas demand for the above two-month period is set to be 1.8 percent lower, or down by 1.7 Bcm, versus what Rystad Energy expected before the virus appeared.During the duration of the lockdown, power consumption is expected to drop 7 percent overall leading to a similar drop in gas demand from this sector. Gas use for industrial consumption is set to decline 5 percent, for commercial consumption 20 percent and for residential consumption 2 percent.Rystad Energy's estimates do not yet assume any demand loss due to lockdowns from May onwards, which of course carries a significant downside risk in the case coronavirus-related restrictions in Europe intensify.The implications of this bout of lower consumption could have a substantial effect on the region's balance between now and the end of April. Buyers will most likely adjust down their share of pipeline imports to the extent possible and will also reduce imports of spot LNG cargoes.The lockdown measures come at a time when European gas prices are already at a record low as a result of the abundant supplies available to the region, combined with lower demand due to the mild winter, and underground stock levels at historically high levels.Related: Have These High-Reward Oil Plays Become Too Risky?\"With TTF front-month prices currently trading below $3 per MMBtu we see limited downside risk, given that at a lower price, exporters of US spot LNG cargoes would not be covering their short-run marginal cost and would rather divert cargoes to other regions, or adjust down production,\" says Torres Diaz.However, there is a risk of seeing prices drop to a level of $2.3 per MMBtu for a short period of time while the necessary adjustments to balance the market occur.The current environment reduces the expectations of seeing a recovery in gas prices any time before next winter. Overall, we believe that there should be enough interest and regasification capacity from Asian buyers to take additional LNG supplies as the current price level continues to be competitive versus coal which could help prices remain stable at $3 per MMBtu throughout this year's second quarter.By Rystad EnergyMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "The UK's oil and gas industry has called on the government to help the sector as it faces three separate challenges, that could see production plummet.Oil and Gas UK (OGUK) highlighted coronavirus, gas prices being halved and the sinking oil price as threats to the industry.Boss Deirdre Michie highlighted the need for key skills in the sector to be maintained in the face of uncertainty and requested urgent meetings with ministers to establish a response to coronavirus.\"The offshore oil and gas sector is part of the UK's critical infrastructure, providing the secure and affordable energy the country needs and is a key contributor to the economy in terms of supporting hundreds of thousands of skilled jobs, businesses and our wider economic contribution,\" she said. In its new business outlook report, OGUK warned production could fall to the lowest level since 2016.That's a third below previous forecasts and could give firms negative cash flow this year.There could also be a 20-30 percent reduction in capital expenditure across the industry this year.OGUK said supporting the sector is key to the UK's future energy supply.Michie also warned the industry's supply chain is particularly exposed.A volatile pictureNatural gas prices have halved in the past year and the oil price is at a 30 year low.It is currently trading at around $30 a barrel.This has been caused by the coronavirus and the price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia.The pandemic has led to wide-ranging travel bans including from the EU to the US.Several major airlines have either cancelled flights or ran them far below capacity.This has been at the same time as the oil price war between Russia and Saudi Arabia.At a meeting earlier this month, OPEC and Russia, known as OPEC+, could not agree with an oil supply strategy.Related: Is $10 Oil On The Horizon?Saudi Arabia and its allies including the UAE have dramatically increased oil supply.\"At this time innovative thinking, partnerships and meaningful collaboration will be required to help as many as possible to weather the storm,\" said Ross Dornan, OGUK market intelligence manager.Analysts have suggested this could lead to the price of oil reaching as low as $20 a barrel.This is because the Saudi strategy is likely to continue for some time.By CityAMMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "title": "Major Credit Agency Slashes Oil Price Outlook To Reflect A Record Glut",
        "content": "Fitch Ratings has slashed its short- and medium-term oil price assumptions, expecting a record glut in 2020 that will keep the market off balance at least in the next two years.  Fitch slashed its average base-case 2020 price assumption for Brent Crude to $41 a barrel from $62.50 expected before the coronavirus pandemic and the OPEC+ deal collapse. For WTI Crude, Fitch now assumes an average price of $38 per barrel this year, down from an earlier assumption of $57.50. In Fitch's stress-case scenario, Brent Crude is expected to average $36 a barrel while WTI Crude is seen averaging $33 per barrel in 2020. The enormous demand destruction from the coronavirus outbreak and the all-out oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia will lead to a massive record-breaking oversupply on the market this year, according to Fitch Ratings. \"This could keep the Brent price below USD40/bbl for the rest of this year, as the magnitude of oversupply in 2020 in various scenarios is likely to be much larger than the maximum of 1 million barrels a day (mmbpd) seen in the past decade,\" the credit rating agency said.  Fitch sees the market gradually rebalancing over the next two-three years when demand will have recovered from the pandemic, U.S. shale would have declined because of unsustainable current prices, and OPEC possibly forging a new deal as both Saudi Arabia and non-OPEC Russia would feel the pain from their oil price war. Related: Russia Needs Higher Oil Prices, But Won't Surrender\"Both Saudi Arabia and Russia, the key parties to OPEC+, have fiscal break-even Brent prices above current market prices, at USD91/bbl and USD53/bbl, respectively,\" Fitch said. Apart from slashing near and medium-term price assumptions, the rating agency also cut its long-term assumptions \"to reflect continued efficiency gains, low break-even oil prices of many greenfield projects and a potential for demand to slow due to energy transition.\" For the long term, Fitch's current assumptions are Brent at $55, down from $57.50 expected earlier, and WTI at $52 a barrel, down from $55 previously.

        "title": "Tanker Rates Explode As Markets Brace For Record Oil Glut",
        "content": "The largest oil supply surplus the world has ever seen in a single quarter is about to hit the global market from April, creating an imbalance of around 10 million barrels per day (bpd). An exclusive Rystad Energy analysis shows global storage infrastructure is in trouble and will be unable to take more crude and products in just a few months.Our current liquid balances show supply surpassing oil demand by an average of nearly 6 million bpd in 2020, resulting in an accumulated implied storage build of 2.0 billion barrels this year.Based on our rigorous analysis, we find that the world currently has around 7.2 billion barrels crude and products in storage, including 1.3 billion to 1.4 billion barrels currently onboard oil tankers at sea. We estimate that, on average, 76% of the world's oil storage capacity is already full.There is essentially no idle storage capacity available on tankers, as Saudi Arabia and other producers might have already wiped out the available population of Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCC) for March and April 2020. Our data shows that the theoretical available storage capacity at present is just 1.7 billion barrels onshore for crude and products combined. Using our estimate of an average of 6.0 million bpd of implied oil stock builds for 2020, in theory, it would take nine months to fill all onshore tanks. However, in practice we will hit the ceiling within a few months due to operational constraints.Related: Canada Prepares Multi-Billion Dollar Bailout For Its Oil Industry\"The current average filling rates indicated by our balances are unsustainable. At the current storage filling rate, prices are destined to follow the same fate as they did in 1998, when Brent fell to an all-time low of less than $10 per barrel,\" says Paola Rodriguez-Masiu, Rystad Energy's Senior Oil Markets analyst.Floating storage normally uses VLCCs, which can carry about 2.0 million barrels. We estimate that there are about 802 VLCCs active globally with a combined capacity of 250 million deadweight tonnage (dwt), capable of collectively storing 1.8 billion barrels. The entire global fleet, including smaller Suezmax and Aframax vessels, is estimated to have a combined capacity of 630 million dwt or 4.6 billion barrels.Related: Saudi 'Shock And Awe' Is Crushing Shale DrillersHowever, to keep oil flowing between regions, a ballast of around 50% is necessary as cargos often need to travel with no cargo to the destinations where they pick up oil, meaning that at any given time around half of the world's fleet is booked traveling to consumer destinations, while the other half is empty on their way to pick up oil. This reduces the number of available vessels to about 57.In addition, the workable available capacity is significantly lower as many of these vessels are under long-term charter deals or locked in ownership agreements, such as COSCO vessels with PetroChina. Waiting time at ports and repairs further shrinks the workable available capacity.Due to the above-mentioned factors, using supertankers to float oil offshore might not be a viable option this time, as the planned OPEC+ output hike has not only limited the workable available vessels but also caused a surge in tanker freight rates. The cost of renting a VLCC on the spot market has risen from about $20,000 per day last month to between $200,000 and $300,000, depending on destination.\"We find that liquid supply will have to be reduced by around 3.0 million to 4.0 million bpd compared to the current production planning to bring the implied stocks builds closer to 2.0 million to 3.0 million bpd for 2020, which is the level of implied stocks build that we find sustainable in the short to medium term,\" Rodriguez-Masiu concludes.By Rystad EnergyMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "U.S. oil supermajor ExxonMobil has reduced the run rates at its second-largest refinery in the United States, Baton Rouge in Louisiana, after slumping fuel demand has filled storage tanks, sources with knowledge of the operations at the 502,500-bpd refinery told Reuters on Monday.Exxon reduced the production processing rate to some 440,000 bpd on Saturday, and the number of contract workers was reduced by 1,800 on Friday, Reuters sources said. The Baton Rouge facility typically employs around 2,000 contract workers.The Baton Rouge refinery is Exxon's second-largest refinery and the second-biggest refinery in the state of Louisiana.  Demand for fuel in the United States, and across the world, is taking a major hit as people are asked or ordered to stay at home as countries grapple with the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. Oil demand in the United States is set to tumble over the following weeks, as cities are under lockdown, non-essential businesses and services are closed, and people are asked to work from home wherever possible.  Considering that the United States is the largest consumer of crude oil in the world, consuming 19.96 million bpd--or 20 percent of the world's total, demand in the U.S. alone is set for a steep decline while states and the federal government fight with the growing cases of Covid-19 infections. In the U.S., the transportation sector is the backbone of oil demand, accounting for 9.329 million bpd of all petroleum products consumed in the U.S. in 2018, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA).Europe consumes around 7 million bpd of the world's crude oil demand, or 7 percent of the typical 100-million-bpd demand, and although this demand is smaller than the one in the U.S., European oil demand is plummeting as all major economies, including the worst-coronavirus-hit Italy, Spain, France, and now Germany, are under lockdown, with travel strongly discouraged.Refining operations in Europe and elsewhere in the world are being curtailed as gasoline and jet fuel demand is falling off a cliff due to the enormous demand destruction in the spreading coronavirus pandemic.In Europe, oil majors are shutting down refinery units as major economies are under lockdown and flights are severely restricted, Reuters reported on Friday, quoting sources and industry data provider Genscape.

        "content": "Rising refinery capacity, strategic inventory filling, and flat domestic production resulted in China importing record volumes of crude oil last year, an average of 10.1 million bpd, up by 900,000 bpd from the 2018 average, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said in an analysis on Monday.China continues to be the world's largest importer of crude oil after surpassing the United States in 2017.  This year, the coronavirus pandemic has disrupted Chinese fuel consumption and has upended previous estimates about Chinese crude oil imports, refinery operations, and domestic consumption.\"The economic and transportation effects from this outbreak are still developing and will likely affect China's crude oil imports, refinery runs, and domestic consumption through the second quarter of 2020,\" the EIA said today.Last year, the majority of Chinese crude oil imports, or 55 percent, came from OPEC, the EIA analysis based on the China General Administration of Customs and Bloomberg showed.Although OPEC's top producer and the world's top oil exporter, Saudi Arabia, boosted its crude oil exports to the world's largest oil importer China in 2019, the overall share of OPEC in Chinese imports slumped to its lowest level since at least 2005, according to the EIA.  The reason for the lower Chinese imports from OPEC was not only the OPEC+ pact, but also the U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela, whose sales in China have drastically dropped. Saudi Arabia was the single largest oil supplier to China last year, with 16 percent of all Chinese imports, followed closely by Russia with a 15-percent share, EIA's data showed. Russia was also the largest non-OPEC supplier to China in 2019, followed by Brazil which overtook Oman as the second-biggest non-OPEC supplier. China's crude oil imports from the United States fell in 2019, due to the trade spat and the Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods, including crude oil.

        "content": "Militants attacked on Monday a town in African country Mozambique close to large liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects under development, local police said, as quoted by Bloomberg.Early on Monday, unidentified militants occupied by the city of Mocimboa da Praia, which is located 38 miles, or 60 kilometers, south of LNG projects being developed by major oil and gas companies including ExxonMobil and Total, Orlando Mudumane said  on state television, Bloomberg reports.This is not the first time that gunmen have attacked areas close to LNG development projects in the African country. Last year in February, for example, militants attacked Anadarko's LNG project, in what was the first such attack on the local oil and gas industry.  Later in the year, Total bought Anadarko's 26.5 percent operated interest in the Mozambique LNG project for US$3.9 billion,  after it reached a binding agreement with Occidental to buy Anadarko's assets in Africa, following Occidental's acquisition of Anadarko.In November last year, Total was looking to develop additional trains to develop the gas resources in the area.Exxon, for its part, is jointly developing the Rovuma LNG project in Mozambique with Italy's Eni.   ExxonMobil will lead the construction and operation of all future natural gas liquefaction and related facilities, while Eni will continue to lead the Coral floating LNG project and all upstream operations, Exxon says on its website.While a militant attack at a town close to LNG developments in Mozambique may hamper some of the local operations, LNG developers and sellers face an uncertain future these days as an oversupplied market and slowing demand in the coronavirus pandemic may delay final investment decisions for new projects.   There were 10 liquefied natural gas projects in the United States slated for approval last year but due to an already sizable glut and the U.S.-China trade war, many final investment decisions were pushed into 2020. Some of these projects might even be canceled if the situation doesn't improve soon.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Occidental Petroleum is nearing a deal with activist investor Carl Icahn who launched an offensive against the company's management after the acquisition of Anadarko, sources in the know who wished to remain anonymous have told Reuters.Icahn was among the most vocal critics of the US$38-billion takeover of Anadarko, in which Occidental beat Chevron. The deal was supposed to cement and expand Occidental's position as the largest oil producer in the Permian after it incorporated Anadarko's acreage, which comes in at some 600,000 acres gross in the Delaware Basin, part of the largest and most prolific shale play in the United States.The activist shareholder warned that the acquisition, for which, according to him Oxy had paid too much, could turn sour in case oil prices fell. It seems he may well have been spot on. West Texas Intermediate has slumped to less than $23 a barrel since the start of the month after Saudi Arabia announced it was turning the oil taps to maximum.Occidental's stock price went with it. Related: Saudi Arabia's Oil Price War Is BackfiringFrom close to $38 per share at the end of February, Oxy has plunged to a bit over $10 as of Friday. This gave it a market cap of just $9.16 billion, as everyone with exposure to U.S. shale is slashing spending and conserving cash.Now, Occidental's executives are negotiating with Icahn and a deal could be inked before the end of the month, according to the Reuters sources. It will give two board seats to Icahn associates and give the activist investor the power to name a third independent director. This means the company has caved to the pressure, agreeing to give Icahn a bigger say in important decisions such as acquisitions.Meanwhile, Oxy is tackling its $29-billion debt pile. According to a Bloomberg report from last week, the company has started contacting debt and equity investors to find ways for easing the load.

These, however, will only service medical, food transport, and utility vehicles.Venezuela, which has been fighting spiraling inflation and a prolonged collapse of its oil industry, has now faced another challenge: the Covid-19 pandemic. Over the last two weeks, Bloomberg reports, the country has had 70 confirmed cases. While not as many as other countries have seen, these could be just the beginning, and many are worrying the government may not be prepared enough to tackle this new challenge.There are 1,600 fuel stations in Venezuela, and this is not the first gasoline shortage the country has experienced since its economy went downhill amid the last oil price collapse, the tumble accelerated substantially by U.S. sanctions targeting its oil industry.Last year in May the suspension of gasoline imports from the U.S. led to shortages as local production also slumped because of the lack of diluents--also imported--to make the extra heavy Venezuelan crude easier to refine. Since then, the gasoline shortages seem to have become chronic and will now only worsen.The Bloomberg sources did not say whether the shutdowns will extend to the capital Caracas, which in the past has been spared the worst effects of the crisis to keep citizen disgruntlement at bay.Meanwhile, the U.S. has continued to step up the pressure on the Maduro government. Last month, Washington sanctioned the trading arm of Russia's Rosneft for dealing in Venezuelan oil. Now, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday, the administration has opened criminal investigations against two former PdVSA officials in preparation for another round of sanctions.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

If the UK takes more measures to curb domestic travel, around 40 percent of Europe's 7-million-bpd demand is at risk, Serio told Reuters.Global oil demand is set to plunge by more than 10 percent from the typical 100-million-bpd consumption, as the raging coronavirus pandemic forces countries into lockdown, the executive said.Falling demand, including jet fuel demand, may force Japanese refiners to cut run rates, Takashi Tsukioka, president of the Petroleum Association of Japan (PAJ), said on Thursday. Japanese refiners are stocked with crude for April and don't have much room to take extra barrels from Saudi Arabia, regardless of how cheap the flood of additional supply will be, Tsukioka told a news conference, as quoted by Reuters.

It serves as a distraction, as an escape from what can sometimes feel like an endless flow of fear and dread. For just a brief moment, sport allows you to forget about those problems in the world that you're powerless to control and instead get swept up in an insignificant drama that means the world to you. Coronavirus has led to the shutdown of every single sporting event in the world. Even the most famous Formula One race in Monaco just got canceled (Monaco's prince himself caught the virus), and fans are going stir crazy, stuck in self-quarantine... desperate for a distraction. Luckily... There is one sport that is ready to provide just that. The only major sport that has found a way to get in front of its fans even while they are locked away at home.The sport is racing, and the innovative company we have to thank for its return is Torque Esports.Sports fanatics, brace yourself. Your favorite distraction is about to return, and it's got a new twist. The Race All-Star Esports Battle is a simulator racing event that includes drivers from Formula One, IndyCar, Formula E, and e-racing professionals. It is a unique event that allows us to see who the best driver in the world really is. The debate has raged amongst racing fans for years, with F1, NASCAR and IndyCar all having claims to being the most difficult form of racing. Well soon, we may have a definitive answer.The inaugural Race All-Star Esports Battle took place last Sunday and broke almost every record going for esports racing live. The race itself saw more than 23 years of combined content consumed and had 30,000 comments from fans.Aside from attracting more than one million viewers, the race featured some of the most famous drivers, with Formula One star Max Verstappen, Indy 500 winner Simon Pagenaud and FIA Formula E points leader Antonio Felix da Costa all taking part. But experience showed in the end when the race was won by esports racer Jernej Simoncic.The Biggest Racing Event Of The SeasonThis week, the race is on and the superstars are back to get their revenge, with Max Verstappen and Antonio Felix da Costa returning alongside names such as world-famous F1 driver Juan Pablo Montoya, and IndyCar champion and Indy500 winner Tony Kanaan.If you had any plans this coming Saturday then cancel them. Racing season is back on, and it's going to be unlike anything you've ever seen.Click here to get details on tomorrow's race.The Esports BoomEsports has exploded in the last few years, with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) buying industry leader Twitch for nearly $1 trillion. Though there's little information on the true numbers that Amazon generated from the deal, with over 2.7 billion hours streamed in a single quarter in 2019, it's safe to say that it's a pretty decent amount.And as esports continues to explode, one of the biggest game publishers in the world, Electronic Arts Inc. (NASDAQ:EA), is trying something a little different. EA is launching a cloud streaming service, Project Atlas, that will allow players to stream games directly onto their game platforms. A surprise trial of the project occurred on September 9. The service is meant to compete with Google's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Project Stream, the building block for a service called Stadia.And major brands like Pepsi and Nike are already trying to get in on the action. PepsiCo. (NYSE:PEP), for its part, has become the exclusive non-alcoholic beverage provider across aa number of Madison Square Garden properties, including Counter Logic Gaming, one of the leading North American esports organizations.

However the Department of Interior has existing authority to temporarily reduce or eliminate royalties set forth in the leases in the Western and Central planning areas of the Gulf of Mexico,\" Congressman Dan Crenshaw of Texas wrote in a letter to the Secretary of the Interior, David Bernhardt, as carried by Houston Chronicle.\"We urge you to consider the viability of a temporary reduction in royalties,\" Congressman Crenshaw wrote.Reducing royalty payments for companies could help some firms reduce the number of layoffs in Texas and the Gulf Coast, he argues.In the wake of the crashing oil prices, every U.S. energy firm, including supermajor Exxon, plans significant cost cuts and capital expenditure reductions to try to adapt to the new reality of oil in the $20s.Texas is also weighing whether to curtail oil production in the heart of the U.S. oil industry, in a first such move in decades, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, quoting sources with knowledge of the deliberations.Related: Oil Prices Retreat After Massive RallyEarlier this month, U.S. President Donald Trump directed the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to begin solicitation for buying 77 million barrels of oil from American producers to remove some of the overhang on the market, fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to its maximum capacity with the cheapest oil in years, and help oil producers.    DOE launched on Thursday the process to buy an initial volume of 30 million barrels of oil, mostly from small to midsize producers, in a bid to provide relief to the American energy industry.Apart from buying for the SPR, the Trump Administration is considering other relief measures for U.S. oil producers, including tax relief.According to Bloomberg, the Administration is also weighing the idea to cut royalty rates for oil and gas production on federal land, but this idea will likely meet opposition not only from Democrats, but also from some Republicans who have said that federal royalty rates are too low.

Meanwhile, in Italy, which has now surpassed China's death toll with what is now the deadliest coronavirus outbreak in the world, electric power demand has slumped an impressive 7 percent, oil demand has dropped 7 percent globally along with a massive oil price crash, and in the United States, where the worst of the virus hasn't even hit yet, the gross domestic product is projected to contract at a rate of 5 percent in the coming quarter.While some sectors are crashing, however, others are picking up the slack--and then some. Millions of people around the world are learning to use Zoom and Slack and a myriad of other home office services as they begin to work from home. \"In South Korea, Italy, and Seattle telework and residential internet usage have soared 40% in just weeks,\" tallies a Forbes report. \"In France 80% of internet traffic is now Facebook, YouTube, and Netflix, and providers are pledging to ensure 'digital discipline.'\" Internet usage, by the way, is still largely powered by fossil fuels.Yes, telecommuting is not a new invention. Lots of people have been doing it for years, and the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics documented that 24 percent of the U.S. workforce worked from home in the last year, continuing a nearly decade-long trend of workers setting up their home offices. Related: How Chevron Could Win Big On \"The Worst Oil Deal Ever\"While these trends are not novel, \"coronavirus isolation has already boosted that, and could be a watershed event for digital connecting,\" says Forbes. These new legions of telecommuters, their tablet-happy toddlers, and kids adjusting to attending school online are eating up huge amounts of bandwidth. This translates to a lot of families around the world ponying up a lot of money for their internet package and electricity bills as we head into what is certain to be a particularly brutal recession. And that's just one side of the equation. For their part, business owners may be thrilled to be offsetting a lot of the costs associated with running an office in these months of lockdown. \"After the virus clears and we're left with a recession, landlords may have a hard time convincing corporate tenants to keep paying pricey overhead for employees who still got the work done, remotely,\" says Forbes. \"It can cost $20,000, according to JLL, to kit out the average 150 square feet of office space per worker. And, depending on your city, $300 or more per employee per month for rent, plus $50 per employee per month in supplies and snacks, and $20 per month to keep the lights on, air-conditioned and computers charged.\"But that silver lining that you can finally see as the smog clears? That still stands. As telecommuters, well, telecommute, they will be driving their cars a whole lot less. This translates to much fewer carbon dioxide emissions, to be sure, but it also translates to a lot less gas. The dip in gas demand by your average citizen, not to mention all the oil-based industry that's currently shut down around the world, also means that oil prices, which have already taken quite a tumble, will remain low. Good ol' supply and demand. This will mean a lot of savings for a lot of workers in the U.S. and around the world--hopefully enough to lighten the blow of all the other costs workers will be taking over for their bosses.By Haley Zaremba for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "title": "Can Afghanistan Avoid Civil War?",
        "content": "A deal has been recently struck in US-Taliban peace talks and progress towards long term peace seems increasingly possible. However, with a likely NATO withdrawal and recent election results, there continues to be a substantial risk to the country's security and the likelihood of descent into civil strife.Election result confirmed yet disputedLast month it was announced that Ashraf Ghani had been successfully and legitimately re-elected as Afghanistan's president. Ghani received 50.64% of the vote while Abdullah Abdullah, his main political rival and his chief executive officer, received 39.52% of the vote. Abdullah heavily disputed the legitimacy of the result and the entire electoral process, forcing a recount.The recount has posed a potential threat to the delicate position of the peace talks between the Taliban and the US. Abdullah has declared that he is setting up a parallel government of his own, spelling danger for the intra-Afghanistan negotiations which will take place between the Taliban and the government after the start of the withdrawal of NATO forces. A fractured government and a potential for a 'Ghani-Abdullah' power struggle may allow for a united Taliban to gain the upper hand in negotiations.Outcome of US-Taliban talks and beyondThe deal made between the US and Taliban delegations in Doha, Qatar on the 21st of February focused on a 7-day 'reduction in violence' in return for the withdrawal of US troops. The two parties agreed to several 'good-faith' transactions to ensure a de-escalation in the use of arms. One of these agreements was for the Taliban to commit to a '7-day nationwide reduction in violence' before the US signed the deal on the 29th of February. Further conditions to the agreement included possibilities of releasing insurgent prisoners as long as safe havens for transnational terrorism was prohibited throughout Taliban territory.Related: What Happens If Oil Prices Go Negative?US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, claimed that once the deal was signed, intra-Afghan negotiations would begin and would \"build on this fundamental step to deliver a comprehensive and permanent ceasefire and the future political roadmap for Afghanistan.\"However, the US-Taliban talks have not involved any Afghan government officials at any stage. It has led to fears that the US could prioritize a simple military withdrawal over a complex political settlement, which in turn could risk the humanitarian and socio-political gains that have been made since 2001.Direct talks are supposedly going to begin between the Afghan government and the Taliban since the US confirmed the deal two weeks ago. Yet, problems have immediately arisen, with Ghani refusing the release of Taliban prisoners that were supposedly promised by US negotiators. Hence, observers have repeatedly raised concerns about what sort of political arrangement will be able to be negotiated to ensure an end to the insurgency and armed conflict which will satisfy both the Taliban and Kabul.Regional interestsSeveral factors now provide Iran with an opportunity to gain influence. Firstly, Soleimani's replacement, Ismail Qaani, has extensive experience and knowledge of Afghanistan and the Taliban, which will strengthen Quds forces in their activity in the country. Secondly, NATO withdrawal from Afghanistan signals removal of a physical US presence which Tehran will most likely capitalize on. Thirdly, intra-Afghan talks that are likely to be fractious and chaotic will position Iran well to gain diplomatic influence among the competing groups.Related: Do Saudi Arabia And Russia Really Want To Kill U.S. Shale?Pakistan, who has had a close relationship with the Taliban, will be monitoring any strategic moves Iran makes to gain influence with the group. Islamabad played a crucial part in bringing the Taliban to the negotiating table and will hope the intra-Afghan talks will prove productive in finding a long term solution to the governing of their western neighbour. A close relationship with a government in Kabul has for a long time been a strategic desire for Islamabad with regards to its rivalry with India. Both Iran and Pakistan want to secure stability for their neighbor, but mistrust between the two may cause clash points further down the line.China and Russia, who also share a border and history with Afghanistan respectively, have their interests in how the intra-Afghan talks play out. Strategic rivalry between China, Russia, and the US will mean Beijing and Moscow will be attempting to take advantage, economically, politically, and militarily while the US is bogged down in what could be a complicated troop withdrawal.Future outlookPrimarily, the US will want to make sure they get some sort of return on the length of time, investment, and loss of life since 2001. Having secured this deal with the Taliban, the US will now concentrate more on efficiently removing forces from around the country over the next 14 months. Trump is keen to see an end to the Afghanistan war and anticipates a timely US withdrawal will prove popular amongst the electorate with the presidential election coming up later this year in November.In the short term, the intra-Afghan talks will commence, but a neutral host must be decided upon. Germany, Norway, Qatar, Uzbekistan, and Indonesia are currently the frontrunners to provide for these talks however, the respective governments are presently vying for the political benefits hosting such a negotiation could give them. This may cause an unnecessary delay to what are already going to be extraordinarily complex and sensitive negotiations. Considering the COVID-19 international crisis, Afghanistan will also be dealing with containing the outbreak that is prevalent on its western border with Iran. The ongoing political crisis in Kabul could further complicate any challenges involved in this effort.A critical question that now must be confronted is: what form will a united Afghan government take, and how will it approach talks with the Taliban? For the talks to be productive and result in a long term solution, the government must be seen as legitimate and supported by Afghan citizens. How long this will take is unknown, but the longer the country does not have a unified government, the longer the talks may be delayed. There is a risk that if the negotiations proceed too quickly, the divergent ambitions of the Ghani and Abdullah governments will cause significant damage to any authority the elected government still has in reinforcing their negotiating position against other actors.In the medium term, there is ample concern that the uncertainty that typifies the Afghan political situation will lead to an armed conflict between the competing factions. It is well known that there is deep mistrust between the Taliban and the current Western-backed government, and this will prove a significant barrier throughout the talks. If talks breakdown between both parties or within each party and progress seems unattainable, violence and further conflict are likely.By Charles Williams via Global Risk InsightsMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Despite calls for immediate suspension of oil and gas drilling lease sales on federal land amid slumping prices, the U.S. will hold lease sales this week in four states, Reuters reported on Tuesday. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), part of the Department of the Interior, has slated for Tuesday and Thursday lease sales in four Western states: Montana, Nevada, Wyoming, and Colorado, according to the tentative schedule of BLM.   Conner Swanson, a spokesman for the Department of Interior, did not reply to a Reuters request for comment, but had said last week that the lease sales on federal land were \"being evaluated on a case-by-case basis.\"In Wyoming, BLM Wyoming has proposed to offer 105 parcels in the March 2020 quarterly oil and gas lease sale. Those parcels total about 118,219 acres, BLM Wyoming says, noting that the state is one of the top U.S. energy producers on public lands. In 2018, BLM Wyoming raised nearly US$117 million through oil and gas lease sales.   Typically, a total of 48 percent of lease sale revenues go to the state, while the remainder goes to the U.S. Treasury, the BLM said. Lease sales are one of the pillars and critical contributors to the Trump Administration's America-First Energy Plan. However, the sharp drop in oil prices over the past week has had some organizations concerned that the U.S. taxpayer will not be getting a fair return on oil and gas leases. Last week, conservative and taxpayer groups called on the U.S. Administration to suspend lease sales on our public lands for the rest of the year amid the current oil glut, depressed prices, and systemic fiscal weaknesses in the leasing process.  \"In this environment, it is impossible for the American taxpayer to expect anywhere near a fair return on oil and gas leases. This is due to more leases selling at the minimum bid amount, or worse, at the even lower non-competitive lease rate. Just last week, the administration held a lease sale for public lands in Utah where nearly 90% of acres sold received the minimum bid of $2 per acre. In addition, oil produced during a depressed market brings in fewer royalties,\" nonpartisan budget watchdog Taxpayers for Common Sense (TCS) and Conservatives for Responsible Stewardship (CRS) said in a statement.

        "title": "Oil Crash Makes Coal The World's Most Expensive Fossil Fuel",
        "content": "Coal has long been a staple of many of the world's major economies because it's always been cheap and abundant. Despite all the environmental and public health issues that are associated with the dirty fuel source, such as its high levels of carbon emissions and choking air pollution that has plagued industrial centers and cities like Beijing and New Delhi, coal has continued to be a mainstay in the world energy mix thanks to its efficiency and low price point. As coal has fallen out of fashion in Europe--and to a lesser extent, the United States--it's still going strong in much of the world. In fact, in Asia, coal consumption has even been on the rise. Even developed countries with lofty renewable energy goals have been unable or unwilling to wean themselves off of coal, with Japan as a particularly salient example of this trend. After the nation's confidence in nuclear energy was shaken by 2011's fukushima nuclear disaster, Japan surprised many by making a major return to coal. Australia has also remained a highly active player in the coal sector, and stands as the world's biggest coal exporter--a distinction that they are loath to give up, even after this year's devastating climate change-fueled bush fires.But now, against all odds, coal has suddenly become the most expensive fossil fuel in the world. This in large part thanks to this month's spectacular oil crash,which has sent oil prices far below their standard benchmark levels. Earlier this month oil prices suffered their biggest single-day drop since 1991, as the spread of coronavirus joined forces with Saudi Arabia and Russia's oil price war to form a perfect storm of market-spooking headlines. That's why, according to reporting by Bloomberg this week, \"the global crude benchmark is now priced below the most widely traded coal contract on an energy-equivalent basis.\" as of last friday, \"Australia's Newcastle coal on ICE Futures Europe settled at $66.85 a metric ton, [...] the equivalent of $27.36 a barrel of oil. Brent futures ended at $26.98 a barrel.\" This means that coal is now the world's most expensive fossil fuel as well as the dirtiest, \"emitting about twice as much carbon dioxide as natural gas and 30% more than gasoline when burned.\" Will this be what the world needs to finally kick its coal habit? Maybe. It all depends on whether this new price point reversal is here to stay.Related: Saudi Arabia's Oil Price War Is Backfiring\"The new top price ranking, which is more a function of the sudden drop in crude prices than a surge in coal demand, must be sustained to incentivize switching plants and investments away from coal,\" says Bloomberg. \"In the short term, coal use in Japan could fall marginally this summer in favor of cheaper LNG, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\"Coal isn't just having trouble competing with other fossil fuels, however. In September of last year Oilprice was already reporting that solar and wind were more affordable than coal in two-thirds of the world, as costs plunged for renewable energies and the solar and wind sectors outgrew their subsidies. Now, just this month, Forbes reported that it's now cheaper to build new renewable energy projects than building a new coal plant \"in every major market in the world.\" The article's title says it all: \"Clean Power Crowds Out Dirty Coal As Costs Reach Tipping Point.\"Forbes' reporting is largely based on another strongly titled report by financial think tank Carbon Tracker, \"How to waste over half a trillion dollars: The economic implications of deflationary renewable energy for coal power investments.\" The report, as paraphrased by Forbes, makes a strong case for divesting from coal, as \"even for coal power plants that are already built and in operation, it would be cheaper to build new clean power capacity than produce power from those coal facilities in 60% of cases.\" What's more, \"by 2030 at the latest, it will be cheaper to build new wind or solar capacity than to continue operating coal in every single market in the world.\"All this is to say, that even if oil prices soon recover and once again overtake coal, making it a more affordable option once again, the writing is on the wall. It's just a matter of time before coal just no longer makes sense by any metric. For that matter, when environmental and public health externalities are factored in, coal has never really made much sense. It's time the market acts like it.By Haley Zaremba for Oilprice.com More Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "title": "European Refiners Brace For Coronavirus Impact",
        "content": "Given the rapidly evolving situation, our short-term data shows indications of changes, or sometimes potential delayed impacts, in behaviour, pricing dynamics, and associated opportunities. Traders are quick to react to profitable situations. Even if some of the major oil trading companies are scaling back, other independent traders are only a mobile phone call away from securing a lucrative arbitrage cargo or a storage play that locks in some revenue for the next few months.Crude Storage Opportunities One of the first opportunities was the opening of storage economics, both onshore and offshore in most locations. As European derivative benchmarks switched into contango over the last few weeks, reports suggest crude storage continues to be the primary focus. Perhaps this is because crude prices fell faster and sooner than in the product markets.Longer-term storage has more favorable economics, with Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) rates over a six-month period returning a profit compared to the futures price curve over the same period.ICE Brent spent most of late February in backwardation and only moved into contango in early March. Initially, our vessel tracking noticed three aframax-sized cargoes delaying movement from the North Sea during the week ending March 13. Our data showed crude oil inventories in ARA declined over 4mn bbls, or, eight percent of the total measured volumes, in the week ending March 13. Unused, operations shell capacity we monitor is an additional 40mn bbls.Figure 1: Storage in the ARA region. Source: GenscapeLikewise, crude inventories at Dalmeny, where Forties oil is stored in Scotland prior to vessel loading, were also low, although it has started to build between March 15 and March 18. There remains over 1.5mn bbls of ullage at this location. Forties crude is also supplying INEOS' 210,000 bpd Grangemouth refinery, which took an additional 300,000 bbls between March 16 and March 18, as well as loading onto ships at Hound Point where cargoes were loaded for long-haul destinations in South Korea and China, according to our Supply Chain monitoring.Related: Saudi Arabia's Oil Price War Is BackfiringIzki Loaded March 11 to March 15 with ~1,977,000 bbls to Rizhao, ChinaElandra Everest Loaded March 3 to March 7 with ~ 1,857,000 bbls to Yeosu, South KoreaAdditionally, one vessel, the Front Jaguar, was stopped, potentially indicating floating storage. The Front Jaguar loaded approximately 565,000 bbls of Forties crude on February 28 with Rotterdam as the declared destination, but the vessel had not departed the Port area, as of March 19, according to our data.Stateside, our Cushing storage data showed inventory levels at the lower end of last year's range, measuring just under 50 percent capacity utilization, for the week ending March 13.Long haul freight rates are spiking higher, having been relatively low over recent weeks. The demand from Asia is recovering to an extent, and the western hemisphere is now starting to see extreme demand erosion. Long-haul economics make more sense in contango markets, and there are reports of trading houses chartering large vessels for storage. Glencore is said to have chartered an Ultra Large Crude Carrier (ULCC) to store 3mn bbls of crude oil and Shell to have chartered at least two VLCCs. There may be enough available ullage in shore tanks, but it will soon dissipate with very low crude demand and increasing output from Saudi Arabia and Russia continues unabated. The use of floating storage is mostly expected to be in Asia.Refined Product EconomicsICE Gasoil futures were backwardated for the last month and flipped to contango on Thursday, March 12, too soon for the economics to be reflected in our storage data for the week ending March 13. Genscape-monitored Gasoil/ULSD inventories in ARA fell 330,000 MT, or seven percentage points, dipping to a relatively low 52.6 percent capacity utilization. Our waterborne analysis expects gasoil/ULSD volumes arriving from the Baltic region to fall again next week, further driving inventory declines in the ARA region. Our shipping analysis predicted stock draws at Rotterdam and Antwerp, as regional exports outpaced imports in the week ending March 13, which gave a timely insight that measured storage volumes would fall in these locations.However, volume net flow into Amsterdam rose in the week of March 4, resulting in a small stock build in this location. Barge volumes from ARA to inland Germany were higher recently, perhaps a sign of households looking to restock as outright prices fall. A total of 343,000 MT of gasoil/ULSD from ARA entered the Rhine by barge on March 13. There appear to be no significant delays caused by coronavirus (COVID-19) at this time, according to our Rhine Barge Report.ARA jet storage was below 2019 levels year-over-year, and stocks drew a further 48,000 MT to 761,000 MT for the week ending March 13, leaving 47 percent of operational capacity unused. Reports suggest continued inflows to Northwest Europe are expected for the time being, despite huge cuts to aviation travel in recent days. Although some of these volumes may be blended into other distillate grades like gasoil and ULSD, long-term storage economics are challenging. Jet degrades faster than other oil products, and the assumption is that after about three months the product cannot be used for aviation. We will continue to closely monitor stocks in ARA as they are likely to build faster and sooner than offshore storage.Figure 2: Jet loadings to Northwest Europe and the Mediterranean by loading month. Source: GenscapeGasoline time spreads only slipped into contango on March 12. We reported ARA gasoline stocks rose 29,000 MT, or 1.6 percent, for the week ending March 13. Capacity utilization was around 58 percent, while stocks increased over recent weeks as summer grade product is stored in preparation for a seasonally higher demand period. Our waterborne analysis continued to observe reasonable flows of gasoline heading trans-Atlantic, with 600,000 MT moving that way in the week to March 13, only marginally lower than the previous week.Gasoline volumes to West Africa fell from their elevated levels of the past few weeks. Our latest data shows less than 400,000 MT loaded for this region in the week of March 13. Storage volumes offshore West Africa rose slightly to just over 1.1mn bbls, according to our European Waterborne Products report. The excess volumes from the middle of February were cleared as crack spreads began to fall, and the crude-for-product swap contracts looked enticing to African importers of gasoline.Refinery BehaviourRefinery maintenance has gathered pace in Europe since the start of March. However, there is still little evidence in this region that turnaround projects will be altered due to coronavirus or finance-related issues. In the United States, there are several delays from this year to next for these reasons. Another possibility we are looking out for in our data is evidence of reduced refinery runs if workers are unable to be on site. This was evident in China as the outbreak of coronavirus began, but for now, we have yet to hear of such in Europe.Related: Oil Majors Are Preparing For $10 OilOur data reported unit outages at 15 of the monitored sites as of March 18 All but three of these outages were in line with expected maintenance programs reported by the companies or media sources. Two large maintenance programs slated for early May remain on schedule as of now, at Neste's 206,000 bpd Porvoo refinery in Finland, and Shell's 404,000 bpd Pernis refinery in the Netherlands.Total announced they were suspending maintenance work at their 117,000 bpd refinery in Feyzin, France due to COVID-19. If others follow suit or postpone upcoming maintenance, then refinery runs could increase in the coming weeks. However, with refinery margins around breakeven, this would be short-lived as less profitable refineries cut runs and close units.Whilst there is no reliable short-term refined products demand data available in Europe, our Supply Side data reports daily and hourly rack activity (transacted liftings from secondary terminals to retail stations) across the United States. Some effects on demand from coronavirus were observed in the U.S. West Coast (PADD 5) throughout the first half of March, where containment efforts started earliest. Interestingly, no significant downturn was observed in the other large markets of the U.S. at that time. As precautions to avoid large crowds are increasingly taken, early data indicates a time lag before such containment changes daily driving behavior, and the degree of response varies among cities.Applying similar logic to Europe implies that mainland European demand would have started falling last week, and that product demand in the United Kingdom would not be impacted to any great extent until this week.Figure 3: U.S. average weekly month demand.

According to an impact analysis from Rystad Energy, oil and gas firms could reduce total project sanctioning this year to just $61 billion at Brent Crude average of around $30 per barrel in 2020. This spending forecast compares to previous estimates from Rystad that as much as $190 billion worth of investments would be sanctioned this year. Of the $61 billion investments expected to receive approval this year at $30 oil, half would be onshore and the other half offshore, according to Rystad Energy, which sees Brent at average $30 \"an increasingly likely scenario.\" \"Upstream players will have to take a close look at their cost levels and investment plans to counter the financial impact of lower prices and demand. Companies have already started reducing their annual capital spending for 2020,\" Audun Martinsen, Rystad Energy's Head of Energy Service Research, said in a statement. From U.S. shale producers to Big Oil, everyone in the industry is bracing for pain at $30 oil, and companies are rushing to announce capital expenditure (CAPEX) cuts. One of the major projects expected to receive final investment decision this year is ExxonMobil's Greater Liza development offshore Guyana, which encompasses the Payara and Pacora discoveries, according to Rystad Energy. But in North America, \"multi-billion dollar oil projects, including LLOG-operated Shenandoah Phase 1 and the Shell-operated Whale development, could face short-term delays in the offshore sector due to low oil prices, while in the onshore sector operators are expected to wait for the situation to stabilize before committing to new projects,\" Rystad Energy said.

        "content": "Italy has gone full \"Wuhan\" with a massive lockdown across the country amid a virus crisis that has paralyzed its economy. So far, 63,927 confirmed cases of COVID-19 had been reported, with 6,077 deaths.The Italian economy is being dragged into a depression as the fast-spreading virus cripples its northern regions, forcing the government to ban travel and close all industrial production across the country.The impact of the virus on Italy's economy led to the collapse of electricity consumption last week. Electricity usage fell 16% YoY for March 16-22, according to Bloomberg calculations based on Terna SpA data.Diego Marquina, an analyst covering European power markets at BloombergNEF, noted on Monday that electricity demand in every European country has declined due to the impact of quarantine measures to mitigate the virus spread.Marquina said if declining electricity consumption is \"sustained...weekday power demand would most likely fall to Sunday levels - a 10-26% reduction, depending on the country.\" He estimates that power prices could drop between 6-18 EUR/MWh.Last week, power demand in Italy fell 17% below the average for the week. The average reduction in demand was -11% in France, -9% in Belgium, and -7% in Spain.Marquina expects a decrease in power prices across Europe if mass quarantines continue, which would transform weekday demand to Sunday levels for some countries.Courtesy of Capital Economics, which has compiled alternative data on Europe, traffic congestion in Rome and Milan, has been well below average since a countrywide lockdown was initiated in early March. Similar to Bloomberg's data, Capital Economics is also showing a collapse in electricity consumption as major manufacturing hubs across the country remain shuttered into late March. The next country to see collapsing electricity demand could be the US as strict social distancing policies, enforced by federal and state governments are likely to send the economy into a depression in the second quarter.By Zerohedge.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

It will certainly do no good for the industry's reputation. But help in the form of waivers for non-critical regulatory requirements might help cushion the blow that, according to analysts, will lead to bankruptcies and potentially massive layoffs in a worse repeat of the 2014-2016 crisis.Trump is in an awkward position, however. On the one hand, cheap gas at the pump is attractive to voters. On the other, the oil stocks crash caused by the price slump has dragged the whole market down, and this is not so good for voters.

The rarefied world of the extravagantly wealthy has lately come under serious assault with the billionaires club seeing its fortunes rapidly shrink in the ongoing stock market rout. About ten days ago, South China Morning Post reported that the world's 500 richest people had collectively lost $950 billion in the stock markets since the beginning of the year. The stock selloff has accelerated since then with the MSCI World Index--a market-cap-weighted stock market index of 1,644 stocks from companies across the globe--dropping another 320 points, or about 15 percent of its value. This implies losses by the billionaires have likely now crossed the $1 trillion mark. It also means the world now has only one centibillionaire, Jeff Bezos, after Bill Gates and the club's latest entrant, Bernard Arnault, saw their fortunes slip below the $100-billion mark. Arnault, chairman of French luxury goods titan LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE, became the world's third centibillionaire after LVMH stock climbed nearly 40 percent in 2019. LVMH is down 27.7 percent in the year-to-date.Source: MSCIWarren Buffett was the biggest victim of the rout, with the Oracle of Omaha seeing his net worth drop by $9.6 billion to $66.4 billion after Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) Class A shares dropped 8.6 percent on Wednesday alone. BRK.A shares are down a whopping 25 percent in the year-to-date with the vehicle's top holdings Delta Airlines (NYSE:DAL) and American Airlines (NYSE:AAL) down 63.5 percent and 63.8 percent YTD, respectively. Airline stocks have been particularly badly hit as governments everywhere urge citizens to keep travelling to a minimum while others have placed an outright ban on international travel. Many large U.S. airlines spent most of their free cash flow on share buybacks over the past decade in a bid to goose their earnings even as profits soared. Unfortunately, this left them exposed with many facing bankruptcy in lieu of a government bailout.Facebook Inc.'s (NASDAQ:FB) Mark Zuckerberg has taken a $6.8 billion hit in the stock markets,  after FB stock dipped 27.1 percent YTD on concerns about lower ad revenues from retail, travel and recreation clients. Related: April Could Be Worst Month Ever For OilZuckerberg's net worth has now shrunk to $55.7 billion though he seems to be taking it on the chin after  Facebook announced a $100 million grant for small businesses impacted by the coronavirus pandemic.After a bright start to the year, Microsoft Inc.(NASDAQ:MSFT) has not been spared the latest bloodbath with the stock dropping nearly 14 percent over the past week and taking down Bill Gates' and Steve Ballmer's net worth $6.6 billion and $5.7 billion, respectively.  Gates' net worth of $96.3 billion still places him as the world's second-richest person, a position he had previously ceded to Bernard Arnault. Meanwhile, Arnault's riches have shrunk to $80.7 billion after LVMH's poor stock performance.Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) relatively tame -0.14 percent YTD return means that Jeff Bezos has lost far less than most of his super-rich peers, with his net worth estimated at $113.9 billion. Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) CEO, Elon Musk, however, has not been so lucky. After previously dismissing the coronavirus panic as \"dumb,\" Musk has been forced to eat humble pie after Tesla was deemed \"not an essential business\" by the sheriff's department and forced to close both its Fremont, California, and Buffalo, New York, factory factories where it assembles EVs. Musk, however, has pledged to make ventilators if there was a shortage, joining GM and Ford. The Trump administration has already handed the three automakers the green-light to make ventilators and other metal products. Whereas retooling an auto assembly line could be a tough call, the auto companies do have 3D printers for components; Tyvek suits used in paint shops that could be repurposed as well as \"clean rooms\" in other plants that could meet FDA standards. Market in TailspinThe US stock market has gone into a tailspin over the past two weeks as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to wreak havoc everywhere with three states locking down more than 70 million people. Meanwhile, a much-anticipated government bailout failed to materialize after the senate failed to advance a third economic stimulus package meant to help the American economy weather the coronavirus pandemic. Hot on the heels of passing an $8.5 billion bill, congressional lawmakers proposed yet another coronavirus \"rescue\" package dubbed The Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) with a running price tag of $1.5 to $2 trillion. Although the bill passed with overwhelming support in the House of Representatives, the Senate was unable to vote because several Republican senators are currently self-quarantining. Senator Rand Paul has already tested positive for the disease while another four senators have self-quarantined after possible exposure.Any further delays in passing the bill could mean an extended stocks selloff--and more misery for the billionaires.By Alex Kimani for SafeHaven.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Researchers from Germany's Centre for Solar Energy and Hydrogen Research Baden-Wurttemberg, known by its initials ZSW, just launched the ZellkoBatt, a project aimed at optimizing large-format lithium-ion cells for automotive applications, while cutting the costs of components as well as manufacturing processes.In a press release, the scientists said they will apply the results of their efforts to ZSW's pilot production line, a research lab that has been up and running since 2014 under factory-like conditions. The resultant machines and processes will then be ramped up for mass manufacturing. The idea is to build bridges between working prototypes and industrial mass manufacturing in domestic factories.\"Electric mobility is going to significantly change the automotive supplier industry,\" Margret Wohlfahrt-Mehrens, who heads accumulator research at ZSW, said in a statement. \"We have to do everything in our power to fast-track the development and production of battery systems to future-proof Germany as an auto-making nation. With the ZellkoBatt project, we are extending our technological infrastructure to accelerate the transfer of innovative battery cells to industrial mass manufacturing.\"According to Wohlfahrt-Mehrens, the project should help the country move beyond pilot manufacturing lines and small production runs, establish manufacturing capacity and meet the growing demand for batteries, particularly taking into account that the government has set the goal of increasing the electric vehicle count to up to 10 million by 2030.

        "date": " Mar 23, 2020, 4:30 PM CDT",
        "title": "The Single Biggest Threat And Opportunity For U.S. Utilities",
        "content": "This is the question that a venerable  publication catering to utilities and regulators, Public Utilities Fortnightly, asked: \"When will climate change represent a tangible threat to utilities?\"Our first reaction was, \"When? Haven't they noticed yet?\" Then we asked ourselves, \"Why only a threat? Why not also an opportunity?\"Here is the threat scenario. The US electric utility industry will, at some point, have to retire its fossil-fueled power generating stations. Billions of dollars worth. At present, these assets are owned by corporations, munis or co-ops but they are ultimately the financial responsibility of utility ratepayers. However, this financially attractive state of affairs presupposes that utility customers remain connected to the grid. If the \"cord cutters\" movement spreads from the cable to the electric utility industry, the ability to recover costs and earn a return on underappreciated plants may gradually erode if more and more consumers choose to disconnect from the network. If customers install solar panels, windmills or whatever, they will no longer require the services of the local utility. And this does not pertain solely to residential load. Large commercial and industrial loads, with enormous electrical requirements but equally enormous financial resources, may also choose to build their own generators and networks. Communities also have the ability in many places to establish microgrids that would also fully displace the local utility. If enough consumers at all levels choose to \"grow\" their own electricity, which is now technically and financially feasible, then there is no need for the local electric utility. It goes the way of the trolley or the T-Rex. Both extinct.Well, the electric industry will have to write off plants, especially coal-fired units that utilities removed from rate base and gave to unregulated affiliates in the hope of making big money, but regulators have generally permitted utilities to recover write-offs of regulated plants.In addition, climate change will force utilities to move or otherwise abandon assets in low lying riparian locales as well as harden plants for future climatic disturbances. While just a trickle at present, our utilities also must confront possible wholesale movements of the population out of a portion of the service area. Related: US Oil Turns Its Back On The Permian As Prices CrashNow, look at the other side of the coin. First, the big, utility-scale renewable projects cost less than on-site small facilities. Of course, they require battery backup and this storage is costly right now. Second, individuals with renewable resources still by and large need electricity backup provided by the franchise owning utilities. The price of off-grid, energy independence is rather high if it entails solar plus adequate battery storage. Third, and this is the key issue, will consumers desiring clean, sustainable electricity gradually begin to require that it be homemade or locally sourced? Or is it adequate that their local utility provides energy that is clean, sustainable and reliable?  If the former is the case, then electric utilities and their investors are in for a world of hurt as the saying goes. If it's the latter, then utility managers are staring at a huge business opportunity. There are no easy risk-free choices here as far as management is concerned.Here's the problem. The utility industry seems to have settled into the notion that it can assume a rather leisurely pace in winding down its fossil power generating assets. Companies touting a green generating fleet by 2050 are in essence committing to the status quo for another generation. If we are to believe Energy Information Administration projections and the generally complacent signals we get from industry leaders, an attitude of --\"Let's do it carefully. Let's not do anything that will cause financial dislocation for the companies that will eventually get us off fossil fuels. Let's not endanger existing investment\"-- is prevalent.We see two risks with the existing complacency. First, electric companies exert considerable political influence. However, we are not certain that the political winds will remain propitious for another generation long replacement cycle involving fossil fuels. It is not unthinkable that \"clean energy\" remains politically resonant with politicians who in turn commit to some program of regulatory reform. This could easily mean that a new generation of gas-fired power generating assets are written off at shareholder expense long before the end of their useful lives.Second, the enormous incremental electricity demand of a gradually electrifying transportation sector -- both for capacity and new infrastructure -- may be the biggest market opportunity the electric industry has had in decades. We doubt that people will buy clean, green electric vehicles in order to consume \"dirty\" electricity. As a commodity, we have long argued that \"branding\" or marketing electricity like other consumer products was a mistake. This may no longer be the case as both consumers and corporations make their preferences clear. Related: Rig Count Plummets As Oil Price War Rages OnWe have worked through the numbers more than once (see columns on Feb.18 and March 14). It looks as if the US electric utility industry will have to spend $4.5 trillion to decarbonize and another  $2.5-$3.5 trillion to replace its aging plants with modern equipment. We believe the electric industry can reduce its carbon emissions by two thirds without dislocation (after which it gets harder). And this would put the industry on a solid financial footing for the future without government money -- unlike every other industry in the US it seems. The price increase to consumers to pay for a new, green electric infrastructure remains in the modest single digits. These are levels we believe state regulators would find manageable even under economically straightened circumstances. Right now, substantial incremental investment in electric infrastructure, for \"greening\", hardening, resilience and replacement looks like a huge opportunity. Simply stated, regardless of the environmental path taken, US electric companies will spend trillions of dollars on capital equipment in the next twenty years as the industry enters an asset replacement cycle. Why not do it right and commit to an accelerated phase-out of aging fossil assets and a new-build replacement cycle with emphasis on renewables?

        "title": "Goldman Sachs Backs A Major Rebound In Gold",
        "content": "A month ago, Goldman Sachs suggested there is more to come for precious metals as with rates getting closer to their lower bound, gold looks increasingly like the safest haven.At the start of March, Goldman's head of commodity strategy said there is one commodity that will be safe: gold \"which - unlike people and our economies - is immune to the virus.\"And now, Jeffrey Currie and Mikhail Sprogis are saying The Fed's \"open ended\" QE reverses funding stresses and will offset the negative impact from lower EM demand:\"We are likely at an inflection point [for gold] where 'fear'-driven purchases will begin to dominate liquidity-driven selling pressure as it did in November 2008.\"As such, Goldman raises both the near and long-term gold outlook, saying they are \"far more constructive,\" reaffirming their 12-month target of $1,800/oz.In 2008, the turning point for bullion was the announcement of $600b QE in November, after which gold began to climb despite further weakness in equities and commodities.A similar pattern is emerging as gold prices stabilized over the past week and rallied as the Fed introduced new liquidity injection facilities.Goldman's full note below:1) We have long argued that gold is the currency of last resort, acting as a hedge against currency debasement when policy-makers act to accommodate shocks such as the one being experienced now.So why has the gold price fallen? The answer is the world is short dollars.First, both physical and financial market participants face severe funding constraints; they have been forced to sell liquid positions which include gold and other commodities to generate dollars for other funding needs (see Exhibit 1).Second, large falls in the price of oil have created dollar shortages for emerging market (EM) economies. This has become particularly apparent with the Russian central bank in the past several weeks as the oil price decline shifted Russia from a net buyer of gold to a possible net seller.Related: This Supermajor Is About To Slash Permian Oil ProductionWe believe that yesterday's announcement from the Fed for 'open ended' QE reverses these funding stresses and offsets the negative impact to EM wealth and are recommending buying December 2020 gold.2) Gold has been severely impacted by liquidity issues, correcting by $120 (-7 percent) from its peak.The situation resembles 2008, when gold also failed to act as safe-haven asset initially, falling by around 20 percent due to dollar strength and a run into cash. In 2008, the turning point was the announcement of $600bn QE in November, following which gold began to climb despite further weakness in equities and commodities (see Exhibit 2).We are beginning to see a similar pattern emerge as gold prices stabilized over the past week and rallied the last two days as the Fed introduced new liquidity injection facilities with this morning's announcement.3) We analyze gold through the prism of our 'Fear and Wealth' framework, where 'Fear' of currency debasement is the primary driver of developed market (DM) investment demand while 'Wealth' is the primary driver of EM purchases.Debasement 'Fear' is often, but not al ways, correlated with US long-term real rates (see Exhibit 3).With funding stresses likely eased, focus will likely shift to the large size of the Fed balance sheet expansion, increase in fiscal deficits in DM economies as well as issues around the sustainability of the European monetary union.We believe this will likely lead to debasement concerns similar to the post GFC period. Accordingly, we are likely at an inflection point where 'Fear'-driven purchases will begin to dominate liquidity-driven selling pressure as it did in November 2008. As such, both the near-term and long-term gold outlook are looking far more constructive, and we are increasingly confident in our 12-month target of $1800/toz.4) While 'Wealth' is likely to continue to be a headwind for gold, particularly in the near term as oil prices, EM growth and EM currencies remain under pressure, China and other parts of Asia are showing reassuring signs of recovery.Last week we reduced our 6-month gold price target by $50/toz to $1700/toz to reflect the impact of lower EM 'Wealth', and we believe this has already been reflected in current gold pricing. Continuing to draw on the 2008 parallel, we believe that the increase in 'Fear'-driven investment demand is likely to trump the negative 'Wealth' shock in the near term (see Exhibit 4).As gold demand can be deferred as opposed to permanently lost like energy demand, we expect as Asian EM economies stabilize, EM gold demand will rebound strongly as consumers make up for missed purchases, particularly for speculative purposes as they have done in the past when chasing a trending market (see Exhibit 5).5) However, the wealth outlook for commodity-rich EMs is not as optimistic in the near term, but their demand for gold is not as large as that from the Asian EMs.So while we are comfortable being long gold, it doesn't mean that our FX strategists believe that the dollar shortages are behind us or that we would want to be long other commodities. As we have argued in the past, given the size of the global oil market, a drop in the oil price of recent magnitudes accentuates dollar shortages as oil and commodity prices are highly correlated with the accumulation and dissipation of EM excess savings (see Exhibit 7).Financial markets normally transform these excess savings into greater global liquidity, supporting asset valuations and improving credit conditions globally. Hence, when weak commodity prices create a draw on EM savings they act as a drag on financial conditions and a headwind on gold prices as dollars become more scarce. Accordingly, the negative oil-dollar price correlation has been re-established (see Exhibit 8).Related: Saudi Arabia And The U.S. Could Form The World's Newest Oil Cartel6) Ultimately, once their GDP stabilizes, EM consumers should help prolong the current 'Fear'-driven bull market in gold.Drawing one last parallel to 2008, while EM wealth continues to be under pressure due to the reasons cited above, once the COVID-19 crisis abates, we see potential for sequential improvement in Asian EM growth to lead DM out of the crisis as it did in 2008/09. This China-driven growth will likely give rise to inflationary concerns given the sharp expected contraction in oil and other commodity supply like agriculture and livestock. Combined with the fiscal nature of the current policy response to COVID-19, we believe physical inflationary concerns with the dollar starting near an all-time high will for once dominate financial asset inflation that was a feature of the past decade. Such inflationary concerns should further support gold prices as the currency of last resort.So, Gold, which a WSJ \"expert\" idiotically called a \"pet rock\" back in 2015...... is according to Goldman the last thing and only thing that might store value, namely \"the currency of last resort and avoids the concern that paper currencies could be a medium of transfer for the virus. As a result, gold has outperformed other safe haven assets like the Japanese Yen or Swiss Franc\" a trend Goldman sees continuing as long as uncertainty around the full impact of COVID-19 remains, which will be the case for a long time, and is also why gold is currently the best performing asset class YTD, a \"once in a decade event\" as the last time this happened was back in 2010.By ZerohedgeMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "title": "China Is Stockpiling This Ultra-Cheap Oil Blend",
        "content": "Rock-bottom prices and predictions of a massive plunge in global oil demand for this year are seeing China buy up record tonnes of Russian oil, temporarily vindicating Moscow as it persists in its stubborn market share war with the Saudis.  Reuters reported on Wednesday that China is scooping up 1.6 million tonnes of Russian Urals grade oil for loading over the next month. That's 400,000-tonne-plus increase over January loadings. Russian Urals grade is too cheap to resist at this point, losing nearly 9% on Wednesday, to hover in the $21/barrel range. Soure: Oilprice.comBut it's not all roses for Russian Urals. There's a trade-off here: Demand in Europe is collapsing due to coronavirus, so Chinese loadings are largely offsetting some of this. At the same time, Russia's economy is expected to contract by 1% this year, based on forecasting from BOFIT, the Bank of Finland Institute for Economies in Transition, as reported by BNE Intellinews. That compares to earlier forecasts of 1.9% growth for the Russian economy. Weathering the self-inflicted oil price war in combination with the drop in global demand brought about by COVID-19 may be more than Russia can handle.According to Norway's Rystad Energy, it's going to get much worse. As reported by Reuters, Rystad said on Wednesday that the coronavirus pandemic could force global oil demand to fall by 4.9 million barrels per day in 2020, representing a nearly 5% drop. That's a significant number because only last week Rystad had put the drop at 2.8 million bpd for this year. Forecasts are now changing as swiftly as the virus is spreading, and April will likely be a month of major mourning for the industry as the consultancy predicts a 16-million-bpd drop in demand compared to the same month last year. For Russia, the numbers look disastrous, but for China, where the virus originated, it's an opportunity to stockpile on the cheap. By Editorial DepartmentMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

The company noted it will direct most of its capital expenditure plans to locations outside its home market, pointing out that 80 percent of its free cash flow was generated outside the United States.Halliburton will also spend less this year. Reuters reported, citing its chief financial officer, that the spending reduction would be significant although he did not give an exact number. In some parts of its business, the company is eyeing cuts of up to 60-65 percent. Halliburton originally planned to spend $1.2 billion this year.\"The industry is facing an unprecedented dual impact on demand and supply side that none of us have witnessed over our professional lifetimes,\" CFO Lance Loeffler told shareholders, as quoted by Reuters.Earlier this month Halliburton said it would furlough 3,500 employees for two months. The 3,500 employees will work alternating weekly schedules - one on, one off - during the period. They will only be paid for the weeks worked, Halliburton said.\"We believe moving to this schedule will allow us to best manage costs and provide full benefits to our employees during this difficult market,\" a spokeswoman for the oilfield services major said in a statement.Halliburton, Reuters notes, is the largest provider of hydraulic fracturing services in the U.S. shale patch. Despite its size, it is already feeling the pain from the oil price rout, with its share price tanking by 70 percent over the last four weeks to just above $6 apiece.More pain is to come: at least one U.S. shale producer, Parsley Energy, has asked oilfield service providers to cut their prices by as much as 25 percent to help E&Ps weather the new crisis.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "The slow and painful death of the coal industry is creating some interesting new opportunities for green energy solutions, with industrious capitalists turning ex-coal-fired power plants into renewable energy hubs, data centers and more. Coal is still the largest source of electricity on the planet, mainly because it is abundant and cheap. It's also one of the largest sources of global greenhouse gas emissions. And as the climate change crisis grows more dire by the day, investors are looking ahead, focusing on greener investments themselves, or leveraging their stakes in fossil fuel giants to push for greater diversification away from oil, coal and gas. Not only are investors turning their backs on coal, but renewable energy sources such as solar and wind are also quickly becoming more competitive. In fact, in Europe, the United States and China, renewables are now cheaper than coal - by a lot. And now, the industry is facing another challenge: COVID-19. Durand D'souza, a data scientist at Carbon Tracker, explains, \"Coal power plants, which are already under economic stress across the world, will subsequently have reduced utilization rates and therefore will become even less economically viable.\"Related: This Supermajor Is About To Slash Permian Oil ProductionIt's a perfect storm for coal, and it is forcing more and more coal-fired plants to close their doors. Breathing Life Into Shuttered Coal Plants For the past century, coal-fired power plants have played a major role in the world's electricity market. They are completely intertwined with the U.S. power grid, in particular, meaning that decoupling the plants from the grids could be costly and time-consuming. That's why some ambitious industrialists are stepping in to make the most out of a bad situation. Companies and organizations throughout the United States are creating new systems to redevelop abandoned fossil-fueled plants. In Chicago, for example, developers are planning to build a massive data center at the old Fisk Generating coal-fired power plant. The shuttered plant is part of a larger initiative focusing on a coal-free Chicago, and presents a unique opportunity to push the city into a greener tomorrow. And in nearby Independence, Missouri, the city's utilities arm received a pair of proposals for the possibility of repurposing its shuttered Blue Valley Power Plant. One of the offers proposes the installation of 50 MW of battery storage. The other envisions manufacturing biofuel at the site.By Michael Kern for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

For now, we can talk of about one trillion rubles a month,\" Alexey Repik, chairman of Business Russia, told the news agency in an interview.He added, however, that Russia's debt load is much smaller than that of other economies, so recovery should be relatively smooth.Russia's debt to GDP ration is indeed among the lowest in the world, at 19.48 percent, according to data from the International Monetary Fund. In comparison, China's debt to GDP level is 54.44 percent, and Japan's is the highest in the world, at 234.18 percent of GDP.Following the oil price crash from earlier this month, Russia's Finance Ministry said Moscow had enough resources to cover budget shortfalls amid oil prices that are between $25 and $30 a barrel for six to ten years. The Russian budget, according to the ministry, was balanced at a price for the Urals blend of $42.40 a barrel. Still, the country's sovereign wealth fund had, as of March 1, assets worth over $100 billion, equal to 7.3 percent of GDP and enough to compensate for lower oil revenues due to the drop in oil prices, the finance ministry said.Last week, Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said Russia's revenues from oil and gas would be US$39.5 billion (3 trillion rubles) lower than planned due to the tumbling oil prices. Admitting that the economy was not doing as well as it could be, Siluanov said the oil price fall alone would cost the Russian economy $39.5 billion this year.At current oil prices, the Russian economy will tip into a deficit, although a moderate one, at 0.9 percent, Siluanov said separately.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Tunisia has started production at the long-awaited Nawara gas field, a development that is expected to transform the country's energy balance and provide a significant boon to state finances.Production began at the field, located in the southern governorate of Tataouine, in early February. The launch was the culmination of a decade-long process: the reserves were first discovered in 2006 and preparation work started in 2008.The TD3.5bn ($1.2bn) development, the country's largest energy project, is expected to boost gas production by 2.7m cu metres per day, increasing national gas output by 50%. It is also expected to produce 7000 barrels of oil and 3200 barrels of liquefied petroleum gas every day.Speaking at the inauguration, then Prime Minister Youssef Chahed said the gas field would augment GDP growth by 1 percentage point, while cutting the energy and trade deficits by 20% and 7%, respectively.This would have a significant impact on national finances. The trade deficit reached a record high of TD19.4bn ($6.8bn) last year, according to official statistics, with the energy deficit making up around one-third of the shortfall.In addition to addressing domestic energy needs and reducing imports, the discovery will open up the possibility of exporting surplus gas through the Trans-Mediterranean pipeline, which links the country to Europe.While the launch of production at Nawara is an important development for the sector, Tunisia is also looking to diversify its energy mix through renewables and energy efficiency policies in order to secure long-term self-sufficiency.At present, natural gas still dominates, accounting for around 97% of power generation.While Nawara will make a big difference, the country is still projected to depend on imports to meet around 55% of demand this year, according to forecasts from oil and gas analysts MEES.Related: The Boldest Permian Plays To Watch As The Oil Market Circles The DrainTo help bridge this gap and secure a more stable energy mix moving forward, the authorities have been looking at the country's long-recognised renewables potential, as well as promoting energy efficiency measures such as combined heat and power (CHP), also known as cogeneration, systems.\"As the price of renewable energies drops year-on-year, the solution to the energy question can clearly be found in cogeneration units and renewables,\" Sahbi Amara, Africa director at Clarke Energy, told OBG.CHP development in Tunisia was launched in 2001. At the end of 2019 the total running capacity exceeded 100 MW, with around 200 MW to be installed across various industries. This will allow for a more than 30% savings in natural gas and a 40% reduction in CO2 emissions.In late 2016 the government released its Renewable Energy Action Plan 2030, which outlines plans to generate one-third of electricity from renewables by 2030, up from around 5% at the end of 2018.The ambitious plan is divided into two phases: the first, covering 2016-20, aims to add 1000 MW of renewable generation capacity and reduce energy consumption by 17%; the second, covering 2021-30, should see an additional 1250 MW of new renewable capacity come on-line.To this end, in mid-2018 the government announced tenders for six solar photovoltaic power plants with a combined capacity of 500 MW.These included a tender for a 120-MW photovoltaic power plant in the Gafsa governorate, awarded in January this year to French utilities supplier Engie and Morocco-based Nareva. Also in January, China's TBEA Xinjiang New Energy and the UAE's Amea Power were awarded the contract for a 100-MW solar power plant in the Kairouan governorate.While these projects will undeniably provide Tunisia with much-needed power supply, maintaining a mix of sources will likely remain a priority.\"The use of different types of gas offers vast opportunities for new projects. Using landfill gases to generate electricity and heat by trapping biomethane, for example, is an energy creation process already employed in several markets around the world. The key advantage of using these gases for energy is that they are constantly released as landfills are continuously replenished,\" Amara told OBG.By Oxford Business Group More Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "One of Canada's biggest oil companies has been forced by low oil prices to partially shut down production at its Fort Hills oil sands project, the company said in an update, adding that it would reduce its capital spending plans for the year by 26 percent.  \"Fort Hills continues to be disproportionately impacted by mandatory production curtailment with the asset operating at lower than optimal facility utilization,\" Suncor said. \"The Fort Hills partners have agreed to reduce Fort Hills to a one train operation, running at full utilization. This will increase cash flow, particularly when bitumen prices are extremely low, as we are able to significantly reduce variable costs.\" Western Canadian Select, the local benchmark for heavy crude, has slumped below $10 a barrel, at one point last week trading as low as $6 a barrel. On Tuesday, the benchmark closed at $7.96 a barrel. For the full year, Suncor expects to produce 740,000 to 780,000 bpd of oil in total. Oil sands production is seen at 410,000-435,000 bpd, with synthetic oil output at 310,000-325,000 bpd. Suncor expects bitumen production to average between 100,000 and 110,000 bpd. \"The simultaneous supply and demand shocks are having a significant impact on the global oil industry. We are adjusting our spending and operational plans to be prepared in the event the current business environment persists for an extended period of time,\" Suncor's chief executive said, with the press release referring to the current challenges the industry is facing as \"unprecedented\". The country's oil industry is already vulnerable to international price shocks due to pipeline capacity that has, in the past, caused WCS to slump compared to WTI. According to media reports from earlier this month, the federal government was preparing a multibillion-dollar financial aid package to avoid a more profound industry crisis.

Oxy agreed to pay $55 billion in cash for Anadarko, which saddled it with total debt of $39 billion. Its shares have shed 75 percent since the start of the price war, and Moody's last week downgraded its bonds to junk status.Oxy planned to sell $15 billion worth of assets to pay down the debt, but these plans have run into delays and obstacles, and now, with the oil price crash, offloading them might prove an arduous task.\"During this unprecedented time impacting our industry, and the global economy, we're taking aggressive actions to ensure the health of the company while protecting jobs,\" spokeswoman Melissa Schoeb said in a statement quoted by Reuters.\"We notified our employees of a number of measures we will be implementing, including compensation reductions, which will impact everyone at the company starting with the management team,\" Schoeb also said.The salary cut will concern employees who earn more than $76,000 a year.Earlier this month, in response to the price funk, Occidental cut its spending plans by $1.9 billion and scaled back dividends, expecting to save some $4.1 billion to $4.3 billion annually, Reuters reported. Occidental is far from the only one cutting expenses. Across the U.S. oil industry, companies have already announced spending cuts that average 30 percent, according to Reuters data, and many expect curtailed production.

        "content": "A private Mexican company will buy 15 million barrels of Venezuelan oil under an oil-for-food deal struck with the government in Caracas, the firm, Libre Abordo, told Reuters.Earlier this month, Reuters cited documents that revealed the Mexican company had already received 6.2 million barrels of Venezuelan crude that it would resell on international markets and had scheduled two more cargos of oil and fuel for delivery by the end of the month.In exchange, Libre Abordo supplied corn and water to Venezuela, the earlier report said, quoting the Mexican company, which also said the deal, signed last year, was not in violation of U.S. sanctions because it involved no cash payments.Documentation from Venezuela's PdVSA shows that since the deal was signed late last year, Libre Abordo and another related company, Schlager Business Group, had bought some 14.3 million barrels of Venezuelan oil and fuels.\"We will reach some 15 million barrels - it is not an exact figure - through the first contract signed with Petroleos de Venezuela,\" the company told Reuters.Venezuela has been grappling with hyperinflation and shortages of basic products as a result of the U.S. sanctions levied on the Maduro government, which Washington has declared illegitimate. Oil is the country's biggest export commodity, and U.S. sanctions have crippled this revenue stream, forcing the government to seek other ways to bring in food and, apparently, water.There are also severe fuel shortages across the country, and the government has reportedly begun shutting down refineries. According to an unnamed source who spoke to Bloomberg, the government will leave only a few stations open to be managed by the army. These, however, will only service medical, food transport, and utility vehicles. Meanwhile, Washington is preparing more sanctions for the Venezuelan government, which is now dealing with the coronavirus on top of an existing humanitarian crisis, with 70 cases reported as of Monday.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "title": "Can The U.S. Convince Saudi Arabia To End The Oil War?",
        "content": "US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo is applying verbal pressure to Saudi Arabia, encouraging the Middle Eastern country who started the oil price war to \"rise to the occasion\" and reassure the oil markets, the State Department has said, according to the Arab News.Pompeo spoke to Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MbS) before a G20 conference call, urging at least action through words, at a time when oil prices are particularly vulnerable--not just because of the oil price war, but also because of the depressed demand stemming from the coronavirus.But the words seem laughable, given that the low oil prices are precisely what Saudi Arabia is hoping to achieve.Saudi Arabia has, for years, been doing the lion's share of the production cutting that OPEC agreed on to hold up oil prices, at great cost to its own finances. Meanwhile, other OPEC nations such as Iraq, have done precious little to toe the OPEC line, and Saudi Arabia has had to cut more to offset the noncompliant members. Russia, too, has failed to live up to its part of the production cuts.When the OPEC+ deal fell apart a couple of weeks ago, it was Russia's reluctance to cut more and for longer--as if they had restricted production to any great extent in the first place, overproducing nearly--if not every--month throughout the deal. Its rationale for refusing to cut and to cut more are not without merit. First, Russia's oilfields cannot be turned on and off as easily as others, such as US shale. Second, cutting back production to manipulate the prices only works if the world's largest producer--the United States--were to play along too. And it's not. Cutting back production further, Russia contends, opens the door for US shale to take even more market share.Related: Cesium - The Most Important Metal You've Never Heard OfThe refusal was the last straw for Saudi Arabia, and it responded by playing hardball, threatening to increase its production as of April 1, when the current OPEC production agreement is set to end. Saudi Arabia is likely hoping that the low oil prices will be Russia back to the table. Russia, likewise, is hoping Saudi Arabia won't have the staying power to hold the line at $20-something oil.For now, this is precisely the situation Saudi Arabia was hoping for--pain for other oil producers to bring about a change in action. Saudi Arabia, however, probably didn't expect the prices to drop off quite so quickly, helped by the devastating effects of the global COVID-19 pandemic.Without some incentive, and there may be one that the United States is offering, MbS has little reason to undo the damage it has intentionally inflicted in the oil markets.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "title": "China's Coal Rush Causes Global Capacity To Rise For The First Time Since 2015",
        "content": "The world's net capacity additions of coal-fired power generation rose in 2019 for the first time since 2015, due to a surge in the Chinese coal fleet, a new report from environmental organizations shows.Worldwide, a total of 68.3 gigawatts (GW) of new coal power were commissioned last year, with 34.2 GW retired. This shift resulted in a net increase in the global coal fleet of 34.1 GW, according to findings from Global Energy Monitor (GEM), Sierra Club, Greenpeace International, and the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA).   This was the first such increase since 2015, as commissioning increased from 2018 levels and retirements flattened, the report says.As much as 64 percent of the newly-commissioned coal capacity was in China, another 12 percent came from India, and the remaining 24 percent was mainly in Asian countries, including Malaysia, Indonesia, and Pakistan.Almost half of the retired coal power capacity in 2019 was in the United States, the second-highest on record, the report showed.  \"Under Trump, US coal plant retirements have increased 67% compared to Obama. Retirements averaged 8.2 GW a year during Obama's tenure (2009-2016), and 13.7 GW a year during Trump's tenure (2017-2019),\" the authors of the report wrote.Related: Building The Sustainable City Of The FutureDespite the increase in global coal capacity in 2019, the amount of power generated globally from coal fell by 3 percent year-on-year, with global coal plants operating at an average 51 percent of their available operating hours, a record low, according to the report.    \"Though coal is still advancing in some Asian countries, the rest of the world is clearly seeing an overall decline in the coal fleet. This is an international trend that is only going to continue,\" Gyorgy Dallos, Global Strategist for Greenpeace International, said, commenting on the report.  A study from Global Energy Monitor showed in November 2019 that between January 2018 and June 2019, the world minus China saw their total coal power capacity decline by 8.1 GW. At the same time, China increased its coal-fired power plant fleet by 42.9 GW, resulting in the global coal fleet growing by 34.9 GW between January 2018 and June 2019.

        "title": "Russia's Self-Inflicted Oil Crisis",
        "content": "The timing could not have been worse for Russia to provoke a spat with Saudi Arabia over oil production quotas in early March. Moscow's decision to withdraw from the OPEC+ agreement restricting oil production in order to maintain higher oil prices triggered a harsh reaction by Riyadh that sent oil prices spiraling down to below $25 per barrel in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic (Oilprice.com, March 24). The price of Russian Urals oil dipped even lower, under $19 on March 18, which will deprive the Russian budget of some $3 billion a month (Vedomosti, March 19).The Russian economy is likely to suffer the most devastating consequences of the oil price war - just as it bore the heaviest impact of low global oil prices five years ago. This time around, however, the injury is self-inflicted, as an angry Saudi Arabia not only decided to ramp up production but also moved to grab Russia's oil market share around the world (see EDM, March 19, 23).On March 6, Russia's Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak declined to accept new oil production quotas after April 1 when the current OPEC+ deal expires (Oilcapital.ru, March 10). The move targeted primarily debt-burdened U.S. shale oil companies, which were already under pressure by the advancing COVID-19 pandemic. Moscow has long resented that the U.S. oil sector has continued growing unobstructed by cartel policies and has steadily overtaken Russia and Saudi Arabia as the world's leading oil producer. Russian energy officials took advantage of the coronavirus spread globally to deal a blow to indebted American shale oil producers who need an oil price above $40 a barrel to remain solvent (Asia Times, March 18).But Moscow also needs an oil price above $40 to balance its budget (Lenta.ru, March 11), for which oil and natural gas revenues make up to 40 percent. The current budget is calculated at an oil price of $42 per barrel (Interfax, March 1), and that, combined with foreign currency reserves of $570 billion, could indeed provide a cushion - but only in the short term. A sizeable foreign currency reserve helped prop up Russia's budget when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) drove oil prices down in 2014, targeting oil companies in the United States. The drop in oil prices then overlapped with the Western-imposed sanctions against Russia for invading Ukraine. The budget, calculated at an oil price of $96 per barrel at the time, had to be revised when oil prices dropped to $45 and revenues decreased by $160 billion, one third of Russian overall exports (Cbr.ru, May 2015, accessed March 25, 2020). Social spending programs had to be put on hold until oil prices recovered a few years later, resulting in increased social protests in 2018 and 2019 (Kommersant, June 22, 2019).Today, Russia is in a much riskier situation as its long-term financial stability is threatened if oil prices do not recover. The Kremlin evidently did not expect that its disagreement with Saudi Arabia would lead to a plunge below $20 per barrel. Officials are now playing down the long-term impact on the economy. Russia's Finance Minister Anton Siluanov has said he is not concerned about the fall in oil prices, because Russian oil companies have recently accumulated a large safety cushion (RBC, March 20).If a price agreement is not reached soon, however, Russia's prospects would be grimmer than in 2014-2015, because oil prices are 50 percent lower, Western sanctions remain in effect and new ones were introduced, and global oil demand has shrunk due to the coronavirus pandemic. In addition, Saudi Arabia has been successful in snatching some of Russia's markets, including an oil purchase deal with Azerbaijan's State-Owned Oil Company (SOCAR) (Ona.az, March 13). Not surprisingly, Moscow quickly settled price negotiations with Minsk and agreed to sell crude oil to Belarus at a significant discount of $15.70 per ton (Tut.by, March 23; see EDM, March 24).Related: Saudi Arabia And The U.S. Could Form The World's Newest Oil CartelIn the meantime, Russian oil companies have started revising their investment plans due to the collapse of oil prices. Lukoil was the first to admit it will have to cut investment by $1.5 billion, mainly for new projects. Its vice president, Leonid Fedun, said that with oil prices below $35 per barrel, oil production in Russia will begin to decline from 2022-2023 (Kommersant, March 20).It is becoming increasingly clear that if oil prices do not recover, President Vladimir Putin is unlikely to deliver on his promise to increase social spending. The plan, announced in Putin's annual State of the Nation address on January 15, includes 4.1 trillion rubles ($65 billion at the time of the address) in social spending by 2024 to assist the poor, increase pensions, help families and boost the national birth rate (Kremlin, January 15).The period of economic hardship coincides with President Putin's attempt to secure his position as de facto president for life, after he initiated changes to the Russian constitution (see EDM, January 16, March 16, 19). The authorities scheduled a nationwide constitutional plebiscite on the amendments for April 22, but this was subsequently delayed amid the coronavirus pandemic (Meduza, March 25). The COVID-19 outbreak in Russia and several weeks of inept or counterproductive government response - the authorities have been habitually hiding the facts and arresting activists who report on coronavirus cases - are making Russian citizens even more anxious. Putin suspended work for all non-essential laborers from March 28 to April 5 in an effort to curb the infection (Meduza, March 25). The pandemic will undoubtedly take an additional financial and social toll in a time of decreased oil revenues.By Margarita Assenova via Jamestown FoundationMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

The Kingdom is intent on unleashing growing crude oil volumes on the global market, aiming to significantly boost its crude oil exports to a record-breaking more than 10 million bpd in May.In Europe, Saudi Arabia appears to be going after Russia's oil market share with deeply discounted Arab Light crude at up to three times the usual volumes. Saudi Arabia hasn't seen Europe as a core market in recent years because it has prioritized continuously growing demand in Asian markets. But in the war of market share, the Kingdom is now looking to squeeze Russian oil out of Europe by offering deep discounts which make its Arab Light crude priced at as low as $25 a barrel at Rotterdam, much lower than the price of Urals.Regardless of the cheap extra Saudi crude oil, refiners in Europe plan to cut allocations for Saudi oil by as much as 25 percent for April, Reuters sources said, as many major economies - including Germany, France, Spain, Italy, and the UK - are in lockdown mode to try to slow the spread of the coronavirus.

The company owns and operates 186 auto dealerships along with 242 franchises and 49 collision centers, mostly in the U.S. and U.K.And on Wednesday, the company provided a business update: the outlook for the industry was catastrophic, to say the least.As a result of the coronavirus lockdown and beginning on March 6, the company said that overall U.S. vehicle sales volumes began to significantly decrease, and are currently down 50-70 percent from normal expected March volumes. Additionally, the company said that based on discussions with its OEM partners, this sales decline is consistent with that experienced by other dealers.\"Virtually all of Group 1's U.S. dealerships are located in markets operating in some type of 'shelter in place' or restricted travel environments in accordance with applicable state and local orders,\" the company said in its release. The company also said it was seeing a similar pattern in the U.K., where it was having a good March prior to the coronavirus lockdown. \"Order take in recent weeks declined by approximately 50 percent,\" the release said. And like many other companies, they are being forced to take drastic steps to try and shore up their business during this difficult time. Among other things, the company has been forced to furlough 3,000 U.S. operating and staff employees for a 30-day period with an option for a second 30-day period and furlough 2,800 U.K. employees for an initial period of 21 days, which equates to about 90 percent of the Company's U.K. workforce.Additionally, they are implementing reduction of corporate compensation, including reductions in salary of 50%, 35%, 20% and 15% for the company's CEO, President, SVPs and Corporate Vice Presidents, respectively.Related: Saudi Arabia's Oil Price War Is BackfiringEarl J.

This is requiring us to take many severe and regrettable actions to re-size our business to minimal activity levels in the near term.  I believe that the swift and decisive actions that we are taking will enable us to recover quickly when the market recovers as it undoubtedly will.\"If Group 1 acts as an accurate barometer, which we believe it will, we not only expect carnage in the auto industry for March, but also for the economy in general as macro numbers begin to trickle in.

Oil production in the Latin American country has slumped over the past three years due to the dire economic situation and the increasing U.S. sanctions on its exports and companies selling Venezuela's oil. Earlier this year, Venezuela managed to achieve a slight increase in its crude oil output, only for the coronavirus pandemic to spread and cause significant demand destruction worldwide, putting more pressure on Nicolas Maduro's regime. Venezuela's crude oil production plunged to 464,000 barrels per day (bpd) last week, sources with access to production data told Bloomberg. Last week's production dropped by 38 percent from the average output in February. According to Bloomberg's sources, production at Chevron's joint venture with PdVSA more than halved to around 50,000 bpd last week from 120,000 bpd in January. Petromonagas, a joint venture of PdVSA and Russia's oil giant Rosneft, saw its production last week at 20,000 bpd, just a quarter of what was in January. At the same time, inventories in Venezuela are piling up, at some 30.9 million barrels, but no one to buy them.    Of the oil Venezuela manages to load on tankers for exports, health inspections on tankers caused a delay to least two cargoes as Venezuela attempts to prevent the spreading of COVID-19, Reuters reported earlier this week, citing an internal document of state oil firm PdVSA that it has seen. Venezuela's battered economy and oil industry now face the triple threat from low oil prices, plunging global demand, and the spread of the coronavirus.

        "content": "Demand for gasoline in the United States fell by 859,000 bpd, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said in its weekly petroleum status report. According to Reuters, this is the sharpest demand decline since last September.Total fuel demand also declined, almost 2.1 million bpd last week, as lockdowns begin to weigh on consumption.Earlier this month, Reuters reported gasoline pumps are sitting idle as people cancel their travel plans amid the worsening coronavirus outbreak that has so far infected more than 68,500 Americans and killed more than 1,000.The situation is unusual. Gasoline is getting cheaper because of tanking crude oil prices, but drivers in the most car-loving country in the world cannot take advantage of these lower prices because they have to self-isolate at home. The United States consumes about 20 million bpd of oil and products, with gasoline consumption at 9 million bpd.The worst is yet to come, according to analysts, as expectations are the number infected with Covid-19 will continue to rise for a while, possibly forcing an extension of the social distancing measures that prompted the drop in gasoline consumption.\"We would estimate commuting and leisure driving will be down up to 50%, with most impact in the northern states where the virus spreads faster now,\" a partner in Rystad Energy told Reuters.Related: World's Largest Oil Trader Says Demand Could Plummet By 20 Million BpdThe global situation for demand is not much better. Vitol's chief executive Russell Hardy told Bloomberg earlier this week that the coronavirus pandemic could, at its peak, wipe out as much as 15 to 20 million bpd in global oil demand.\"It's pretty huge in terms of anything we've had to deal with before,\" Vitol's chief executive said.Global oil storage is filling up fast in this context, Reuters reported earlier this week, despite rising costs of storage,--in some cases by as much as 100 percent.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Fiscal buffers and improved policy response will not materially weaken Russia's credit profile at a time of low oil prices, Moody's said in a new report, although it cut its estimate for Russia's economic growth this year on the back of the slumping oil prices and the coronavirus-driven economic slowdown.Moody's revised down on Wednesday its outlook for Russia's gross domestic product (GDP) growth to 0.5 percent this year, down from 1.5 percent growth expected earlier, due to the low price of oil, weakening demand outside Russia, and lower purchasing power of the Russian households.Earlier this week, Moody's said that Russia would be among the least hit oil-exporting nations in the price collapse, with fiscal revenues and exports expected to drop this year by less than 3 percent of 2019 GDP. To compare, the worst-hit oil nations - Iraq and Kuwait - could see those fiscal revenues and exports drop in 2020 by more than 10 percent of GDP this year. For Saudi Arabia, the drop could be between 4 percent and 8 percent of GDP, according to Moody's.  \"The sovereigns most vulnerable to lower oil prices in 2020-21 are those with the highest reliance on hydrocarbons as a source of fiscal revenue and exports, and limited capacity to adjust,\" said Alexander Perjessy, a Moody's Vice President - Senior Analyst.  Related: China's Emissions Are Plunging, But It Might Not LastThe most vulnerable oil producers are Oman, Bahrain, Iraq, and Angola, while \"stronger fiscal positions ahead of the shock buffer the credit implications for Qatar, Russia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Saudi Arabia,\" Moody's said.Last week, Moscow admitted that its revenues from oil and gas would be US$39.5 billion (3 trillion rubles) lower than planned due to the tumbling oil prices and that Russia's budget would be in deficit this year. Russia has sufficient buffers to cope with the situation, Kremlin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said last week, reiterating the official Russian position that it can live with oil prices so low for up to ten years.

        "content": " Woodfibre LNG, a small-scale project in British Columbia, will be delayed by a year amid the Covid-19 crisis, which has prompted the shutdown of a contractor that Woodfibre LNG worked with for the supply of components, CBC News reports, citing a company spokeswoman. The shutdown of the component supplier--a Chinese company--was aggravated by the fact that Woodfibre LNG's preferred contractor for the construction of the underwater part of the project had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. As a result of this unfortunate combination of events, Woodfibre LNG will file for a five-year extension to its environmental certificate, which, CBC reports, will expire this October. While Wooddibre LNG is a small project, with an annual export capacity of 2.1 million tons of liquefied gas, a much bigger project, Canada LNG, has also run into difficulties. The company said earlier this month it had laid off 750 workers to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The facility, which is on track to become operational before 2025, will initially have two liquefaction \"trains\", each with a capacity of 6.5 million tons of LNG. The project could also add another two trains at a later stage, bringing the total capacity of the facility in Kitimat, in northern British Columbia, to as much as 26 million tons annually. Construction of the LNG Canada trains has not stopped. The outlook for the LNG industry has been gloomy for the short term but somewhat optimistic for the medium to long term. This week the short-term outlook grew gloomier after India, one of the world's top importers of LNG, imposed a national lockdown on its population of 1.3 billion to stem the spread of Covid-19. As a result, all nonessential businesses are closing, and the demand for LNG has fallen off a cliff. Yesterday, Indian LNG importers declared a force majeure on deliveries, according to industry sources who spoke to Reuters. By Irina Slav for Oilprice.com More Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Indian liquefied natural gas importers have declared force majeure on imports as a nationwide lockdown on the 1.3 billion-strong nation has slashed consumption of the fuel, Reuters reported, citing an unnamed source familiar with the situation. India is among the largest importers of liquefied natural gas, as is China, where importers issued a force majeure on imports earlier this year, in the peak of the coronavirus outbreak. This force majeure will immediately place additional pressure on already depressed gas prices, suffering the combination of excessive supply and subdued demand, pretty much like crude oil, except for the price war. \"India had been the saving grace for the spot LNG market over the past month, buying the fuel when it was cheap,\" Reuters quoted an S&P Global Platts analyst as saying. Ira Joseph, head of global gas and power analytics, referred to India as \"the most aggressive, price-sensitive buyer out of the market.\" Indeed, low gas prices were a bounty for mega importers, just as low oil prices prompted China and India to fill up their storage facilities. However, the demand collapse has put an end to that, and LNG prices, which in late January fell to the lowest in a decade, continued down, after a brief respite driven by increased buying from India. \"Only fertiliser, power and refineries are running at parcel loads. Other local buyers have already issued force majeure so where should we sell LNG?\" Reuters' source said. Another source, a prominent Indian LNG importer, told Reuters that most of its clients have shut down because of the lockdown as their business does not qualify as essential commodities. These developments, as expected, will cast a shadow on the future of LNG production projects at the planning stage, already uncertain because of the glut-driven gas price slump. The Indian lockdown will be in effect for 21 days. By Irina Slav for Oilprice.com More Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Global oil demand could fall by about 20 million barrels per day, EIA's Executive Director, Fatih Birol said in a Thursday press briefing, according to Bloomberg.As 3 billion people in the world remain confined to their homes except to leave to get necessities, activity around the globe is falling--and oil demand along with it. Exacerbating the issue, Birol said, was the oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia.Oil prices, which saw a brief bump on Wednesday after it became clear that the Senate would pass its $2 trillion stimulus bill that largely neglected the industry, were trading down in the afternoon. The stimulus package, while impressive, was unable to keep oil prices up in the wake of such a bleak demand outlook.  WTI was trading just a hair above $23 per barrel, down 5.76% on the day. Brent crude was trading at $29.05, down 3.13% on the day.Both benchmarks were down a couple of dollars per barrel from this point last week, and down nearly 50% month on month.Oil prices have been under even more added pressure on the supply side, with Saudi Arabia and Russia moving to ramp up oil production in a mad dash to regain market share.The oil demand revisions from various banks and analysts are coming on an almost daily basis, with each one worse than the previous.Also this week, Goldman Sachs predicted that oil demand would sink by 18.7 million bpd in April, compared to Sachs' estimation that March will see a drop off in demand of 10.5 million bpd. Goldman's prediction came with another sour note: this steep demand drop-off would \"overwhelm any supply response\" by OPEC, such as further production cuts--indicating that it might be too late for suppliers to take any coordinated action.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

The U.S. has signaled it is ready to continue to tighten the noose around the Venezuelan government. Separately, Rosneft announced a surprise move: it will be pulling out of Venezuela, selling its assets there to a state-owned Russian company. \"Today Rosneft concluded an agreement with the company 100% owned by the Government of Russian Federation, to sell all of its interest and cease participation in its Venezuelan businesses, including joint ventures of Petromonagas, Petroperija, Boqueron, Petromiranda and Petrovictoria, as well as oil-field services companies, commercial and trading operations,\" the state giant said in a press release on Saturday.The move appears to serve a way to shield Rosneft from U.S. punitive actions related to the enforcement of sanctions, and according to the Venezuelan president, a sign of the continued support for his government on the part of Moscow.Right now, Russia is not the only voice in support of Venezuela. The coronavirus has hit hard the South American country, and there have been calls from politicians in the United States and abroad for Washington to ease the sanctions.\"It's absolutely unconscionable to keep sanctions on at this moment,\" the AP quoted Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University, as saying.\"The only moral, sane and legal thing to do is stop the madness that is crippling other countries' health systems.\"By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

Vitol--whose 2019 revenues clocked in at $225 billion---and other unnamed traders hope to capitalize on the lower oil prices by producing or buying the oil now, storing it, and selling that oil later when oil prices rebound.The tankers have been booked for at least three months.Vitol predicted on Thursday in a Bloomberg TV interview that the world will see an oil demand loss of anywhere from 15 million bpd to 20 million bpd over the next few weeks due to the coronavirus pandemic as oil storage fills up.And there aren't many VLCCs up for grabs to store oil on either for March and April, Rystad pointed out last week, after Saudi Arabia moved quickly to book VLCCs to bring all its extra oil to market as promised. At the time, Rystad estimated that just 1.7 billion barrels of storage was available onshore for crude and crude products--and this will be maxed out in a few months.With VLCCs in short supply, Supertanker prices have risen roughly 678%, Forbes reported earlier this month, with lease rates increasing on an almost daily basis.

        "content": "Caught in the Saudi-Russian oil price war, Africa's largest oil producer, Nigeria, has discounted deeply its crude and aims to pump as much as it can, trying to retain customers in the unprecedented demand plunge.However, the price to pay in the oil price war may be too steep for Nigeria.   Right now, Nigeria's only response is to discount its oil and to pump oil at maximum levels possible, the country's petroleum, minister Timipre Sylva, told Bloomberg in an interview.   Africa's largest producer also calls for Saudi Arabia and Russia to end the price war and welcomes U.S. appeals on OPEC's leader Saudi Arabia to rethink its strategy of flooding the market with oil starting next week.Earlier this month, Nigeria discounted its primary crude grades Qua Iboe and Bonny Light and will be selling them in April at a $3 per barrel discount to Dated Brent. Even at the steepest discount in decades, Nigeria may be unable to sell all its April cargoes, traders told Bloomberg this week, as oil demand plunges and other oil producers are also heavily discounting their crude.Nigeria's position in the oil price war is not very strong as most of its export earnings rely on crude oil sales.Related: Not Even The $2 Trillion Stimulus Package Can Save Oil MarketsAccording to Fitch Ratings, Nigeria's breakeven oil price - the oil price required to balance the government's budget, all else being equal - is $144 a barrel, the highest among major oil producers in the Middle East and Africa, including Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, Kuwait, Abu Dhabi, and Qatar.  The demand destruction and the low oil prices will hit many African oil producers, with Nigeria leading the pack with estimated revenue losses of US$15.4 billion at $30 oil this year, estimates from the Atlantic Council's Africa Center showed this week.  Oil accounts for just 10 percent of Nigeria's gross domestic product (GDP), but it is responsible for 57 percent of government budget revenues.\"Oil also accounts for 94 percent of exports and a similar percent of foreignexchange earnings. Thus, government coffers will be hit harder than GDP, and as a result, public services in oil producers will be constrained, just as these countries scramble to shore up their health and education sectors in response to the virus,\" Luke Tyburski, project assistant with the Atlantic Council's Africa Center, wrote.

The ten defendants rented in October a private property in northern Egypt, through which a petroleum pipeline passed, to dig underground and place smaller pipes to steal fuel from the pipeline.In the middle of November 2019, the would-be petroleum thieves accidentally ruptured the pipeline while trying to steal gasoline, causing a leak and a fire that killed nine people and injured more than a dozen others. A hospital in the area of the village between Alexandria and Cairo was full of survivors from the fire, and there appeared to be more wounded people treated for injuries than reported, one resident told Reuters at the time.  Egypt's top prosecutor, Hamada al-Sawy, had referred the defendants to a criminal court in the country after the failed fuel thieves confessed to their crime.In recent years, Egypt has been gradually cutting its fuel subsidy program, aiming to let fuel prices reach international levels and stop subsidizing fuels as part of a program for economic reforms backed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in exchange for loans.By the middle of 2019, Egypt had phased out subsidies on most fuels, saving government expenses in the process, but allowing fuel prices for consumers to rise.In July 2019, Egypt decided to create a committee that would set the fuel prices in the country every three months, based on international oil prices. This committee is expected to soon announce the new fuel prices as of April 1, and is considering slashing them by 20-30 percent, due to the low oil prices and the challenges for the economies in the COVID-19 pandemic, local outlet Ahram Online reported this week, citing a source with knowledge of the matter.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

Foreign firms who develop Iraqi oil fields do so under service contracts and are being paid a fixed fee in U.S. dollars for their oil production.Now that Iraq's fellow OPEC member Saudi Arabia signals a wave of extra oil supply to the market and the coronavirus pandemic batters global oil demand, oil prices in the $20s are utterly unsustainable for Iraq's oil revenues and total budget income, much of which depends on income from oil exports.The foreign oil firms have received the letter from Iraq asking for a 30-percent cut in budgets, but they have not made a decision yet, a source with a foreign oil company told Reuters.Foreign oil operators in Iraq are also looking for savings from their suppliers.ExxonMobil, for example, has already asked all its suppliers in Iraq to cut costs, the U.S. supermajor said in a letter to those suppliers seen by Reuters.Iraq, which relies on oil revenues for 95 percent of its budgetary income, is one of the least diversified economies in the Middle East. It will likely have to enforce strict austerity measures after its fellow OPEC member and the cartel's de facto leader, Saudi Arabia, launched an all-out oil price war with Russia.    According to Moody's, Iraq is one of the most vulnerable oil producers in this price crash and could see its fiscal revenues and exports drop in 2020 by more than 10 percent of GDP this year.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

For the first time in years, PetroChina avoided disclosing a firm budget estimate for 2020 in its annual 2019 results release, which showed that its 2019 net profit dropped by 13.9 percent on the year, worse than analyst expectations.Previously, PetroChina had approved 2020 CAPEX of US$41.7 billion (295 billion Chinese yuan), which is now no longer valid.\"Considering the impact of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (\"COVID-19\") and changes in international oil prices, the Group will follow the principle of positive free cash flow, dynamically optimize and adjust the capital expenditures for 2020,\" the Chinese giant said in a statement.PetroChina has created an anti-COVID-19 steering team to work, among other things, on \"reducing expenditure as well as cutting costs and enhancing profitability, controlling the capital expenditures and costs, optimizing debt settlement structure.\"\"The decline in international crude oil prices has adversely affected the Group's sales revenue and profits, the Group actively takes measures to deal with the risks of crude oil price fluctuations, and strives to maintain stable and healthy development of production and operations,\" PetroChina said.The company is also working on a plan to link CAPEX on projects with the price of oil, chief financial officer Chai Shouping said on the teleconference call, as carried by South China Morning Post.PetroChina is not the only Chinese company planning capital budget cuts as oil prices tanked and made many operations, based on $60 oil, unsustainable.Earlier this week, China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) said it would \"significantly\" slash CAPEX and reduce its oil and natural gas production guidance for 2020.

        "content": "As the COVID-19 outbreak continues to weigh on the global economy, the Trump administration has quietly relaxed regulatory measures meant to protect the environment from unnecessary air and water pollution. The Environmental Protection Agency announced a sweeping relaxation of environmental regulations in order to combat the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on businesses. The order enables power plants, manufacturing facilities, and various other facilities to determine whether or not they are meeting the legal requirements on reporting air and water pollution.The struggling oil and gas sector was taking the lead in pushing for the relaxation of regulations during the on-going COVID-19 crisis and an escalating price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia. Issued by the E.P.A.'s top compliance official, Susan P. Bodine, the policy establishes new guidelines for companies to monitor themselves for an undetermined amount of time throughout the coronavirus outbreak. It also claims that the agency will not dole out penalties for violations of any specific pollution reporting requirements.The statement from the E.P.A. reads, \"In general, the E.P.A. does not expect to seek penalties for violations of routine compliance monitoring, integrity testing, sampling, laboratory analysis, training, and reporting or certification obligations in situations where the E.P.A. agrees that Covid-19 was the cause of the noncompliance and the entity provides supporting documentation to the E.P.A. upon request.\"The order urges companies to \"act responsibly\" if they can not currently follow guidelines.  Related: The Reason Why Russia Refused To Cut Oil ProductionFormer Obama-era EPA chief Gina McCarthy, spoke out against the order, suggesting that it was giving companies 'an open license to pollute,\" adding that the order is telling \"companies across the country that they will not face enforcement even if they emit unlawful air and water pollution in violation of environmental laws, so long as they claim that those failures are in some way 'caused' by the virus pandemic. And it allows them an out on monitoring too, so we may never know how bad the violating pollution was.\" While McCarthy was very critical of the order, Granta Nakayama, a partner at the law firm King & Spalding who served in the E.P.A.'s office of compliance under President George W. Bush, believes the order is necessary, stating \"It's a very straightforward and sensible, in my view, guidance.\"By Michael Kern for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "title": "Russia Sees Oil Market Balance In 2021",
        "content": "The global oil market could return to balance in at least one year, all things being equal as-is, Russian Deputy Energy Minister Pavel Sorokin said at a forum in Russia on Friday.  When the first signs of rebalancing appear, we will see a recovery in oil prices, Sorokin said, noting that any timeline on rebalancing would depend on how long major economies remain in lockdown.At $30-35 oil, U.S. oil production could drop by around 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd), the deputy energy minister said.Sorokin discussed at length Russia's reasons not to support deeper cuts at the OPEC+ meeting at the beginning of this month, which led to Saudi Arabia promising a flood of extra oil supply to the market.Russia's position was that the coronavirus outbreak was already hitting oil demand in February and was increasing the uncertainty about how far and how severe the pandemic would spread outside China, Sorokin said, as quoted by Russia's Interfax news agency.Therefore, OPEC's proposal for cuts of between 600,000 bpd to 1.5 million bpd would have been \"a drop in the ocean\" in a market where oil demand is plunging, according to the Russian official. Considering that oil demand is now already down by 15 million bpd, and could reach 20 million bpd in the coming weeks, influencing the market with the cuts proposed by Saudi Arabia-led OPEC would have been impossible, Sorokin said.According to Russia, the 'fair price of oil' currently would be $45-55 a barrel. Such a price range would discourage costly projects and, at the same time, allow demand to grow, Sorokin said.Even if OPEC+ had approved a 1.5-million-bpd cut early this month, the price of oil now would have been up to $7 a barrel higher, the official noted. The coronavirus effect wiped around $25 a barrel from oil prices, he said.As of April 1, when the OPEC+ pact expires, Russian oil firms will look at the economic feasibility when deciding whether to increase production, Sorokin said, and added, in a hint aimed at former partner Saudi Arabia, \"Increased production or sweeping statements, attempts to influence the market were never our goal.\"By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

A reversal of LNG's fortunes seems unlikely, at least in the short term, with stockpiles in Asia also high for this time of the year, discouraging buyers even at current prices.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "U.S. pipeline operators have issued a warning to some oil producers operating in Texas: reduce production rates because storage is filling up, a Texas Railroad Commissioner said in a tweet.\"Got word yesterday that some Texas producers are starting to get letters from shippers (pipelines) asking for oil production cuts because they are out of storage. We need to get in front of this,\" Ryan Sitton wrote on Saturday.Oil prices have continued to decline, with West Texas Intermediate trading at $20.42 a barrel at the time of writing and Brent crude at $26.64 a barrel. Upward potential remains extremely limited as the coronavirus outbreak in the United States has dampened demand for fuels. According to the EIA, demand for gasoline in the second week of March fell by more than 800,000 bpd.Demand for fuels is likely to continue down as the number of diagnosed Covid-19 cases continues up, with the U.S. now leading the world with a total of more than 140,000 cases.Refining margins also crashed, shedding 95 percent on a single day earlier this month, according to a Reuters report. The drop signaled pessimism about the immediate future of fuel demand in tune with expectations about oil demand.\"You're facing a situation where there's so much demand destruction from people staying home because of COVID-19 and there's so much oil flowing right now with no place to go,\" Commissioner Sitton told the Houston Chronicle. \"The supply chain is facing a problem and it backs up all the way to the gas stations.\"The storage problem is not unique to the United States. The whole world is running out of storage space for oil as the biggest buyers of the commodity are unable to take advantage of historically low prices by stocking up, because their demand has been destroyed by lockdowns and travel bans, too, and their tanks are full.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "The Trump administration will later today announce the new fuel economy rules that environmentalists have decried as harmful and compromising the United States' efforts to fight climate change.\"When finalized, the rule will benefit our economy, will improve the U.S. fleet's fuel economy, will make vehicles more affordable, and will save lives by increasing the safety of new vehicles,\" EPA spokeswoman Corry Schiermeier said yesterday, ahead of the announcement, as quoted by the AP. \"This is first time that an administration has pursued a policy that will net negative benefit for society and reduce fuel savings,\" a former EPA official, Chet France, said.The administration proposed the new rules that would effectively roll back Obama-era fuel economy standards for automakers in 2018, recommending the freezing of the mile-per-gallon standards for passenger cars and light trucks after model year 2020.The proposed rulemaking of the U.S. Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the EPA was intended \"to correct the national automobile fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions standards to give the American people greater access to safer, more affordable vehicles that are cleaner for the environment,\" the Department of Transportation said at the time.Since then, the NHTSA has tweaked those rules, so instead of freezing the mile-per-gallon emission standards for six years to 2026, the administration is now proposing an increase to fuel economy by 1.5 percent annually. The Obama-era regulations called for a 5% increase to fuel economy each year.  According to some opponents, the emissions could end up being even worse.\"The SAFE vehicles rule, if finalized in its present form, will lead to vehicles that are neither safer, nor more affordable or fuel efficient,\" Democratic Senator Thomas Carper, from the Senate Environmental and Public Works Committee, said in January.The proposed rules pitted Trump against California, with the state refusing to comply with relaxed emission rules and insisting on enforcing its own, much stricter ones. Several other states also said they would implement their own more stringent emissions rules. The feud drew in carmakers, too, with the majors split between the camps.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Read From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed on Monday to have energy officials from both countries discuss the dire state of the global oil market, the Kremlin said, according to Reuters.Trump and Putin discussed the matter over the phone on Monday.\"Opinions on the current state of the global oil markets were exchanged. It was agreed there would be Russo-American consultations about this through the ministers of energy,\" the Kremlin said.Neither President detailed what specific issues or possibilities they would discuss.Saudi Arabia and Russia have undertaken a furious battle over market share, with both threatening to ramp up production come April 1, when the current OPEC+ deal will expire. U.S. oil producers now find themselves stuck in the middle of this oil price war, and then COVID-19 kicked U.S. producers--and the rest of the world--in the head by pushing down demand for crude.The result has elicited a somewhat atypical response from the United States oil industry and government officials, who favor free markets and never miss a beat to chastise OPEC for its price-meddling ways. But desperation is sinking in, with oil industry professionals and U.S. lawmakers calling on the Trump administration to do something about the current oil price war that OPEC and Russia have created.While the U.S. is planning on sitting down with Russia to discuss the matter, it is also applying pressure to Saudi Arabia to rectify the mess it has helped to create. It would take--at a minimum--both Saudi Arabia and Russia to effect any real change. Even if all of OPEC were to get on board with further production cuts, it is doubtful at this point that even aggressive action will have enough oomph to trim the oil glut and boost prices at a time when the coronavirus continues to shrink demand.If the United States somehow managed to jump on board the price-fixing cartel, however, it might be enough to move the needle.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Saudi Aramco is considering a stake sale of its oil pipeline unit to raise some much-needed cash, as the reality of the oil price war it started with Russia sets in: the Saudi's move to crush other oil producers may be too successful, leaving the world's largest oil company rather cash poor along with the rest of the world.The sale of a piece of its pipeline unit could bring in $10 billion, at a time when Aramco is facing billions in payments due in 2020: $75 billion in dividend payments and the first installment for its SABIC acquisition. Those financial obligations will now prove an arduous task for Aramco, who is still actively drowning the oil market in oil. Meanwhile, the coronavirus has destroyed demand for crude oil. The combination has created a perfect storm for oil prices, sending WTI below $20 per barrel on Monday, and Brent crude below $26.Arab Light is trading just below $23, which is well below what most analysts suspect is their true breakeven, which factors in what Saudi Arabia's budget requires to balance. Aramco pays 50% of its net profits to the state, and a 20% royalty of its oil sales to the state for the use of the oilfields.Despite the tough times that Saudi Arabia is going through of its own volition, it is still aggressively pursuing its pump-at-will policy and increased exports that have included Saudi Arabia commissioning VLCCs above and beyond its own fleet to carry all the extra oil to market.The proposed pipeline stake sale will only offset a portion of the bills that will come due for Aramco this year, and Saudi Arabia will not be able to withstand these low oil prices indefinitely. Still, Saudi Arabia is in a tough spot and feels the need to save face in this oil price war.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "title": "The Most Expensive Oil And Gasoline In The World",
        "content": "Whether or not you follow oil markets, you will likely have seen articles in the media lately claiming that the price of oil has fallen to $20, or that it could possibly fall to $10. The truth about the oil market, however, is far more complex than that. The number quoted in media headlines usually refers to one of two types of crude oil. Often it is the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI), also known as Texas light sweet, a benchmark for light oil that is generally produced in the Permian Basin in Texas. It can also refer to Brent Crude, a benchmark for sweet light oil extracted from the North Sea which prices two-thirds of the world's internationally traded crude supplies. But to say 'oil prices' have just hit $20 is entirely inaccurate when referring to different international blends.The price of much of the oil in Canada is far lower than either Brent or WTI at the moment, with Western Canadian Select currently priced at just over $6. Meanwhile, oil blends from Indonesia, Russia, and Iraq are all trading at above $30. But the most expensive crude in the world is likely selling for far more than that. Earlier this year, Australian company Santos sold a 550,000-barrel cargo of the Pyrenees crude grade for loading in March, at a premium of over US$30 over the price of Dated Brent. At the time, that would have been a cost of around $100 per barrel for the prized Pyrenees oil. In today's environment, that same premium would mean Pyrenees oil bring sold at upwards of $56. Unfortunately, due to a lack of transparency in markets, there currently is no public information on those oil sales. As for the cheapest oil on the market at the moment, Wyoming General Sour would certainly be one of them, selling at $2.75 on Friday.Just like crude oil, the price of gasoline can fluctuate wildly depending on where you are fuelling up and the different tax policy of the country or state you are in. The current price of NYMEX traded gasoline futures is $0.61 per gallon, which is probably a lot less than how much you paid when you last filled up your gasoline tank. In fact, if you were to try and fill up a tank in Hawaii today you would find yourself paying $3.306 per gallon. If you were in Hong Kong, however, you could spend upwards of $8.48  per gallon at a gas station. And even those numbers don't tell the full story, because the true price of gasoline anywhere in the world is relative to your spending power. The most expensive gasoline in the world when taking that into account is India, where an average citizen could spend more than 80 percent of their daily wage on one gallon of gas. In Venezuela, by comparison, a gallon of gasoline has been recorded to cost 0.95 percent of the average daily wage - although with the country currently suffering through an intense economic crisis at the moment that figure should be taken with a grain of salt. The U.S. is two places below Venezuela on that list, with a gallon costing 1.64 percent of the average daily wage.So next time you see prices quoted for either gasoline or crude oil, remember that the only thing it really represents is the general trend in the global cost of those products. The real price at any given location or time could vary significantly.By Josh Owens for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

To this end, the company will spend $8.6 billion (61.1 billion yuan) on upstream exploration and production, with a focus on one oil field in northwestern China and two shale gas fields in southwestern China.The spending cuts will be in the company's oil refining business while investments in petrochemicals will increase by $1.4 billion (9.9. billion yuan), Sinopec also said.Earlier this month, the South China Morning Post reported the low oil price environment that has pressured the profits of Sinopec, and its peers might prove to be a boon to independent refiners.\"They are rushing to place orders to take advantage of the low price,\" one Chinese analyst said. \"The benefits will become clear from April when deliveries arrive.\"By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Global capital expenditure (capex) for exploration and production firms (E&Ps) is expected to drop by up to $100 billion this year, about 17% versus 2019 levels, under Rystad Energy's updated base case scenario of $34 per barrel in 2020 and $44 per barrel in 2021.E&P capex in 2019 reached $546 billion according to Rystad Energy estimates, having slightly recovered from a 2-year slump in 2015 and 2016 before diving to around $510 billion from 2014's historical high of $880 billion.According to our data the expected decline this year will make 2020's capex volumes, estimated at about $450 billion, the lowest in 13 years. Our estimates before the coronavirus epidemic had indicated E&P would remain flat year-on-year.As April approaches, when OPEC+ producers are expected to flood the market with even more additional oil, Brent prices are now at nearly $25 per barrel and are likely to decline even further.In a low case scenario, where Brent averages $25 in 2020, global investments may plunge to around $380 billion this year, falling to almost $300 billion in 2021, a 14-year and a 15-year low respectively.\"As companies are now losing solid oil market ground for a second time in recent years, it will be far more challenging to act quickly and reach the same high level of investment revision without taking a heavy toll on E&P's performance,\" says Rystad Energy's upstream analyst Olga Savenkova.The estimated cost cuts will be mainly achieved by lower activity within US shale, delays to projects that are yet to reach the final investment decision (FID) stage, deferred exploration activity, and cost cuts within development and production for conventional assets.Related: Why Are Tesla Cars So Popular?As the most flexible of the supply segments in terms of cost reduction, US shale players are expected to reduce their investments by about 30% year-on-year. These measures will be quickly reflected in the oil market supply, with shale oil supply growth set to slow down in 2020.Among the world's largest oil companies, global leader Saudi Aramco is slashing its upstream capital expenditure by 20% to protect its balance sheet amid declining oil prices. Despite the turbulent oil market, we still expect the company to go ahead with strategically important projects, having one of the lowest costs per barrel within the industry.ExxonMobil is also considering at least a 20% investment cut, but these plans have not yet been finalized. Considering the company's underperformance, even deeper cuts may be required to meet most of its important operational targets; it posted weak numbers for the fourth quarter of 2019, announced $20 billion worth of divestments planned for 2020, and maintains big ambitions for exploration and development in Guyana.Shell will also embrace a 20% total cut strategy, but we expect that upstream budgets will only see reductions of about 14%. The company is also committed to a divestment program of more than $10 billion worth of assets, which could prove challenging to conduct in the current market. BP has also announced potential plans for a 20% cost reduction. Even though the company holds a geographically diverse and resilient portfolio, we believe its $15 billion asset-sale target might not be accomplished.

This is the market situation in which front-month prices are lower than prices in future months, pointing to a crude oil oversupply and making storing oil for future sales profitable.  The contango has further widened in recent days as oil demand everywhere in the world flops, and traders are scrambling to secure storage at sea to profit from the current low oil prices.The run on supertankers during the massive glut and the Saudi supply surge sent supertanker rates for the route from the Middle East to China jumping to $180,000 a day on Monday. That's double from the $90,000 a day rate in the middle of last week, and up from the $125,000 a day rate on Friday, sources at shipbrokers told Reuters.\"Almost all the spot [tanker] deals right now have floating storage tied into them - that's the only way to make money.

        "content": "The spreading coronavirus pandemic may too heavy of a burden for the already struggling coal miners in the United States, with three companies announcing operations halts due to measures to contain the spread of the disease.Australia's Coronado Global Resources (ASX: CRN) announced on Sunday it had idled its US thermal and metallurgical coal mines due to covid-19-induced global economic downturn.The company, which operates the Buchanan, Logan and Greenbrier mine complexes in Virginia and West Virginia, will keep its Curragh mine in Australia open.The operation, which accounts for 65% of Coronado's output and earnings, will accommodate metallurgical coal export requirements of the miner's key customers in India and the Asia Pacific, as well as to the Stanwell Power Station, a Queensland government owned entityGiven the significant stockpile of US inventories and continued production from Curragh, operating cash flows are expected to remain positive, Coronado said.The miner also noted that its US operations will be maintained for immediate restart when market conditions improve and that shipments to Europe, Brazil and the US itself will continue.Pennsylvania-based Consol Energy (NYSE: CEIX) said on Monday it is temporarily curtailing production at its Bailey coal mine in Pennsylvania for two weeks after two employees tested positive for the coronavirus.The miner said it's keeping its Pennsylvania Complex, including the Enlow Fork and Harvey mines, in operation.The complex has the capacity to produce 28.5 million tonnes of coal a year, while the halted Bailey mine accounts for 11.5 million annual tonnes of the total capacity.Alliance Resource Partners (NASDAQ: ARLP) said Monday it would temporarily stop producing coal at all its Illinois basin mines as global measures to combat the virus had crushed demand for energy. In addition, the price war sparked by Saudi Arabia and Russia had lowered oil prices even more, it noted.Alliance also said it was withdrawing its initial 2020 operating and financial guidance provided in January, which did not reflect the impact of the virus. \"Although we are suspending formal guidance, we currently anticipate ARLP's total sales tons for 2020 will be approximately 25% below our initial expectations,\" president and chief executive, Joseph Craft, said in the statement.The operations halt is scheduled to last through April 15, though the coal miner said resuming production could be accelerated or extended, based on the business needs of its customers.\"It is important to note that approximately 75% of our domestic sales are targeted to states that depend on coal, more than any other fuel, to generate electricity,\" Craft said.The announcements come as the pandemic has rapidly expanded across the US, where the death toll could reach 100,000 people in the coming weeks.Industry declineMoody's Investor Services said on Thursday it expected further closures and bankruptcies within the US coal industry as domestic demand for coal was set to drop in the near-term due to the country's economy shut-down to try reducing the numbers of coronavirus patients.A slower economic activity is also cutting down US electricity demand, which together with stronger environmental, social and governance concerns could represent \"an unprecedented shock\" to the coal industry.\"Before the intensification of the coronavirus pandemic in the US, we expected that coal production would fall by 15%-20% in the US, to about 550 million st-600 million st,\" Moody's said. \"We now expect that the industry conditions will worsen beyond this forecast.\"The volume of coal mined in the US has been declining for the past decade, although burning the fuel still accounts for almost one-quarter of all the country's electricity generation.Jobs in the sector also continue to shrink. While there are over 129 million people employed by businesses in the US, there are only about 50,000 coal miners, or 0.04% of the country's total number of people employed by the industry.The latest jobs report, published in early March, shows that there are fewer people employed by the coal sector now (50,600 as of February) than three years ago (50,900 in January 2017).By Mining.comMore Top Reads from Oilprice.com:"

According to the daily, Moscow paid for the Venezuelan assets in Rosneft stock, which is where the reduction of the state's interest in the company came from. The value of the deal was 9.6 percent in Rosneft.Rosneft announced its pullout from Venezuela over the weekend without going into details about the reasons. However, these are obvious enough and boil down to the effect of U.S. oil sanctions on the company.Earlier this year, Washington announced sanctions on Rosneft's Swiss-based trading arm as part of its attempts to cut off all revenue streams to the Maduro government in Caracas. The U.S. has signaled that it is ready to tighten even more the noose around the Venezuelan government. \"Today Rosneft concluded an agreement with the company 100% owned by the Government of Russian Federation, to sell all of its interest and cease participation in its Venezuelan businesses, including joint ventures of Petromonagas, Petroperija, Boqueron, Petromiranda and Petrovictoria, as well as oil-field services companies, commercial and trading operations,\" the state giant said in a press release on Saturday.Meanwhile, Venezuela's oil production fell to the lowest in five months, Reuters reported yesterday, with the total average at some 670,000 bpd, according to documents and unnamed sources.

This production level was about 7 percent lower than the 2018 average and less than half its production rate from 2004, Reuters reported at the time.The previous government tried to reverse the decline by liberalizing the country's energy industry and inviting foreign companies to bid for Mexican oil fields. The results of this opening up have yet to be seen, although there has been successful exploration offshore.However, as the government changed, the new administration changed the approach and bet on greater state participation in the energy industry, with president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador pledging a substantial increase in production by the end of his term in office, to 2.5 million bpd. Between 2019 and 2020, Pemex had planned a production increase of 300,000 bpd.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

Get to the front of the queue!\" a European trader told Reuters as regional grades in Europe, the United States, and Canada hit their lowest levels in decades as demand continues to fall off a cliff and storage, where available, continues to fill.Analysts expect 20 million bpd demand loss in April globally--this would be a 20-percent plunge in the typical 100-million-bpd global oil demand.Refiners are cutting crude oil processing rates in Europe and North America, as major economies are either in lockdown or with tight travel restrictions, destroying millions of barrels of oil per day of oil demand for gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel.On top of the colossal demand loss, Saudi Arabia's promise to flood the market with extra barrels of deeply discounted oil as of April 1 is putting additional pressure on the already deeply depressed physical crude markets in Europe and the U.S.Therefore, prices for regional grades are trading at record discounts to the benchmark futures. While WTI Crude slumped to US$19 at one point in Monday trading, Mars US, the sour crude grade from the U.S. Gulf Coast, hit US$10 a barrel, the widest discount to the U.S. benchmark since 2008, according to Reuters estimates. WTI for delivery at the Magellan East Houston (MEH) terminal, a key export grade from the Gulf Coast, was priced at US$6 per barrel below the WTI Crude benchmark, the widest discount on record. Canada's Western Canadian Select (WCS) traded at below US$5 a barrel on Monday.  Traders are offering physical crude from the U.S. to Europe for May as early as in March, compared to what they would typically do in April in a 'normal' market, as they scramble to offload with buyers what could turn out to be distressed barrels of oil as demand is set to continue to plummet in the coming weeks.

Meanwhile, traders are still holding onto a smidgeon of hope that there will be some relief coming in the form of a ceasefire to the oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia.  Further complicating prices are new national guidelines for how the United States will deal with the coronavirus going forward--a development that will impact the demand for crude.At 3:24 pm EDT on Tuesday the WTI benchmark was trading up on the day by $0.35 (+1.74%) at $20.44. While up on the day, WTI is still trading down nearly $4 week on week for the second week in a row. The price of a Brent barrel, on the other hand, was trading down on Tuesday, by $0.20 (-0.76%), at $26.22--down by roughly $3 week on week.The API reported a large build of 6.085 million barrels of gasoline for week ending March 27, after last week's 2.622-million-barrel draw. This week's build compares to analyst expectations for a 1.949-million-barrel build for the week.Distillate inventories were down, by 4.458 million barrels for the week, compared to last week's 1.90-million-barrel draw, while Cushing inventories rose by 2.926 million barrels.US crude oil production as estimated by the Energy Information Administration showed that production for the week ending March 20 slipped back slightly to 13.0 million bpd.At 4:33 pm EDT, WTI was trading at $20.36 while Brent was trading at $26.17.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

The regime's nuclear extortion is among the greatest threats to international peace and security,\" State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said in a statement.President Donald Trump's unilateral withdrawal in 2018 from a landmark nuclear deal with Iran that included signatories Britain, Germany, France, Russia, and China, saw U.S. sanctions reimposed on Tehran, crippling its economy, which is mostly reliant on oil exports.The deal, brokered in 2015, envisioned sanctions relief if Iran curbed its nuclear ambitions.Since withdrawing from the deal, Washington has pursued a \"maximum pressure\" campaign aimed at reducing Iran's regional activities and limiting its nuclear missile program.The waivers allow nonproliferation work to continue at the Arak heavy-water research reactor, the Bushehr nuclear power plant, the Tehran Research Reactor, and other nuclear initiatives.The United States will continue to closely monitor all developments in Iran's nuclear program and can adjust the restrictions at any time, Ortagus said.\"As President Trump said earlier this year, Iran will never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon,\" she said.Earlier this month, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said that Iran had been blocking international nuclear inspectors from investigating possible nuclear activities at two sites.The Vienna-based agency also said Tehran had exceeded its uranium stockpiles beyond the limits set by the 2015 nuclear deal.Iranian authorities have blamed Washington's policies and sanctions for hampering its ability to cope with the coronavirus pandemic.More than 41,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases have been recorded, including over 2,700 attributable deaths, according to a tracking monitor by the U.S.-based Johns Hopkins University.Iran is one of the countries worst hit by the virus, and experts have been skeptical about the veracity of official figures released by the Islamic regime, which keeps a tight lid on local and foreign media.By RFE/RLMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

An Iranian official told Iran's state television that it was a terrorist attack that led to the explosion of the pipeline.\"This morning, terrorists attacked a natural gas pipeline inside Turkey near Iran's Bazargan border with Turkey ...

It was likely that PKK, Kurdistan's Workers Party, was responsible for the blast, Dana told IRNA.The pipeline moves around 10 billion cubic meters of Iranian gas to Turkey every year. It has been the target of attack by Kurdish militants between the 1990s and 2013, when the parties agreed on a ceasefire, according to IRNA.Related: Russia's Plan To Bankrupt U.S. Shale Could Send Oil To $60Turkey also confirmed a blast had occurred on the pipeline, with the Anadolu Agency reporting that the fire was extinguished and the military had secured the area near the Gurbulak border crossing, known as Bazargan in Iran.

        "content": "Shell expects the price collapse to lead to post-tax impairment charges of between US$400 million and U$800 million for the first quarter this year, the oil supermajor said on Tuesday in an updated note on the Q1 financials. Shell, which will report first-quarter earnings on April 30, reiterated today that as per previous disclosures, the price impact on the group's cash flow from operations (CFFO) is estimated at US$6 billion per year for each US$10 per barrel Brent price movement.   \"As a result of COVID-19, we have seen and expect significant uncertainty with macro-economic conditions with regards to prices and demand for oil, gas and related products. Furthermore, recent global developments and uncertainty in oil supply have caused further volatility in commodity markets,\" Shell said in a statement today. \"The impact of the dynamically evolving business environment on first quarter results is being primarily reflected in March with a relatively minor impact in the first two months,\" the supermajor noted, adding that it would provide more updates on the Q1 results and outlook for the year at the results release at the end of April. Given the slump in fuel demand with major economies in lockdown for weeks, and probably months, Shell will slow down refinery production, with refinery utilization expected at 80-84 percent, with availability expected at 93-96 percent.   \"Refining margins are expected to be weaker compared with the fourth quarter 2019,\" Shell said. Weaker refining margins and lower realized oil, gas, and liquefied natural gas (LNG) prices had already weighed on Shell's profit in Q4 2019. With the price collapse in Q1 2020, Shell, like all other majors, hastened to announce capital expenditure (capex) cuts to protect its balance sheet from crashing oil prices. Majors also started to prioritize investments in the low-price environment. Just yesterday, Shell announced that in light of the current market conditions, the group would exit the proposed Lake Charles LNG project in Louisiana. \"This decision is consistent with the initiatives we announced last week to preserve cash and reinforce the resilience of our business,\" said Maarten Wetselaar, Director, Integrated Gas and New Energies, Shell. \"Whilst we continue to believe in the long-term viability and advantages of the project, the time is not right for Shell to invest.\"    By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com: "

        "title": "How Coronavirus And An Assassination Could Transform Iran",
        "content": "Iran has lacked viable, legitimate, and representative governance since February 1979. That has been demonstrated by its social and economic performance domestically. Its clerical Government has not been prepared to trust the population, and the population, as a result, has not trusted the Government.Equally, however, external powers -- friendly or unfriendly -- have constrained Iran since 1979 from progressing as a normal member of the international community. This was a response to the behavior of the Iranian Government, but it was often counter-productive.The current transformation of the international strategic and economic balance -- resulting from the 2019-20 COVID-19 crisis and the attendant global \"fear pandemic\" -- has taken the outlook for Iran into a new arena. The COVID-19 crisis management by the clerical Government was seen as so inept that the remaining trust levels in government by the public appeared to have evaporated.The one \"man on horseback\", who appeared to be able to galvanize a sense of national pride and direction -- Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani -- was killed in his war against the US, and governmental behavior since his death on January 2, 2020, has been haphazard and domestically divisive.US thoughts on possibly taking advantage of the internal disarray in Iran included the announcement on March 20, 2020, that the US Navy had deployed two supercarrier strike groups -- around USS Dwight D. Eisenhower and USS Harry S. Truman -- with unspecified purpose. That deployment seems destined, if escalated, only to galvanize the support of a reluctant Iranian population around the failed clerical Administration.Related: Is This The Beginning Of The End For Texas Oil?Iranians consistently rally around their government when a foreign threat appears.The US, Iran, and others have failed to learn that repeating failed policies does not improve the chances of their success.In viewing Iran's prospects, it is essential to understand that most policies by and toward Iran for more than four decades have been poorly-conceived and counter-productive.The exceptions are that:- (a) The policies of the ruling clerics of Iran have been geared solely to the preservation of their power, and these have worked; and- (b) The policies of Iraq (1980s), Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (supported by the US) have been designed to cause, lead, or demand an international isolation of Iran, and these have partially worked.Neither of those policy streams has benefited the Iranian public nor the international community.It could be argued that both of those draconian policies -- of preservation of power domestically, and international containment -- did provide an opportunity for Russia (after 1990) and the People's Republic of China (PRC) to gain some traction in the region because they kept the US and the West generally at bay. So there have been limited benefits for Moscow and Beijing, the most notable being the avoidance of an opportunity for a reassertion of Western influence.There is no evidence that, since the departure of the Shah from Iran in early 1979, Saudi Arabia's security has benefited from the failure to develop a viable modus vivendi with Iran.The global economic breakdown into what, at least for a brief period, will be a depression will have a profound impact on Iran. Of primary initial importance will be the contraction of demand for Iranian oil and gas from the PRC and Japan, not just in terms of volume, but in terms of price. Allies (a term which needs to be qualified) Russia, Turkey, and Qatar (and to some extent Iraq and Syria) can do little for Iran at this time, particularly in the critical area of need: food supply.Absent an improvement in food supply, all domestic political crises will be exacerbated, particularly in light of the Government's poor response to the COVID-19 contagion which resulted from the clerical Government accepting PRC pressure to sustain unfettered air links between the two countries, thus exposing Iran to a higher-than-necessary level of risk to COVID-19.By March 30, 2020, the Government acknowledged that COVID-19 deaths were 2,757 out of a confirmed caseload of 41,495. In fact, the contagion rate in Iran at that point was an absolute unknown, and was clearly much higher than official \"confirmed cases\", and the death toll was also much higher. The lack of a clear understanding of the dimension of the health threat further exacerbated public mistrust in the Government.Related: An Oilman's Plea To President TrumpIran's porous border with Turkey may well have contributed to the situation in that country where informed estimates of contagion were that some 60 percent of the Turkish population had contracted COVID-19.Iranian Pres. Hasan Rouhani made the case on March 29, 2020, that sustained US economic sanctions against Iran were to blame for Iran's situation. In fact, while the sanctions may have inhibited the Government's late-starting attempts to respond to the epidemic, the cause of the high-rate initial contagion was entirely due to the Government's submission to PRC demands for constant, open travel from affected PRC areas to Iran.What, then, is to happen to Iran, and what should or could the Western response be to the changing situation?- Iran's Government is reaching a watershed in its ability to impose further constraints on public discontent, but, equally, the internal opposition lacks cohesion, energy, and resources. A military-led solution may occur if, for example, Supreme Leader Ali Hoseini Khamene'i relinquishes power or dies.- The US must decide whether, at this historical point, it wants to devote increasingly limited resources to supporting the domestic opposition as part of a strategy to constrain the PRC. Washington first must understand Iran, which it arguably has not understood since Pres. Richard Nixon (1969-74), the last US President to balance Iran and Saudi Arabia.As with all good battlefield sieges, the besieger must offer hope to the besieged. For Iran, hope must be in the restoration of its historical civilizational glory.By GIS/Defense & Foreign Affairs StaffMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

Our estimates show that total oil demand in 2019 was approximately 99.9 million bpd, which is now projected to decline to 93.5 million bpd in 2020. To put the number into context, last week we projected a decrease of 4.9 million bpd.At the moment we expect the month of April to take the biggest hit, with demand for oil estimated at 77.6 million bpd, falling by 22.8 million bpd year on year, a 22.7 percent drop from our pre-coronavirus forecast.This downgrade takes into account developments that have occurred up to and including Tuesday, March 31.Road fuel demand:We believe that global total demand for road fuels will fall by 5.5 percent, or 2.6 million bpd year-on-year, a downgrade from last week's report, where road fuels were expected to decline by just 4.6 percent.Road fuel demand in 2019 is estimated to have reached 47.7 million bpd. We now see it reaching only about 45.1 million bpd in 2020.Most of this reduction will also take effect in April, which will see its road fuel demand limited to just 34.7 million bpd globally, from 47.6 million bpd a year ago.Jet fuel demand:Among the various fuel sectors, we expect jet fuel to be hit the hardest. We expect global commercial air traffic will fall by at least 21 percent this year versus the levels seen in 2019, which we estimate stood at around 99,700 flights per day. This number will be revised as operators continue to cut routes.Many distressed airlines are now facing heavy cost cuts, laying-off unprecedented numbers of employees as many non-essential routes are closed.As a base case, we now assume that the common summer air travel peak will not occur at all this year. We now see jet fuel demand falling by almost 26 percent year-on-year, or by at least 1.9 million bpd. Last year's demand for jet fuel was seen at about 7.2 million bpd.By Rystad EnergyMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

In combination with our USD 3 billion action plan to reduce cost, this transaction will further strengthen our financial resilience and flexibility going forward, and ensure liquidity to prioritised projects,\" chief financial officer Lars Christian Bacher said.The Norwegian heavyweight earlier this year announced a capital and cost cut program of $3 billion. It also announced a postponement of its $5 billion share buyback program, in line with the actions of its peers, which have also been cutting spending plans and suspending share buybacks.As part of its cost-cut program, Equinor said it would cut organic capital expenditure to $8.5 billion from $10-11 billion. The company said it would also reduce its exploration budget for this year to $1 billion from $1.4 billion. Operating costs for the year, Equinor said, would be cut by $700 million.\"Equinor is in a strong financial position to handle market volatility and uncertainty. Our strategy remains firm, and we are now taking actions to further strengthen our resilience in this situation with the spread of the coronavirus and low commodity prices,\" chief executive Eldar Saetre said at the time.Equinor may be in a strong position, but the current market volatility is being called unprecedented by many. The oil price slide has been steep and quick and has occurred in an environment of severely depressed demand, which is indeed unusual and has sparked fears that unless radical measures are taken quickly, prices could fall a lot further.

Saudi Arabia is now producing more than 12 million barrels per day, according to Reuters sources, even though oil demand has dropped off a cliff in recent weeks.The meeting will take place on Friday at the White House, and will include executives from Chevron, Exxon, and Occidental Petroleum, according to the Wall Street Journal.The U.S. Shale industry has fallen on hard times, caught between the oversupply and the drop off in demand, and the low gasoline prices are a lousy consolation prize to the Administration that has touted America's growing energy independence.U.S. lawmakers have expressed growing concern for the U.S. oil industry, urging the President to levy tariffs on OPEC's oil. The Texas Railroad Commission has even thrown out the idea of its own production cuts to producers in the state.The idea of a tariff has been proposed by Senators Roger Wicker and Jim Inhofe, who cited national security as a reason to slap tariffs on foreign oil.The talks about the tariff come after the United States said it might join oil production talks between Russia and Saudi Arabia.

        "content": "Indian Oil Corp (IOC), the country's biggest refiner and fuel retailer, has declared a force majeure on oil imports from some of its top oil suppliers, including Saudi Arabia, which has been promising a supply surge as of today in the price war it leads with Russia.After India - population 1.3 billion people - went into a nationwide lockdown, IOC slashed refinery runs and declared a force majeure on imports from four key Middle Eastern suppliers--Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), India's Economic Times reported on Wednesday, citing sources.The top Indian refiner has asked these four suppliers to defer some of the cargoes they were set to deliver to India in April after the country went last week into a three-week-long nationwide lockdown, and demand for transportation fuel, as well as demand from businesses, craters. Saudi Arabia has not responded to IOC's request for deferral of cargoes yet, according to Economic Times' sources.  India, the world's third-largest oil importer, and key growth driver together with China, put a spoke in Saudi Arabia's wheel just as the Kingdom pledges to boost its oil exports to record-highs in the coming weeks.The Saudis have discounted deeply their oil for April, aiming to grab market share from Russia, and from everyone else for that matter, after Moscow refused to continue playing ball in the OPEC+ production cut deal. Unfortunately for Saudi Arabia, there's no demand for its oil right now, regardless of how cheap it is. Major economies, including India's, went into lockdown to try to flatten the curve of the coronavirus spreading, which crippled global oil demand. Analysts expect 20 million bpd demand loss in the coming weeks--this would be a 20 percent drop compared to the world's 100-million-bpd typical oil consumption.    It's not only India that is not rushing to buy ultra-cheap Saudi crude because of plunging demand. Saudi Arabia has promised a flood of cheap oil to Europe as it aims to hit its former ally Russia in its own backyard, but it looks like demand for the ultra-cheap Saudi crude doesn't exist after all.Despite the flood of cheap oil Saudi Arabia has promised, some refiners in Europe, including supermajor Shell, are set to take less crude from the Kingdom in April amid plummeting demand in the coronavirus pandemic, Reuters reported last week, quoting industry sources.

        "content": "Major economies should pursue currency agreements to stabilize the US dollar, especially during the COVID-19 crisis, preventing a rapid rise against other currencies that is sure to trigger calls for protectionist measures.There is historical precedent. In 1985, the US dollar soared. The United States, West Germany, Japan, France and the United Kingdom - the Group of 5 world powers - met at the Plaza Hotel in New York on a Sunday in September, when markets were closed. Four nations agreed to appreciate their currencies to depreciate the US dollar. Rising dollar: With market volatility, investors seek safety with holdings in US dollars, hiking the currency's value in recent months (Source: Reuters)Multilateralism and discrete action were necessary to realign exchange rate stability and counter the strong dollar in the early 1980s, with particular significance to West Germany and Japan, two former adversaries that were gobbling up increased US industrial output.Former US Treasury Secretary James Baker III convened the meeting, expressing concern about rising protectionist sentiment among US industrial interests over an account deficit for the United States and surpluses posted by Japan and Germany. The meeting, held in stealth, was based on Baker's close relationship with then-President Ronald Reagan, whose trust he had gained earlier as chief-of-staff. Baker's idea ran counter to Reagan's policy about controlling inflation with a strong dollar, but the president listened and liked the idea, knowing that protectionism over the long haul would do more to damage markets than promote domestic interests.The global economy faces a more calamitous situation today, namely with the COVID-19 pandemic, which has destabilized world markets and caused the dollar to rally against other world major currencies in a few weeks. Countries have feasted on cheaper, liquid dollars for several years and now the piper calls.In essence, a new Plaza Accord is necessary, even more so than in 1985, to soothe market volatility. Nonetheless, consider the many monetary changes over the last 35 years that may preclude such action:- World capital markets are much deeper, more complex and electronically integrated than in 1985.- Unilateralism, not multilateralism, is the guiding theme that most countries now pursue, as led by the United States.- China, a dollar-backed economy, would not readily agree to the depreciation of its vast dollar holdings.Related: Trump Proposes A $2 Trillion Infrastructure InterventionFirst, regarding the capital markets, dollar credit accounts for 14 percent of all non-bank global GDP as of 2018. In fact there are more $100 bills circulating worldwide than $1 bills, with 80 percent outside the United States. Bonds, loans and payments around the world are today denominated in dollars. These are not dollars owed to the United States, but rather covenants made between various parties that rely on the dollar as the most stable currency and the only game in town. The financial calamity caused by the coronavirus has delayed payments in king dollar, with numerous defaults expected soon or debts called in by creditors early. This has precipitated a global ripple. Dollars must be had, and quickly, or depreciating local currencies will result. The crisis has not spared even so-called safe-haven currencies such as the Japanese yen and Swiss franc from volatility, due to their liquidity for such payments. During crises, lenders seek to minimize risk. Further, commodity currencies, such as the Norwegian krone and Canadian dollar, which garner most of their support from stable oil prices, quickly depreciated with Saudi Arabia and Russia warring over oil-production cuts in the face of slackening demand.Second, with unilateralism, protectionism ensues. Countries try to contain the carnage on their own. Coordinated leadership is required. The US president, strongly unilateralist, seeks to influence economic policy directly. In the process, he has undermined trust among nation-states that he perceives as abusing US markets. This contrasts with Reagan's style in 1985, authorizing Baker to pursue multilateral negotiations on his own. Massive credit \"swap\" lines, contracts recently opened by the US Treasury to reduce risks and assist aligned countries with dollar loans, are not enough to stem the tidal wave of demand. There are simply not enough dollars in the system to placate all outstanding dollar indebtedness. These debts include dollar-denominated sovereign and corporate issues from countries like Indonesia or Nigeria, which were later sold on world markets. Such bonds were not only absorbed by US investors, but also by those in the United Kingdom, Singapore, Dubai, and China.Third, China holds more foreign exchange reserves than any other country in the world, at last count, around $3 trillion. Foreign exchange is synonymous with the US dollar, generally speaking, with 62 percent of world reserves in dollars and euros a distant second at 20 percent. It would work against Chinese interests to devalue the yuan further. China, not a party to the 1985 Plaza Accord, is today the second-largest economy in the world, and its vast dollar reserves have assisted the nation in weathering financial storms better than other countries. Much of this was born during the financial crisis in 1997 when most Asian countries lacked the dollar reserves necessary to placate the stampede on local currencies.Yet such an agreement is unlikely.This time, developing countries are loaded for bear, hoarding dollars to the extreme. Nonetheless, many developing countries, such as Nigeria, Lebanon, and Turkey, have a much larger dollar debt-to-reserve ratio, even with large holdings, and feel the dollar squeeze.Slowdown: International trade growth was already slowing when the COVID-19 pandemic hit, triggering protectionist instincts and hoarding of US dollars (Source: Visual Capitalist)Nothing would assuage world markets more than orderly depreciation of the US dollar, with stabilization and appreciation of other currencies. A multilateral approach - conducted by a handful of leading finance ministers, with the backing of strong US financial leadership, away from news media - might calm global markets. None would want to tip the markets early, similar to the 1985 agreement when orderly depreciation of the dollar occurred and accomplished the immediate goal of rebalancing the dollar.Related: U.S. Drillers Face Doomsday Scenario As Some Crude Blends Hit $1Today, the G20 has many more actors, many with political tendencies that resist the appearances of compromise. The European Union's euro, successor to the French franc and Deutsche Mark, did not exist in 1985. Further, the digital world instantaneously conveys currency moves of any type. Any sudden market move would invite not only speculators but also reactionary capital controls from governments, both on dollar holdings and domestic currency. Nonetheless, this trying time of pandemic and collapsed oil prices mandates compromise and multilateral action - along with cooperation from a US president who holds his position based on \"America first\" policies.To be precise, the Plaza Accords were a prescription to soothe a short-term symptom of uncontrolled dollar strength, exactly what the world experiences now. Soon afterward, another agreement, the 1987 Louvre Accord in Paris, halted the dollar's 18-month decline, exacerbated by speculators. Once again, the G5 agreed to exchange their currencies in a range, with a compromise between a pure floating and fixed-exchange-rate system. Japan was recognized as a world financial powerhouse during the Plaza Accord, and swelling of the yen's value from Y=250 to Y=150 per dollar in a few months contributed to asset bubbles and fiscal mismanagement, eventually leading to stagnant growth and the \"lost decade\" of the 1990s for the Japanese economy. Nevertheless, the real target of both accords was West Germany, with its growing industrial might threatening to overwhelm US industry with an artificially low Deutsche-Mark exchange rate.Left unchecked, a soaring dollar will wreak havoc in emerging markets with rising inflation, collapsing currencies and a decline in US competitiveness. The 1985 agreement may have marked the last great initiative for multilateral control of the dollar's ascendancy.By Will Hickey via Yale Global Online More Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "title": "Lockdown Strikes Utilities As Electricity Demand Plunges",
        "content": "Electric utilities around the world, like other industries, are not immune to the unpleasant financial effects stemming from the covid19 pandemic. While electricity customers \"shelter in place,\" sales to commercial and industrial customers have dropped off substantially. Utility companies serving highly industrialized regions should see the biggest negative impacts at least on a near to intermediate term basis.Stores close. Factories close. People are out of work. Sales volume drops. Customers will not or cannot pay their bills. What do utilities do?A few weeks ago, a medium-sized gas company, Chesapeake Utilities, announced that it would suspend service disconnections through May 1. In the past these actions were principally designed to target elderly and low income customers often with some regulatory nudges. This time we are not even sure the company waited for regulators before acting. Even more radically, Brazilian water utility SABESP announced it was suspending billing to customers in poor neighborhoods. The rationale was that as a public utility, or a public service institution, water related hygiene was a crucial necessity in the present fight against COVID-19.US utilities have a long-standing tradition, often dictated by regulators, not to disconnect residential service in the dead of winter for non payment. But this looks different. Electricity is a relatively small portion of a typical household's expenses. And given its importance to modern life a bill that most customers pay if able. For a utility to pre-emptively recognize potential for widespread non payment speaks to a far broader concern.And it is at this point we need to remind readers that the industry is regulated. In countries which permit private ownership of power generation and distribution, the bulk of industry profits derive from a return on assets dedicated to public service, not from actual kilowatt hour volumes sold. In the near term we expect kilowatt hour sales volumes will decline and regulated utilities will experience some loss of revenue and profits. The biggest losers, though, will be the unregulated power generators, gas producers and gas and electric retailers. Those already beleaguered businesses will take the hit, so to speak. They only generate revenues (and hopefully profits) based on the actual volumes of electricity or gas sold, not on the total amount of investment deployed to produce a highly desired commodity.Related: $1 Oil: Saudi Arabia's Attempt To Crush U.S. ShaleRegulated utilities are in a different position. They have public service obligations. We have no doubt utilities will not not suspend service. whether prompted by regulators or by voluntary action. At the end of the day regulated utilities get fully compensated for their \"generosity\" with respect to customers via their state public service commissions.The real question is whether the regulators socialize these revenue losses among all classes of customers and investors alike. When the going gets tough, the providers of capital are often asked to take a \"haircut\" on their expected return. Apart from scope and scale, this issue isn't new for utilities or regulators. Under utility accounting conventions, unpaid bills simply become deferred assets where they will eventually be recovered through rates paid by all electricity users, typically over a few years.In brief, it is good to be a regulated utility in perilous economic times. The vitality of the business itself is of critical importance to public welfare. And no matter how severe an economic disturbance, almost everyone derives benefit from well functioning electric companies. As a result, the ability of regulators to impose severe financial hardship--perhaps in the name of shared sacrifice--is limited. In fact the few times in recent memory we actually do see utility bankruptcies is when a liability is so large that it cannot be allocated for recovery according to existing regulatory principles.Looking to the future, we expect that if the present steep sales decline is short-lived, regulators will tell the utilities to absorb the the loss like everyone. else If the pandemic's economic consequences prove longer-lived, regulators might reluctantly permit price increases to elevate earnings to previously allowed levels. But here's the problem. Fuel and labor, both key inputs, must be paid on a timely basis or the utility rapidly ceases to function. Conceivable the providers of capital can wait. Or take less than they expected.Furthermore, regulators can take an elastic view of proper compensation to capital. The appropriate return on utility shareholders equity is a social as much as economic construct. It is a \"spread\" concept. The goal is to compensate equity investors for the business risk they assume in a specific utility. Typically this calculation can be understood as a spread over the risk free rate of return. The latter is typically understood as the yield on ten year US treasury bonds. Currently authorized returns on equity are say 9%, minus the risk free rate of 0.8%, equates to a spread of 8.2% or 820 basis points. This is rather wide from a historical perspective. As a result it represents from a regulatory perspective a sort of low hanging fruit. If cost savings are needed to keep rate levels manageable in a difficult period, cutting shareholder returns generates very little voter hostility as we enter an election season.Related: Shale Giant Files For Bankruptcy As Oil Price War Rages OnIn the end, regulated utilities will step up their public service role and forego revenues from customers willing, but for myriad reasons, unable to pay. If we're all lucky, utility investors will eventually be made whole albeit perhaps on a delayed basis. Unregulated companies whose finances are driven by volumetric demand will suffer.As in nature, tectonic moves like those recently seen in the equity and credit markets expose rifts. Right now, investors are being paid quite handsomely to invest in electric utility equity versus the return on supposedly risk free bonds. If regulators suddenly need to cut the fat so to speak this is likely to be the first place they'll look. If so this may also on a worst case basis cause some companies to revise their dividend policies downward. Paradoxically this seemingly negative move, widespread dividend reductions--the absolute worst for an income investor--could signal the onset of a new bull market for utility equities.With the addition of transportation and new residential/commercial uses, electricity suppliers are poised for enormous growth in demand longer term. We are not accustomed to thinking about utilities as growth businesses. But if the growth we anticipate materializes, the value to investors is likely to be via stock appreciation as opposed to current income. This will be disappointing to income investors but this is the change we believe is coming. Like other things, no one is ever ready.By Leonard Hyman and William Tilles for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

According to the chief analyst of data analytics firm Kayrros, if storage continues to fill up, oil prices could fall close to zero. This zero space available could happen in months, if not weeks.U.S. West Texas Intermediate has been trading around $20 a barrel, but some regional grades have been faring a lot worse, with Wyoming asphalt sour even turning into negative territory.\"Large-scale production interruptions appear inevitable and imminent,\" Pioneer Natural Resources and Parsley Energy executives wrote in a letter to the Texas Railroad Commission. Pioneer also asked the industry body to order a production cut in what would be an unprecedented move to stem the price decline and the excess supply.The U.S. strategic petroleum reserve (SPR) has a maximum capacity of over 713 million barrels of crude. The U.S. created the SPR in the wake of the Arab oil embargo following the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, as the U.S. sought to avoid a repeat of the fuel shortages that the embargo caused at the time. There U.S. has some 635 million barrels in storage across the SPR facilities.If the White House opens the SPR to private producers, it would come as a much-needed relief for the troubled industry, although it wouldn't be enough to arrest the price decline.

        "content": "Restrictions on movement and trade as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic have led to a significant shift in consumer behaviour in Saudi Arabia, with locals increasingly turning to digital channels.Worldwide, cases of Covid-19 have risen to 859,000 and 42,000 deaths have been attributed to the virus as of the morning of April 1. However, Saudi Arabia has seen relatively few infections, with 1563 cases and 10 deaths to date.The Kingdom recorded its first case of Covid-19 on March 2, and the first virus-related fatality - a 51-year-old Afghani resident in the country - on March 23.The first death coincided with the introduction of a 21-day nationwide curfew, also announced on March 23, which prohibits people from leaving their homes between the hours of 7.00pm and 6.00am.This was followed two days later by a tightening of measures designed to stop the spread of the virus.The government announced a lockdown of the capital Riyadh and the holy cities Makkah and Medina. It also extended the curfew in all three places, bringing forward the start time to 3.00pm, while forbidding movement between all provinces in the Kingdom.In terms of international movements, all international flights were suspended on March 15 for a period of two weeks, with this period later extended until further notice.Significant boost for e-commerceDespite the comparatively limited medical impact on the Kingdom, the threat presented by the virus - alongside efforts to maintain social distancing - has led to a significant shift in lifestyle and consumer habits, with e-commerce experiencing a rapid spike in growth.Related: This Gulf State Faces An Impossible Decision As Oil War Rages OnIn late March local online retailer BinDawood Holding told local media that, since the escalation of the Covid-19 crisis, its average sales on a 10-day basis had increased by 200 percent, while its average order value rose by 50 percent and app installations by 400 percent.The company has two e-commerce platforms - BinDawood and Danube - which are connected to their respective supermarket and hypermarket chains, enabling customers to purchases groceries and other goods online.While the economic impacts of the virus have seen many businesses close and millions of people lose their jobs globally, BinDawood officials say the rapid growth in activity has helped the company buck these trends.All of the company's 72 stores remain open, including the newest Danube store, which opened last week in Riyadh's Al Andalus district. The company has also hired more packers and drivers to keep up with demand for online deliveries.Elsewhere, fellow Saudi grocery delivery app Nana has also benefitted from the recent turn towards online shopping, raising $18m in a Series B funding round in late March to expand operations across the Middle East, with investors including venture capital funds Saudi Technology Ventures and Middle East Venture Partners. This follows a Series A funding round that raised $6m last year.The company has expanded capacity three-fold following a surge in demand associated with the Covid-19 outbreak. This is expected to continue in light of the Saudi government's decision to impose tighter curfews in major cities.Looking ahead, retailers may need to adapt their supply chains in response to shifting market dynamics. \"Vertical integration is a pivotal development strategy, especially considering the recent spike in demand for e-commerce and fresh food delivery, which Saudi Arabia's supply can hardly meet,\" Seifallah Sharbatly, Managing Director of Sharbalty Fruit, told OBG.   Sector growth targetsThe emergence of online retail, albeit during a time of crisis, aligns with some of the goals of Saudi Arabia's overarching strategies.As part of the Financial Sector Development Programme - itself part of Vision 2030, the Kingdom's long-term development plan - the government hopes to increase the proportion of online payments to 70 percent by 2030, up from the 2020 target of 28 percent.To help incentivise this growth and ensure long-term sustainability in the segment, the government has also sought to improve the regulatory framework.Related: Trump Proposes A $2 Trillion Infrastructure InterventionIn October last year the government implemented the E-commerce Law, designed to regulate digital payments and improve transparency, while on January 31 the then Ministry of Commerce and Investment - now named the Ministry of Commerce - adopted the Implementing Regulations of the E-commerce Law, adding increased oversight to areas such as personal data protection, consumer rights and disclosure obligations.Broader economic impactAside from e-commerce, the Covid-19 pandemic has had significant impacts on other parts of the Saudi economy.Above all, the outbreak of the virus has led to a significant drop in global demand for oil, which has contributed to the price falling from yearly highs of just under $69 per barrel on January 6, to $26.82 by the end of March.Given that oil was responsible for an estimated 63 percent of national revenue, according to IMF projections, the sharp fall in prices is set to place significant pressure on government budgets.\"The impact of Covid-19 - and the most recent drop in oil prices - on foreign trade will affect the Saudi balance of payments this year and beyond. The magnitude of this impact will largely depend on Saudi export oil prices,\" Hans-Peter Huber, chief investment officer of investment bank Riyad Capital, told OBG.\"On the other hand, as there are major travel restrictions in place globally, the virus will affect both inbound and outbound tourism, so the direct net impact of Covid-19 on the trade balance should be relatively small. Furthermore, the lower oil prices and virus-related lockdown should lead to lower domestic growth, which in turn has a dampening impact on import demand.\" Furthermore, the Economist Intelligence Unit has forecast that the Saudi economy will contract by 5 percent this year, down on initial predictions of 1 percent growth.By Oxford Business GroupMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "title": "Why EVs Are Greener Than Gasoline And Diesel Powered Vehicles",
        "content": "While electric vehicles are often touted as the climate-friendly green alternative to standard combustion engines, there are some people that question whether this is really the case, or if it is just a particularly egregious example of greenwashing. While the cars themselves do not emit any carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases, the production of these cars, as well as the electricity they consume, most certainly does. Do the calculations really work out in favor of EVs?No, according to some researchers. \"Electric vehicles also emit substantial amounts of CO2, the only difference being that the exhaust is released at a remove - that is, at the power plant,\" Hans-Werner Sinn wrote for the Guardian in November of last year. \"As long as coal- or gas-fired power plants are needed to ensure energy supply during the 'dark doldrums' when the wind is not blowing and the sun is not shining, EVs, like ICE vehicles, run partly on hydrocarbons. And even when they are charged with solar- or wind-generated energy, enormous amounts of fossil fuels are used to produce EV batteries in China and elsewhere, offsetting the supposed emissions reduction.\"There are some studies that support this conclusion, including a 2017 study published in the scientific journal Nature. The study, called \"Electric cars can harm the environment\" found that the environmental benefits or harms of electric vehicles varied widely by region, depending on how the energy used to charge the car was being produced, suggesting that generalizations about the greenness of EV should be used sparingly. But now, an article by Forbes directly contradicts this finding, its headline proclaiming that \"Yes, Electric Cars Are Cleaner, Even When The Power Comes From Coal.\" The article dismisses those claims \"made by those that wish to cling to the certainties of the internal combustion engine\" such as Sinn, citing a new study by the United Kingdom's Exeter and Cambridge Universities and the Netherlands' Nijmegen University. The study, in a nutshell, concludes that the use of electric vehicles results in less overall greenhouse gas emissions than conventional gasoline combustion engines in 95% of the world, the only exceptions being the most coal-dependent countries such as Poland. And this does not even take into account \"the instant improvements in local air quality from not having harmful tailpipe emissions pumping into the atmosphere.\"Related: Oil Giants Turn On Each Other As Crude Prices PlummetThe study, published in the science journal Nature Sustainability, further found that \"In countries with a heavily decarbonised system such as Sweden and France, which have large amounts of renewable and nuclear generating capacity, the average lifetime emissions from electric cars are up to 70 percent lower than petrol cars, while in the UK, which is rapidly phasing out coal but still has a reasonable amount of gas-fired power plants, emissions are around 30 percent lower,\" as paraphrased by Forbes. While most countries lag behind Europe in terms of decarbonized energy production, the world in general is trending towards a more decarbonized global economy, which means that electric vehicles will only get greener going forward. Soon, \"even inefficient electric cars will be less emission-intensive than most new petrol cars in most countries.\"The study projects these findings into that more decarbonized future, predicting that \"by 2050, half of cars on the roads could be electric, leading to a reduction in global CO2 emissions of up to 1.5 gigatons per year, which is the same as the total current CO2 emissions of Russia.\"The finding that EVs are definitively better for the environment and the climate than standard combustion engines is supported by many studies and articles. What's more, electric vehicles are simply more appropriate for the future than gasoline or diesel cars as the global economy evolves past fossil fuels.

Early in March, Russia's Energy Minister Alexander Novak said that Russia could raise its oil production by 200,000 bpd to 300,000 bpd in the short term, with a potential for up to a total increase of 500,000 bpd.But as oil prices continued to slide and demand continued to plunge, Russian companies signaled last week that boosting production might not be the wisest thing to do right now. Tatneft's CEO, Nail Maganov, who boasted weeks ago that even $8 oil is not critical for the company, told reporters last week that it might not be economically feasible for Russian firms to boost production from April, due to the coronavirus pandemic. The report of Russia putting the production boost on hold comes days after U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed on Monday to have energy officials from both countries discuss the dire state of the global oil market.On Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of Energy Dan Brouillette and Russian minister Novak \"had a productive discussion on the current volatility in global oil markets,\" the U.S. Department of Energy said.  \"Secretary Brouillette and Minister Novak discussed energy market developments and agreed to continue dialogue among major energy producers and consumers, including through the G20, to address this unprecedented period of disruption in the world economy,\" DOE said.President Trump, meanwhile, said at a news conference on Tuesday that he had phone conversations with Putin and with Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.  \"We're all going to get together and see what we can do because you're going to lose an industry over it, thousands and thousands of jobs,\" President Trump said.\"The two countries are discussing it, and I am joining at the appropriate time if need be,\" President Trump added.The Russian government official who spoke to Bloomberg on Wednesday said that Russia hasn't held talks with the Saudis on the situation on the oil market yet.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

The timing of the tenders will move forward when the uncertainty subsides.In January this year, Petrobras boasted that it had, for the first time in its history, produced more than a billion barrels of oil in 2019. and it had plans for more after it settled its dispute with the government regarding the so-called transfer-of-rights area in the pre-salt offshore zone that could contain as many as 15 billion barrels.Now, with demand for oil crushed under the coronavirus pandemic and excessive supply that is still growing, production increases are being shelved across the world's oil regions. Earlier this month, the head of the International Energy Agency, Fatih Birol, warned that oil demand could plunge by 20 million bpd because of the pandemic. This was the same figure that Vitol's chief executive gave to Bloomberg in response to a question on how much oil demand could fall by because of the outbreak. Related: Oil Hits $20 For The First Time In 18 YearsIHS Markit said last month that the world was in for the most significant decline in oil demand in the history of oil. Now, the market research company has warned that supply would need to fall by as much as 10 million bpd for any semblance of a market rebalancing to take place.\"If there is no international agreement to curtail oil production then brutal unadulterated market forces will bring the oil market into balance. The laws of supply and demand are fierce in extreme conditions,\" IHS's head of oil markets, Jim Burkhard, told World Oil.No wonder then, that Petrobras cut its production by 200,000 bpd earlier this year in response to the demand shock.

        "content": "Canada is in close contact with the United States about the oil price crash and its effect on the industry, Canada's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs Chrystia Freeland told media.\"Let me just say that this is a very fast-moving situation,\" Freeland said as quoted by CBC News. \"The current situation in the global energy markets is something that we're very concerned about.\" The oil price shock has left the Canadian oil industry reeling, with the local crude benchmark sinking below $10 per barrel, casting a shadow over the industry's survival chances yet again. What's more, the crisis could threaten the whole Canadian economy.\"With the economy already on precarious footing, the added shocks of the recent rail blockade protests, the arrival of COVID-19, and a collapse in oil prices have brought the country to the brink of recession,\" the Conference Board of Canada said in its Canadian Outlook Summary Spring 2020 this week. It added, \"The Canadian economy is reeling as the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic ravage consumer and business spending and cratering oil prices have put a halt to the expected rebound in the energy sector.\"Oil prices got a brief respite yesterday after U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted that he \"hoped and expected\" that Saudi Arabia and Russia would cut a combined 10 million bpd of oil production.\"Just spoke to my friend MBS (Crown Prince) of Saudi Arabia, who spoke with President Putin of Russia, & I expect & hope that they will be cutting back approximately 10 Million Barrels, and maybe substantially more which, if it happens, will be GREAT for the oil & gas industry!\" Trump said in the tweet that sent WTI up to more than $27 a barrel.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads from Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "As part of the Coronavirus CARES Act, the $2 trillion fiscal stimulus meant to resuscitate the US economy, Congress allocated $454 billion to help underwrite the special lending programs from the Federal Reserve. This could generate up to $4.540 trillion in new lending (assuming 10x leverage for highly-rated assets) likely geared toward small and medium-sized businesses.(Click to enlarge)It now turns out that the first industry to benefit from direct Fed loans is the imploding US energy sector, which for the past decade benefited indirectly from Fed generosity by issuing junk bonds to yield-starved investors who are now facing near-certain bankruptcy in the face, as the price of oil - if it stays at this level - assures they will never be repaid.Speaking at a White House news conference on Thursday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said energy companies squeezed by the oil-price war can turn to the Federal Reserve's lending facilities for aid but won't get direct loans from his department.\"I have very limited ability to do direct loans out of the Treasury,\" he said, suggesting that distressed shale companies should instead beg the Fed.Related: Trump Tweet Sends Oil Soaring 25%As Bloomberg notes, the $2.2 trillion coronavirus-related economic package authorizes the secretary to provide loans and grants to passenger airlines, cargo airlines, contractors and companies important to national security, Mnuchin said. Other companies must turn to the Fed, which is authorized to inject $4 trillion into the U.S. economy through various lending facilities approved by Congress.\"Our expectation is the energy companies, like all our other companies, will be able to participate in broad-based facilities, whether it's the corporate facility or whether it's the main street facility, but not direct lending out of the Treasury,\" he said, leaving the Fed as the only option.And now we look forward to the populist backlash when a line of insolvent shale CEOs forms outside the Marriner Eccles all begging to have their junk bonds taken out at par, and refinance with a Fed loan yielding, well, nothing and ideally forgivable if the new round of cheap debt manages to bankrupt Saudi Arabia as the price of oil goes negative.By Zerohedge.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "The oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia and any reported talks they may or may not be holding have become irrelevant in the context of the Covid-19 outbreak, Petrobras's chief executive Roberto Castello Blanco said.\"I sincerely think that this dispute between Russia and Saudi Arabia - although the markets reacted positively to some news about President Trump getting involved and what not - has become irrelevant amid the dimension of the (coronavirus) crisis,\" the executive said as quoted by Reuters.Those that celebrated a sharp jump in oil prices yesterday after President Trump tweeted that he expected Russia and Saudi Arabia to agree to cut a combined 10-15 million bpd in production would probably disagree. The current oil crisis has been called unprecedented by almost everyone commenting on it. But what makes it unprecedented is not the size of the price slump. It is the fact that this price slump comes amid severely dampened demand for oil. And demand for oil was crippled by the coronavirus outbreak and not by market forces of political power plays.\"Oil prices are low because global demand has gone down,\" Castello Blanco said, summing up the situation.Oil demand could plunge by as many as 20 million bpd this month as the outbreak peaks in many countries, including in the world's biggest consumer, the United States. It seems most forecasts peg the decline at about 20 million bpd. Rystad Energy said earlier this week it could even plunge by more than that: the Norwegian consultancy's forecast for April oil demand is 77.6 million bpd, down 22.8 million bpd on the year.The price rally following Trump's tweet hit a speed bump on Thursday night, but OPEC sources later confirmed that they were indeed discussing a 10 million bpd cut and were meeting on Monday, sending prices higher once again.

        "content": "Iraq saw its oil revenues cut nearly in half in March when oil prices collapsed, even though OPEC's second-largest producer exported more barrels of crude last month than it did in February.According to data from Iraq's oil ministry, cited by AFP - Agence France Presse, Iraq's crude oil sales amounted to 105 million barrels in March. For these barrels, Iraq earned a revenue of US$2.99 billion. To compare, Iraq's February sales of 98.3 million barrels of crude oil earned OPEC's producer almost twice that, at US$5.5 billion.The federal government of Iraq sold its 3.390 million bpd of oil exports at an average price of $32.73 a barrel, Iraq Oil Report quoted the oil ministry as saying.Iraq's oil typically trades at around $4 a barrel discount to Brent, so in the past couple of weeks, Iraq's crude oil was selling for $21 a barrel, Oil Minister Thamer Ghadban told local media, AFP reports.   Last week, Iraq, one of the oil producers worst hit by the oil price crash, was said to be proposing that all foreign oil firms operating in the country cut their budgets by 30 percent on the condition that crude production levels do not suffer.Iraq, which relies on oil revenues for 95 percent of its budgetary income, is one of the least diversified economies in the Middle East. Iraq was also one of the OPEC members who called for an emergency meeting of the cartel to discuss ways to support oil prices, which crumbled in March to as low as $25 a barrel Brent. Iraq may see its wish granted soon after U.S. President Donald Trump intervened in the oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia and discussed the oil market with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and with Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"The Kingdom calls for an urgent meeting for OPEC+ states and another group of countries, with aim of reaching a fair solution to restore a desire balance of the oil markets,\" Saudi Arabia said on Thursday, via its official Saudi Press Agency, while President Trump said that he expects and hopes the Saudis and Russia to cut back \"approximately 10 Million Barrels, and maybe substantially more.\"  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

Saudi Arabia has previously reported that it has increased its oil production to more than 12 million bpd.The extra barrels on the market coincided with the Covid-19 pandemic, which destroyed global oil demand, pushing down oil prices to levels not seen in years.Oil prices were trading up more than 20% on Thursday afternoon following the positive oil market developments, with WTI crude trading at $24.80 (+$4.49), and Brent crude trading at $30.02 ($5.28). Oil prices had been up even more immediately following President Trump's tweet, but prices have since fallen back somewhat.Several analysts have suggested that any OPEC action would be too little, too late, with demand unlikely to snap back anytime soon due to the pandemic. A 10 million bpd cut, however, would go a long way to stabilizing the oil market.The Saudi Press Agency earlier on Thursday confirmed that it had called an urgent meeting for OPEC+ and other states to discuss the oil markets and the coronavirus response.

        "content": "The government in Kazakhstan has, in the light of the unfolding coronavirus pandemic and the concomitant fall in global oil prices, revised its economic projections for this year to forecast a 0.9 percent contraction.Before the current crisis hit, gross domestic product, or GDP, had been expected to expand by 4 percent.National Economy Minister Ruslan Dalenov said on April 2 that the value of Kazakhstan's exports has been especially badly hit.\"Exports will drop by $16.3 billion to $35.1 billion. Imports will decline by $7.5 billion to $26.6 billion,\" he said. \"(Anticipated) nominal GDP is estimated at 69.7 trillion tenge ($155 billion), which is 4.8 trillion tenge ($10.6 billion) lower than the earlier forecast.\"Dalenov pointed to the confluence of negative global factors as the main contribution to the slowdown. The government's radical measures to halt coronavirus in its tracks have brought vast swathes of the economy to a standstill.The fall in the value of Kazakhstan's most valuable commodities has been precipitous. By the government's own estimates, the value of its oil exports has collapsed by 65.7 percent since the start of the year, and the average price for metals has fallen by 15.6 percent.\"Bearing that in mind, the average (assumed) price for oil in April-December this year has been set at $20 per barrel. The estimated dollar rate is 440 tenge and annual inflation will be in the range of 9-11 percent,\" Dalenov said.This is a dramatic change from the assumptions underlying earlier budget plans, which saw oil at $55 per barrel, the tenge at 380 to the dollar and inflation targeted at 4-6 percent.Forecasts on oil production are being trimmed too. Output is now set at 86 million tons, down by 4 million tons. Large slumps are anticipated in the mining, manufacturing, agriculture, construction and service industries, as well as in trade. Speaking at a press conference on April, First Deputy Finance Minister Berik Sholpankulov said that the government intends to raise 2.4 trillion tenge ($5.3 billion) in debt to paper over its budget deficit. About $3 billion will be raised on the international debt market, he said.Kazakhstan is loosening its purse strings to minimize the broader social impact of the crisis. On March 31, President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev announced more details of a package intended to bolster support for welfare recipients and help business weather the storm. Sholpankulov said 5.9 trillion tenge ($13 billion) were being earmarked for that purpose.Related: World's Largest Oil Trader Says Demand Could Plummet By 20 Million BpdThe scale of the economic slump, which will, if the government's own projections are accurate, outdo even the 2008-2009 crash in gravity, is forcing Nur-Sultan to dig deep into its pockets. One important source of relief is the rainy-day National Fund, which will be central to the government's plan to spend its way out of trouble.Those reserves are currently worth around $60 billion. Reuters news agency has reported that the government intends to use up 4.8 trillion tenge ($10.6 billion at current rates) from that pot this year, up from the 2.7 trillion tenge ($6 billion) it intended to use previously.Economist Meruert Makhmutova wrote on Facebook that the recurrent need to raid the piggybank is forcing the government to learn some hard lessons.\"In 2015-2016 (when oil prices were low), Kazakhstan spent twice as much (out of the National Fund) as it earned from oil. This year, that difference between revenues and spending from (fund reserves) will evidently be threefold. We will have to learn to live without oil.\"By Eurasianet.orgMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "The world has seen some oil shocks before, but \"none has hit the industry with quite the ferocity we are witnessing today,\" the IEA said on Wednesday in an article on its website, referring to the effects of the coronavirus crisis that have caused oil prices to crumble.\"The impacts will be felt throughout oil's global supply chains and ripple into other parts of the energy sector,\" the IEA said.While focusing on the coronavirus, the IEA also mentions the supply shock, which it tactfully blames on the \"end of restraints on production from OPEC producers and Russia (OPEC+),\" stopping short of singling out a few OPEC producers that have promised to purposefully flood the market with millions of extra barrels of oil per day, such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the UAE.The reason the shock is unique this time around, the IAE says, is because one of the usual stabilization factors, consumers, is not able to do its part. As billions of people around the world still in lockdown, consumers are unable to react to falling prices like they usually do--by consuming more. So for as long as the pandemic lasts, boosts in demand that were seen during other oil shocks are \"highly unlikely.\"\"Instead, a rapid buildup of oil stocks is starting to saturate available storage capacity, pushing down prices further,\" the IEA said.The IAE also outlined five key dimensions to the current crisis, which it promises to detail further in its upcoming Oil Market Report that will be forthcoming in a couple of weeks. Those five elements are current production grinding to a halt, \"sharp\" cuts to new investments all the way down the supply chain, pressure on refiners, \"massive\" strains on fossil-fuel-revenue-dependent countries, and low oil prices spilling over into the rest of the energy sector such as natural gas.The IEA said that comparing the current shock to previous oil market disruptions \"are inevitable but misplaced,\" adding that we have \"never seen anything like 2020.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "The slowdown in China's electric vehicle sector could have knock-on effects on the battery metals market in both the short and long run, commodities analysts at Argus Media said in a new report.A weaker economy and lower new energy vehicle (NEV) subsidies that were introduced in 2019 led to a drop in Chinese vehicle production and sales last year.Overall, China produced 1.24 million NEVs during the year, down 2.3 percent from the 1.27 million produced in 2018, and significantly lower than the initial production target of 1.5 million NEVs. The country sold 1.21 million NEVs last year, a 4 percent drop from 1.26 million in 2018, Argus.China currently represents almost 60 percent of global electric vehicle (EV) sales, according to data compiled by Argus, and a weaker industry in China has disproportionate effects on the global market.The coronavirus outbreak has put further downward pressure on the sector at the start of 2020 and is expected to continue to weigh on China's NEV market, with domestic production and sales forecast to fall in the first quarter.Buying interest for NEVs is expected to weaken significantly in the short term as potential buyers have opted to stay at home to prevent infections, Argus analysts predicted.In January, China produced only 40,000 NEVs, down by 55 percent from a year earlier and by 74 percent from 149,000 units in December 2019. January sales were 44,000, down by 54 percent from a year earlier and by 73 percent from 163,000 in December.

Several manufacturers including the 40,000 units/yr NIO, 150,000 units/yr Xiaopeng and 300,000 units/yr Lixiang plants have postponed deliveries.(Click to enlarge)The slowdown in China would also hinder the prospects for global growth, given the country's lead in EV production and dominance in the global marketplace. Initial forecasts for global EV sales of over 2.5 million units for 2019 (a rise of over 25 percent) already proved to be over-optimistic, and predictions for sales in 2020 will have to be revised accordingly, said Argus.Originally, Argus had forecasted global EV sales of almost 3.2 million units for 2020: 1.95 million in China and 1.24 million in the rest of the world. However, the firm expects China to struggle to match its EV sales in 2019 with the fraught start to the year, while sales in the rest of the world are unlikely to make up the shortfall.As a result, Argus is now forecasting global EV sales of just under 2.1 million units in 2020, a 1.4 percent drop from 2019.The knock-on effect of this hiccup in the EV growth story is that the longer term forecast for EV sales could be over 20 percent lower by 2030 than originally estimated, or as many as 5 million units lower in absolute terms, Argus analysts estimated.By Mining.com More Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

According to OPEC's February MOMR, Brazil's production was expected to grow by 310,000 bpd in 2020.Brazil's oil production topped 3 million barrels per day in November 2019, according to Brazil's National Petroleum Agency, with total oil and gas production reaching 3.95 million bpd.Norway, too, is planning on attending the G20 meeting.If Brazil and Norway agree to get onboard the OPEC+ train with production cuts, it would add to the market-controlling power that the group has.That's if the group can reach a consensus.Multiple TASS sources suggested on Monday afternoon that the group may have had trouble agreeing on individual volumes for the cuts, leading to the group pushing the meeting back to Thursday.  One of the sources suggested that it was Russia and Saudi Arabia--the two largest producers of the production cut deal that ended April 1--who could not reach an agreement.The group is still eager to get the United States on board any production cuts in order to give the group more weight to pull up oil prices, although President Trump has said in daily briefings that the issue of the US participation in any production cuts has not been promised.WTI had slipped 7.45% on Monday afternoon to $26.23 at 3.23 PM CT.

President Putin and Russia as a whole are inclined to take part in a constructive negotiation process -which doesn't have alternative right now - to stabilize the international energy market, Peskov added.Saudi Arabia, Russia, and many other oil producers were set to video-meet on Monday to discuss ways of supporting collapsing oil prices by potentially cutting 10 million bpd, or even 15 million bpd, of global oil production.Over the weekend, however, Saudi Arabia and Russia traded accusations, claiming that the other was the reason the OPEC+ pact collapsed last month, widening the rift between the two former allies and leading to a postponement of the Monday meeting to Thursday, April 9.Putin said last week that Saudi Arabia's oil price war and its readiness to offer steep discounts for its oil targeted to bankrupt U.S. shale. Saudi Arabia responded to that by accusing Russia of breaking up the OPEC+ coalition last month.The words attributed to Putin by media are \"fully devoid of truth,\" Saudi Minister of Foreign Affairs, Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud, said in a statement late on Friday.\"The withdrawal of the kingdom from the agreement is not correct, but that Russia was the one that refused the agreement, while the Kingdom and 22 other countries were trying to persuade Russia to make further cuts and extend the agreement, yet Russia has not agreed,\" the official Saudi Press Agency quoted the Saudi foreign minister as saying.Meanwhile, both Saudi Arabia and Russia signal that while they are ready to talk potential production cuts, they would consider doing so only if major producers from outside the OPEC+ format, including the United States, join such cuts.

This shutdown has since been extended to internal flights and will last until at least April 15. Additionally, on March 25 the government announced a two-week curfew from 7pm to 6am, while pharmacies and food shops will be the only retail establishments allowed to open on weekends and past 5pm on weekdays. Restaurants may only open for deliveries.Pre-emptive economic stimulusAs the potential economic fallout of the pandemic began to become clear, on March 22 President Abdel Fattah El Sisi announced a comprehensive LE100bn ($6.4bn) package of measures. This included a LE22bn ($1.4bn) stimulus to support the Egyptian Exchange, which should also benefit from a 50% reduction in taxes on the dividends of listed companies.In addition, the Central Bank of Egypt announced a 3% interest rate cut in what it described as a \"pre-emptive move\" to support the wider economy.The outbreak will have a considerable negative impact on one Egypt's most important industries, tourism. The sector accounted for around 12% of GDP in 2019, with tourism receipts standing at $16.4bn and arrival numbers registering a record 57.5% increase.Related: China's Plan To Capitalize On The Oil Price WarIn a further bid to mitigate the impact of Covid-19 restrictions on key sectors, the government has committed to support exporters by allocating LE1bn ($63.5m) for export subsidies during March and April, and will furthermore postpone tax payments for three months on facilities and properties occupied by tourism companies.Energy prices cutFollowing the country's IMF-backed reforms beginning in 2016, energy subsidies have been gradually removed, resulting in a projected price rise for both households and businesses into 2020.However, in a bid to offset the impact of the pandemic on industrial output, on March 17 the government announced that the price of gas for industrial providers would be reduced from $5.50 to $4.50 per 1m British thermal units.As part of the same package of measures, the government also announced that the price of electricity would be reduced for heavy industry consumption, from LE1.10 ($0.07) to LE0.10 ($0.006) per KWh. For other industries, the price is to be kept stable for between three and five years.Boosting solar capacityAgainst the current backdrop of challenging economic circumstances, on April 1 it was announced that the World Bank's Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) would provide funding for six new solar power plants at Benban Solar Park in the Aswan Governorate in Upper Egypt, one of the largest such installations in Africa.The total investment of $52.35m will be issued in the form of guarantees to Norwegian-headquartered photovoltaics firm Scatec Solar, and will be used for the operation and maintenance of the six new plants.Related: Demand Destruction Will Decimate Oil PricesThe amount is guaranteed against the risk of currency inconvertibility and transfer restriction for up to 15 years. It is part of Egypt's solar feed-in-tariff programme, which provides long-term contracts to private energy companies with a view to generating investment in renewable sources.       \"In the face of uncertainty arising from the Covid-19 pandemic, MIGA remains committed to helping drive foreign direct investment (FDI) by supporting investors who are helping Egypt achieve its long-term goals of diversifying its energy mix,\" Hiroshi Matano, executive vice-president of MIGA, said in a statement.While the pandemic has caused a number of delays for the renewables segment, notably the postponement of the construction of four solar plants by domestic firm Inter Solar Egypt, the future bodes well for the expansion of the industry.\"In the current uncertain economic environment, solar energy has become popular, as it can be produced up to 80% more cheaply than other sources,\" Yaseen Abdel-Ghaffar, Managing Director of SolarizEgypt and board member of The Solar Company, told OBG. \"Although it was initially difficult to secure FDI for projects, banks are becoming increasingly receptive to renewables and a growth in financing is expected after regular economic conditions are re-established.\"By Oxford Business GroupMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "title": "Norway Might Join Output Cuts If Major Producers Reach A Deal",
        "content": "Norway could discuss reducing its oil production if the world's major producers reach a deal on significantly cutting global oil production, Tina Bru, Minister for Petroleum and Energy of Western Europe's biggest oil producer, told Reuters over the weekend.    \"If a broad group of producers agree to cut production significantly, Norway will consider a unilateral cut if it supports our resource management and our economy,\" Bru told Reuters via email on Saturday.This week, a broad group of producers are expected to discuss a global cut in oil production to try to prevent the glut from overwhelming storage within weeks and to prop up oil prices so low that no one's happy with them. Analysts remain skeptical that a major coalition of producers, including the United States, will agree to enforce significant production cuts in the range of 10 million bpd-15 million bpd, as touted by U.S. President Donald Trump.  While all producers signal willingness to participate in talks, no one is willing to cut unless everyone else--including the U.S.--agrees to take part in those cuts.Norway, for its part, is not a member of either OPEC or the extended OPEC+ format, which collapsed last month but is set to be revived at least in the form of talks expected later this week.While Norway had cut its production in the 1990s and early 2000s when prices were low, it hasn't done so as part of any deal with OPEC or other producers.Right now, Norway by itself cannot do anything to help the severely imbalanced market, Reuters quoted Bru as saying to private Norwegian broadcaster TV2 last week.\"We're still producing profitably at today's oil price and nothing indicates that we'll end up in a situation where we'd have to cut output,\" the minister said last week.Some Norwegian oilfields would turn in profits even at $10 oil, the Norwegian minister told the television broadcaster.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Several rockets were fired and landed on Monday near a residential district in southern Iraq, where many foreign oil firms have their headquarters and where oil workers live, without causing damage or injuring people, sources with the police and oil firms told Reuters.The oil district near Iraq's major city of Basra was largely empty because many foreign oil companies had evacuated their personnel due to the coronavirus pandemic. An employee at Halliburton in the area told Reuters that the rockets landed far from the site.Rocket fire is not uncommon in Iraq, where the U.S. embassy in Baghdad has been targeted a few times this year, by what the U.S. attributed to Iran-backed paramilitary factions.The rocket fire of three Katyusha rockets on Monday did not disrupt oil production or exports from Basra, Iraq's key outlet of oil in the south, officials with Iraqi state firm Basra Oil Co told Reuters.The rockets may not affect Iraq's oil exports, but the crash in oil prices has significantly cut Iraq's main government revenue source--oil income.Iraq saw its oil revenues cut nearly in half in March when oil prices collapsed, even though OPEC's second-largest producer exported more barrels of crude last month than it did in February.According to data from Iraq's oil ministry, cited by AFP - Agence France Presse, Iraq's crude oil sales amounted to 105 million barrels in March. For these barrels, Iraq earned a revenue of US$2.99 billion. To compare, Iraq's February sales of 98.3 million barrels of crude oil earned OPEC's producer almost twice that, at US$5.5 billion.Last month, Iraq, one of the oil producers worst hit by the oil price crash, was said to be proposing that all foreign oil firms operating in the country cut their budgets by 30 percent on the condition that crude production levels do not suffer.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Oil prices took another nosedive today after during the weekend Russia and Saudi Arabia postponed a meeting scheduled for Monday as they went at each other's throats trading blame for the price collapse.CNN reported, citing an OPEC source, that the meeting was rescheduled for Thursday. The Financial Times reported that Norway and Alberta would be joining the meeting.Earlier today, CNBC quoted the head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund Kiril Dmitriev as saying that Russia and Saudi Arabia were \"very, very close to a deal\".The spike in hostility between Riyadh and Moscow did not bode well for the outcome of the meeting although the price situation is serious enough to motivate overlooking the differences the two might have regarding whose fault the crisis is, as the CNBC report suggests. However, a Bloomberg report from last week has indicated Russia would only agree to cuts if the United States cuts, too. This might make an agreement tricky as the U.S. has not signaled any readiness to join any cuts.Producers, meanwhile, are struggling to cope. Algeria's energy minister said yesterday all oil producers should agree to reduce their production and implement it immediately.The situation in oil is unprecedented as the coronavirus outbreak, which has so far infected more than 1 million people globally has crippled demand to such an extent that some experts are warning of a looming storage capacity shortage that would push prices even lower.Related: Big Oil Raises Debt To Ride Out Price CrashAccording to Vitol's Russell Hardy and IHS Markit's Daniel Yergin, the effect of the outbreak on oil demand would be about 20 million bpd during the peak of the crisis. The International Energy Agency's Fatih Birol agrees and is even more pessimistic: he said, as quoted by Reuters, that the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on oil demand could reach a quarter of the average daily, which is close to 100 million bpd.At the time of writing, Brent crude was trading at $33.46 a barrel, with West Texas Intermediate at $27.33, both down from Friday's close, WTI by more than 3 percent and Brent crude by close to 2 percent, but both still higher than the troughs seen earlier this month, before President Trump's tweet.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Even if the OPEC+ group and other major oil producers in the world were to agree to deep production cuts, they would be unable to prevent what is sure to be an enormous global inventory build this quarter due to unprecedented demand destruction, Fatih Birol, Executive Director of the International Energy Agency (IEA), told Reuters on Friday.The measures many countries have taken to try to flatten the curve of the coronavirus pandemic are destroying unprecedented volumes of oil demand as more than 3 billion people--from India to Europe to the United States--remain in lockdown.As a result of restricted commuter travel, grounded flights, and economic slowdown, demand for oil in April is expected to drop by 20 million bpd year on year, and probably more.Even if OPEC+ plus other producers were to discuss, agree to, and implement a collective cut of 10 million bpd, global oil inventories would still rise by 15 million bpd in the second quarter, the IEA's chief told Reuters.  Earlier this week, the IEA said that the world has seen some oil shocks before, but \"none has hit the industry with quite the ferocity we are witnessing today.\"The reason the shock is unique this time around, the IAE says, is because one of the usual stabilization factors, consumers, is unable to do its part. As billions of people around the world are still in lockdown, consumers are unable to react to falling prices like they usually do--by consuming more. So for as long as the pandemic lasts, boosts in demand that were seen during other oil shocks are \"highly unlikely.\"Meanwhile, producers from the OPEC+ group and from another group are expected to discuss potential ways to react to the massive demand loss and the low oil prices that hit their lowest level in 18 years earlier this week.While U.S. President Donald Trump touted a cut of 10 million bpd, and possibly 15 million bpd, many oil analysts, cited by Reuters, remain highly skeptical that an agreement of these proportions could be reached and implemented.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

Russian oil firms, who did not increase production this month as promised weeks ago when the OPEC+ deal collapsed, have signaled a readiness for global coordinated action to stop the price crash, as the demand destruction during the lockdowns from India to the U.S. turned out much more than initially thought, according to Bloomberg's sources.   Four sources at Russian oil firms told Bloomberg that they could be ready to agree to some kind of a three-way deal among Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the United States.  Two weeks ago, Russia was dismissing all calls for and reports about returning to the negotiating table, confident that it would outlast Saudi Arabia in the oil price war.However, the global oil demand outlook has become more and more pessimistic by the day, with some analysts expecting the demand loss in April at 30 million bpd - nearly a third of the world's typical consumption of oil.Russia's President Vladimir Putin is slated to hold a video call with oil executives from the local firms later on Friday to discuss the \"unfavorable\" situation in the oil market, Putin's press secretary Dmitry Peskov said today.Related: Goldman Sachs: Prepare For A Massive Oil Demand ShockOn Thursday, Peskov told reporters that no one had launched any talks about a potential new oil-production deal to replace the OPEC+ format, but noted that \"no one is happy\" with the current oil price.  The current prices of Brent Crude are well below Saudi Arabia's fiscal break-even price of $80 a barrel oil, below the break-evens of nearly all U.S. shale production, and below the Russian breakeven price, too.  Shortly after Kremlin's spokesman said no talks were being held, U.S. President Donald Trump said that he hoped and expected that Saudi Arabia and Russia would \"cut back approximately 10 Million Barrels, and maybe substantially more,\" while OPEC's top producer and de facto leader Saudi Arabia called for an emergency meeting of OPEC+ and \"another group of countries\" to try to find \"a fair solution\" to the current market imbalance. The video meeting will be held on Monday, and the U.S. oil regulator will also be invited to take part in the discussions.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

Also on Friday, Birol said that he had held a call with Saudi Arabia's Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, during which the two \"shared our concerns over the situation in global oil markets.\"\"I conveyed my hope that at this critical juncture, Saudi Arabia can once again play a stabilising role, via its G20 Presidency,\" Birol tweeted on Friday, a day after Saudi Arabia called for an emergency meeting of OPEC+ producers and an additional group of producers to seek solutions to the price crash and the growing global glut.The video meeting is set for Monday, April 6, and the U.S. oil regulator is also expected to be invited to the talks, which will reportedly include discussion of a massive global production cut of 10 million bpd.Earlier this week, the IEA said that the world has seen some oil shocks before, but \"none has hit the industry with quite the ferocity we are witnessing today.\"\"The impacts will be felt throughout oil's global supply chains and ripple into other parts of the energy sector,\" the IEA said on Wednesday. According to the Paris-based agency, some production will grind to a halt, investment cuts will hit the industry, refiners will also come under immense pressure, and there will be a considerable strain in some oil-exporting nations. In addition, the price collapse and the demand collapse will impact the broader energy sector, the global economy, and trade.  \"Comparisons with previous periods of disruption in oil markets are inevitable but misplaced.

And even though many producers in the U.S. oil patch have hedged their output for this year at higher rates, they are seeking to minimize the impact of the oil price crash on their operations. Rystad Energy reported earlier this year that 30 companies accounting for 38 percent of total U.S. production this year had hedged their output at an average price floor of $56 a barrel. But they are cutting costs.As in the last crisis, oilfield service providers will likely be harder hit than exploration and production players. Already at least two companies have asked for deep discounts on these services, of about 25 percent, to weather the crisis. At the same time, they are cutting spending, meaning that production growth is about to slow down soon, and so is hiring.The last industry downturn caused by low prices cost the U.S. oil industry--including oilfield services--as many as 200,000 jobs. That was about a third of the total workforce employed in the sector. Now, the U.S. oil industry could be looking at a rerun--potentially a worse one--because unlike last time, this time the excessive production of oil is adding to a slump in demand caused by the spread of Covid-19 that has put most of Asia, Europe, and North America on lockdown.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

Suncor Energy is issuing US$889 million (C$1.25 billion) of ten-year notes with a coupon of 5.00% that have been priced at $99.697 per $100 of notes to yield 5.039%.   As per Bloomberg estimates, Suncor Energy paid 420 basis points over similar Canadian government securities in this issue--triple the premium that the company had offered to investors when it issued similar 10-year notes in May last year.   With prices crashing, and the price of Western Canadian Select (WCS) now below US$10 per barrel, investors are demanding higher premiums over Canadian Treasuries from Canada's energy corporate debt issuers to hold their notes.Suncor is still investment-grade rated at rating agencies, and this may have been one of the reasons why its latest bond received orders three times the issued amount, Bloomberg quoted sources with knowledge of the matter as saying.Moody's assigned on Tuesday a Baa1 rating to Suncor Energy's notes offering, saying that \"Suncor's liquidity is good\" and that \"should oil prices remain low, Suncor will take necessary actions to maintain its capital structure, cash flow and liquidity, and reduce negative free cash flow.\"Suncor plans to use the proceeds from the notes to repay short-term debt and for general corporate purposes.Like many other Canadian oil firms, last month Suncor revised down its capital guidance by 26 percent in response to the crashing oil prices.Over the past two weeks, Suncor has increased its liquidity by US$2.7 billion (C$3.75 billion), and this \"financial flexibility ensures the company will have access to adequate financial resources should it be required,\" it said.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

Kevin Cramer and Alaska's Dan Sullivan will be talking to the Saudis two days after an expanded OPEC+ meeting that many expect to result in a new production cut agreement, this time involving more producing nations. The U.S., however, has clearly signaled it would not be willing to join any cuts despite equally clear signals from Saudi Arabia and Russia that its participation is a prerequisite for an agreement.Although last month a member of the Texas railroad commission--the oil state's energy industry regulator--floated the idea of state-imposed production cuts, the official federal policy line is that the free market will take care of production. However, it seems Washington is relying on free-market mechanisms helped by OPEC+ action, which is in direct opposition to free-market principles.Details about the scheduled call between Cramer and Sullivan and the Saudi officials remain undisclosed. According to analytic firm ClearView Energy Partners, however, the conversation will most likely come down to a repeat of the threat of withdrawing U.S. troops and military equipment from the Kingdom unless the Saudis agree to reduce their production--another questionable move from a free-market perspective.OPEC and Russia are scheduled to meet on Thursday to discuss prices and production.

The price of a Brent barrel was also trading down on Tuesday, by $0.70 (-2.12%), at $32.35--up by roughly $6 week on week.

This week's build compares to analyst expectations for a 4.333-million-barrel build for the week.Distillate inventories were down, by 177,000 barrels for the week, compared to last week's 4.458-million-barrel draw, while Cushing inventories saw a large gain of 6.804 million barrels.US crude oil production as estimated by the Energy Information Administration showed that production for the week ending March 27 was unchanged at 13.0 million bpd.At 4:36 pm EDT, WTI was trading at $24.05 while Brent was trading at $32.04.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

While major international oil firms are slashing capital expenditures and production guidance due to the unsustainabiy low oil prices, the national oil and gas company of Indonesia is not changing its target to boost total production to 923,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), Pertamina's executive said.Despite the financial pressure stemming from the oil price collapse, the company will aim to reach its previously set production targets, Dharmawan noted.It's not clear how Pertamina's intention to stick to its plan to raise production would dovetail with plans of the world's major oil-producing nations to discuss a massive global production cut to help save oil prices from crashing further amid cratering demand.On Monday, Pertamina said that its oil and gas production in the first quarter of the year hit 99 percent of the target. Crude oil production stood at 421,000 barrels per day (bpd) and natural gas production was 2,887 million cubic feet per day (mmscfd) in Q1, the company said.According to estimates from Rystad Energy from February, Indonesia's oil and gas production will most likely decline this year and will not hit the government's official estimate of achieving 8-percent growth in 2020 compared to 2019.  \"Out of the eight fields starting up in 2020, only Malacca Strait Phase 1 is an oil play and will not on its own replace the declining production from Indonesia's mature fields.

According to Refinitiv's ship-tracking data cited by Reuters, four tankers that have loaded LNG at U.S. LNG export facilities are planning to dock in China, where life has started to gradually return to normality, and industrial activity and demand have slowly started to recover.A cargo from the Cameron LNG facility in Louisiana, two ships fromSabine Pass, Louisiana, and one cargo out of Corpus Christi, Texas, are expected to reach China late in April or in early May, according to Refinitiv's ship-tracking data.Those LNG cargoes would be the first U.S. shipments of LNG to China in more than a year, after the trade war last year and the steep 25-percent Chinese tariff on imports of U.S. LNG had basically stalled energy trade between the world's two biggest economies.The U.S. and China signed a Phase One trade deal in the middle of January, with China promising to buy an additional US$52.4 billion worth of U.S. energy products in 2020 and 2021 on top of the 2017 levels. Despite the deal, China kept the 25-percent tariff on LNG imports from the U.S., and analysts largely concurred that given the tariff, unless political will in China dictates otherwise, the Chinese will not achieve the target to buy energy products.But then came the coronavirus, sweeping through China first, and upending every analyst forecast for any deal or event this year.Earlier this year, Rystad Energy estimated that China's LNG imports from the U.S. would restart \"only once the tariffs are lifted or if political support is offered by the Chinese government.\"China has begun granting tax waivers to exempt some of its LNG importers from the tariffs, three sources based in China with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Petrobras has set its April oil production at 2.07 million barrels per day (bpd), after having reduced production by 200,000 bpd in the past two weeks in response to the low oil prices, Brazil's state-owned oil firm said in a securities filing on Tuesday.  \"The company continues monitoring the market and, if necessary, will make new adjustments always ensuring safety conditions for people, operations and processes,\" said Petrobras, the largest producer in the South American country, which not part of the OPEC+ group.At the end of March, Petrobras--like many major oil firms--announced reductions in capital spending and production guidance due to the oil price crash and the collapse in global oil demand in the coronavirus pandemic.Petrobras slashed its planned investments for 2020 to US$8.5 billion from US$12 billion and mothballed operating platforms in the shallow-water fields with higher lifting costs per barrel that had turned cash-flow negative after the price collapse. On March 26, Petrobras said it would cut its oil production by 100,000 bpd by the end of March. A week later, Petrobras said it would cut its oil production by 200,000 bpd as of April 1--a volume that includes the production reduction announced the previous week.  Premium: Ending The Oil War Isn't EnoughProduction levels at Petrobras, being a state-controlled entity, could play an important role in global oil supply management in the coming months, if Brazil and other nations outside the current OPEC+ group, most notably the United States, Canada, and Norway, were to join OPEC+ and its leaders Saudi Arabia and Russia in a global production-cut deal to possibly remove 10 million bpd from the market.Brazil was expected to be the third-largest growth driver of non-OPEC supply in 2020 after the U.S. and Norway, according to OPEC.Last week, Petrobras's chief executive Roberto Castello Blanco said that the oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia and any reported talks they may or may not be holding had become irrelevant in the context of the demand loss in the Covid-19 pandemic.   Analysts are still skeptical that such a large and diverse group of oil producers will agree and implement a collective cut, especially as every country signals they would not reduce their production if the United States doesn't commit to cuts, too.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "ExxonMobil is axing capital expenditure for this year by $10 billion, quantifying on Tuesday the capex cuts it announced last month in response to the oil demand and oil price collapse. The most significant reductions will take place in the Permian Basin. Shortly after the price of oil collapsed in early March, Exxon said that it was looking to \"significantly reduce spending as a result of market conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and commodity price decreases.\"On Tuesday, the U.S. supermajor quantified this 'significant reduction,' saying that its capital investments for 2020 are now expected to be 30 percent lower, at around $23 billion, down from the previously announced capex of some $33 billion.Exxon will also cut its cash operating expenses by 15 percent, driven by deliberate actions to increase efficiencies and reduce costs.\"The largest share of the capital spending reduction will be in the Permian Basin, where short-cycle investments can be more readily adjusted to respond to market conditions while preserving value over the long term. Reduced activity will affect the pace of drilling and well completions until market conditions improve,\" Exxon said, echoing the strategy of the other U.S. supermajor, Chevron.Two weeks ago, Chevron said it was slashing capital expenditures, especially in the Permian, and was suspending its share buyback program. Chevron is axing its 2020 capital spending plan by $4 billion, or by 20 percent, to $16 billion, to protect its dividend and balance sheet in one of the worst oil price routs in recent memory. Of the $4-billion capex cut, Chevron will slash $2 billion across upstream unconventionals, primarily in the Permian Basin.Premium: Ending The Oil War Isn't EnoughExxon now followed Chevron is slashing capex in the basin, which was their prime target for boosting production in the coming years. All supermajors have announced spending reductions in recent weeks after oil prices crashed on the coronavirus-hit demand shock and price-war-driven supply shock.  The Permian and oil development offshore Guyana remain part of Exxon's long-term growth plans, but the supermajor has delayed a final investment decision for the Rovuma liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Mozambique, which was expected later this year.\"Our capital allocation priorities also remain unchanged. Our objective is to continue investing in industry-advantaged projects to create value, preserve cash for the dividend and make appropriate and prudent use of our balance sheet,\" Exxon's chairman and CEO Darren Woods said.Unlike its competitors, Exxon has pursued higher spending in recent years to boost production, but it has also amassed higher debt along the way.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

However, conditions that have typically formed the backdrop to such rating actions in the past are clearly coalescing again,\" Fitch Ratings said.Just last week, Fitch downgraded Gabon, a small OPEC producer, in a multi-notch downgrade action, slashing the rating to 'CCC' from 'B', to reflect the rating agency's view that \"risks to Gabon's sovereign debt repayment capacity have risen significantly due to liquidity pressure from the fall in oil prices.\"According to the rating agency, \"[t]he most common rating category from which multi-notch downgrades have occurred is 'B', confirming weaker sovereigns are more prone to crises.\"On Monday, Fitch downgraded Africa's top oil producer and an OPEC member, Nigeria, by one notch to 'B' from 'B+, with a \"negative\" outlook, reflecting the strain on Nigeria's external finances from the oil price crash and the pandemic shock.Last month, Fitch slashed its short- and medium-term oil price assumptions, expecting a record glut in 2020. Fitch slashed its average base-case 2020 price assumption for Brent Crude to $41 a barrel from $62.50, and WTI Crude to $38 per barrel this year, down from an earlier assumption of $57.50.Last week, the rating agency slashed its oil price forecasts again, expecting Brent Crude to average $35 a barrel this year and WTI Crude to average $32 a barrel.Although there is some political will to discuss ways of propping up oil prices, the ability of Saudi Arabia and Russia \"to support or raise prices in the very short term could be limited given rapidly declining demand,\" Fitch said last Thursday, just before U.S. President Donald Trump dropped the first hint that oil superpowers could be debating a massive global collective oil production cut.

        "content": "An oil export terminal blockade that led to the shut down of fields and refineries has so far cost Libya close to $4 billion, the National Oil Corporation said in a statement this week, adding that production was now down to below 100,000 bpd, at 89,993 bpd as of Sunday.\"NOC calls on all parties within Libya to lift the blockade and re-start oil and gas production, so every Libyan can benefit from a stronger economy and a more steady supply of fuels,\" the statement read.Unfortunately, this could not have come at a worse time. The rest of OPEC and even non-OPEC producers such as Norway and Canada are considering oil production cuts in response to the oil price plunge that followed Saudi Arabia's announcement of plans in early March to turn the taps on and up supply to 12.3 million bpd from this month.A group of paramilitary formations affiliated with General Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Army occupied the export terminals in mid-January along with pipelines and fields. The blockade came amid continued fighting between the LNA, which is loyal to the eastern Libyan government and the forces loyal to the Government of National Accord, which is recognized by the United Nations.Since then, the blockade has cost Libya 1.13 million bpd in lost oil production, adding up to a cumulative 83 million barrels and financial losses of $16.586 million daily, according to data from the National Oil Corporation.Meanwhile, the fighting continues despite numerous calls for a ceasefire, including a \"global ceasefire\" amid the Covid-19 pandemic. All attempts at instituting a truce, even for 24 hours, have so far failed as LNA's Haftar seeks control of the whole of Libya, and the GNA continues to protect its positions. Other countries have also joined the conflict, with Turkey sending troops to help the GNA and Emirati forces fighting on the side of the LNA.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Production declines across the U.S. shale patch as companies reduce drilling and spending cannot be viewed as a voluntary U.S. cut aimed at supporting oil prices, Vladimir Putin's Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday.The comments suggest that Russia may insist on a collective cut from the United States when major oil producers sit down to discuss a global production reduction later this week.\"These are totally different types of cuts,\" Peskov told reporters in Moscow on Wednesday, as carried by Russian news agency RIA Novosti.  \"You compare total reduction in demand with cuts aimed at stabilizing the global markets. It's like comparing apples and oranges. There is a difference,\" the Kremlin spokesman said. Asked whether the natural decline in U.S. oil production can be viewed as the U.S. participating in a deal to stabilize markets and prices, Peskov told reporters to wait for the upcoming talks--\"let's wait until tomorrow and the day after tomorrow,\" he said.OPEC, Russia, and producers outside of the OPEC+ format are poised to discuss the possibility of a massive collective global cut, potentially of 10 million bpd, in a video conference on Thursday.Earlier this week, U.S. President Donald Trump said that he believes American oil production output cuts would happen automatically thanks to the nature of the free market.OPEC hasn't asked President Trump to find a way to ask U.S. oil companies to collectively cut production, the President said on Monday.  \"I think it's happening automatically, but nobody's asked me that question yet, so we'll see what happens,\" President Trump said at a press briefing, referring to U.S. oil production. Russia, as well as OPEC's leader Saudi Arabia, are signaling that they are ready to talk but are pointing out that any massive cut, 10 million bpd-15 million bpd, as touted by President Trump, should involve the United States, too.

        "content": "U.S. President Donald Trump said he had a \"big talk\" with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Saudi King Salman regarding oil production, expressing hopes that a deal on the control of said production would be announced soon.\"We had a big talk as to oil production and OPEC and making it so that our industry does well and the oil industry does better than its doing right now,\" Trump said as quoted by Reuters.It remains unclear whether the deal Trump mentioned would involve the participation of the United States: Reuters reported on the U.S. president's statement after OPEC+ sources announced that it had reached an agreement in principle to remove 10 million bpd from global supply beginning in May.It remains to be seen how much everyone will cut. Initial reports from unofficial OPEC sources suggest that Russia and Saudi Arabia will both slash their production to around 8.5 million bpd.Following those unofficial reports that were trickling in, OPEC issued a press release, in which it said that all producers would be cutting from a baseline of their average for October 2018 except Russia and Saudi Arabia, \"both with the same baseline level of 11.0 mb/d.\"The cuts, according to the press release, would be effective from May, and taper down after June, but staying effective at some level through April 2022, to be reviewed in December next year. This is quite a long time for an agreement of this size, which indicates OPEC+ is finally taking the threat that the pandemic is to world oil economic activity and oil demand seriously. However, it may, as some warned, be too little too late.A cut of 10 million bpd, even if it is effective for two months, as planned, would not do much to relieve the glut, which according to estimates may have reached 30 million bpd. The group said it expected other producers to join in with cuts of another 15 million bpd, which would be better for excess supply and storage capacity.

Sources told Reuters last week that BP has reduced refinery run rates at its 430,000-bpd refinery in Whiting, Indiana, the 242,000-bpd Cherry Point, Washington, refinery, and the 155,000-bpd in Toledo, Ohio, refinery, due to low demand from U.S. consumers.Oil majors began to reduce refinery run rates across the U.S. at the end of March when states began to take measures to flatten the curve for the number of coronavirus cases. U.S. oil supermajor ExxonMobil has reduced the run rates at its second-largest refinery in the United States, Baton Rouge in Louisiana, after slumping fuel demand filled storage tanks, sources with knowledge of the operations at the 502,500-bpd refinery told Reuters last month.Despite the low gasoline prices, demand for fuel in the United States, and across the world, is taking a major hit as people are asked or ordered to stay at home as countries grapple with the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. Oil demand in the United States is set to tumble over the following weeks, as cities are under lockdown, non-essential businesses and services are closed, and people are asked to work from home wherever possible.Meanwhile, gasoline inventories in the United States continue to climb, along with crude oil inventory builds. During the latest reporting week, to April 3, U.S. oil inventories swelled by 15.2 million barrels, the EIA said on Wednesday, a week after reporting the largest oil inventory build since 2016. The EIA also reported gasoline inventories had increased by 10.5 million barrels and distillate fuel inventories had added 476,000 barrels.

While Oxy is seeking government help for the U.S. energy industry, it is opposing ideas that the Texas Railroad Commission impose production restrictions in Texas.\"It is Occidental's position that the surge in the supply of oil coupled with the decline in oil demand will resolve itself without state regulatory interference,\" Bloomberg quoted Oxy as saying in a note to the Texas oil regulator. Production cuts in Texas would mess up contractual obligations and therefore, they would be \"extremely short-sighted,\" according to Occidental.ExxonMobil also opposes production cuts in Texas, the U.S. supermajor said in a letter on Wednesday, as carried by Reuters.The free market is \"the most efficient means of sorting out the extreme supply and demand imbalances we are now experiencing,\" Staale Gjervik, president of Exxon's shale division, said in the letter to Texas regulators.U.S. President Trump said this week he believes American oil production cuts would happen automatically thanks to the nature of the free market.Texas Railroad Commissioner Ryan Sitton said on Wednesday that the U.S. would cut at least 4 million bpd in the next three months organically.

As prices collapsed and uncertainty blanketed the global oil market, companies operating on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS) began to announce reduced spending and are likely to defer the spudding of some exploration wells initially planned for 2020, the NPD said.  At the start of the year, companies were planning some 50 exploration wells for 2020 in total.\"What we're seeing now, is both exploration wells being postponed and delays/cancellations of geophysical mapping. As of today, it appears that around 10 exploration wells will be postponed, meaning that there will be about 40 exploration wells in 2020. However, we can't rule out further changes in this area in the future,\" NPD's Director General Ingrid Solvberg said.\"At the moment there is considerable uncertainty surrounding which activities will be cancelled or postponed over the next few months,\" Solvberg said, noting that the authority is following developments closely to understand the potential resource consequences of delays and cancellations.\"Substantial cost cuts have been announced, reducing both exploration activity, investments and operating costs moving forward,\" Solvberg said.\"Reduced exploration activity over the longer term will therefore also affect future production on the shelf,\" the NPD said.Shorter term, the crisis will lead to job losses and dramatic consequences for the supply chain of Norway's oil and gas industry, as highly skilled staff who will lose petroleum industry jobs are likely to find employment in other industries, the NPD warned.The directorate follows the dynamic nature of developments on the oil market and in Norway's industry, \"But this is a serious and demanding situation,\" NPD's Solvberg said.A few days ago, Tina Bru, Minister for Petroleum and Energy of Western Europe's biggest oil producer, told Reuters that Norway could discuss reducing its oil production if the world's major producers reach a deal on significantly cutting global oil production.

The bank offered the loans for sale at 98.75 cents on the dollar for at least US$50 million of a PIF loan, and at 99 cents on the dollar for loans to Mubadala, Reuters reports. Apart from JPMorgan, other international banks with loans to oil producing countries in the Gulf have also tried to sell down their exposure to the wealth funds in the Middle East, a source based in the Persian Gulf told Reuters.\"Generally the expectation this year is there will be a lot of asks for the region ... so you make room ahead of that,\" the source told Reuters.Middle East oil producers have already started to tap the debt markets amid growing fiscal pressures on their economies and wealth funds in the oil price crash and the coronavirus pandemic.Qatar sold this week US$10 billion in three-tranche bonds, which received four times as many offers--a sign that investors lapped up the 'juicy yields' that Qatar offered. Qatar's bond issue--the first in the Gulf region since oil prices crashed and the pandemic battered economies and oil demand--is viewed as a test for investor interest in bonds from Middle East's oil producers amid collapsing oil prices.

For all depths above 200 meters, the royalty rate is 18.75 percent. The shallow water rate was reduced in 2017 as part of the Trump administration's energy industry support agenda.The Department is ready to provide royalty relief to companies that need it, Louisiana Senator Bill Cassidy told Reuters. \"He promised to quickly process targeted royalty relief on the outer continental shelf using existing law,\" Cassidy said.The U.S. oil industry has been among the harder-hit by the oil price collapse, and the royalty relief application suggests it is not just shale players that are affected by the low oil prices.Crude oil prices have fallen by more than 50 percent since the start of the year, with some U.S. grades in single-digit territory. As a result, production has begun falling, too. Last week, production fell by 600,000 bpd to 12.4 million bpd, according to the latest weekly petroleum status report released by the Energy Information Administration.Production is expected to fall further, with the EIA estimating over this year and next, the daily average of the U.S. could shed 2 million bpd, with the figure for this year seen at 11.8 million bpd.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

The base salary of its president, Jeff Lyash, was last year $920,000, which compares with $400,000 for Trump himself. Yet Lyash received a total of $8.16 million, most of it coming from performance-based bonuses and a $1.8-million one-time payment for Lyash's agreement to relocate from Canada to the U.S.\"I don't know the gentleman, but he's got a heck of a job,\" Trump said, as quoted by the Chattanooga Times Free Press. \"He gets paid a lot of money, which is an amazing thing.\"A spokesman for Tennessee Valley Authority countered with the argument that unlike other federal companies, TVA does not receive taxpayer funds.\"TVA has not received taxpayer funding in more than 20 years,\" Kim Hopson said. \"We are entirely self-financed by power revenues from our customers. Because of the importance of our mission, we must have a competitive compensation package to attract and retain the highly skilled talent needed to serve those who count on us.\"Trump seems to be at odds with the company because of coal. Last year, the President asked the Tennessee Valley Authority to keep a coal-fired power plant in Kentucky running, but the utility refused to do so and shut down its last unit earlier this year, as it was cheaper than keeping it running.\"When we want them to do something for us, they are not there for us, and that's not good,\" Trump said.The U.S. president floated the idea of an infrastructure aid package worth some $2 trillion at the end of last month.\"It should be VERY BIG & BOLD, Two Trillion Dollars, and be focused solely on jobs and rebuilding the once great infrastructure of our Country!

Faced with plummeting oil prices, many Canadian companies hastened to reduce capital spending, curtail operations, defer investments and start-ups, cut executive salaries, and lay off workers.Major oil producers such as Saudi Arabia, Russia, and the United States are set to discuss ways to potentially cut global oil production by 10 million bpd later this week at an OPEC+ video meeting on Thursday and a G20 energy ministers' video conference on Friday.The leaders of the OPEC+ group, Saudi Arabia for OPEC and Russia for non-OPEC, are reportedly ready to negotiate a massive global production cut amid sinking demand, despite a bitter weekend spat between the former allies about who ditched whom in the OPEC+ talks.   Both Saudi Arabia and Russia are signaling that they are ready to talk but are pointing out that any massive cut should involve the United States, too, and are hinting at the participation of every major oil producer.Analysts say that even if a larger so-called OPEC++ group - involving OPEC+ plus the U.S., Canada, Brazil, Norway, and other producers not part of OPEC+, were to agree to a massive cut of 10 million bpd, this will still be much lower than the demand loss expected in Q2 and will not go far to prevent global storage filling to the brim by mid-May.

        "content": "Marathon Oil slashed on Wednesday its 2020 capital spending budget for a second time in one month and announced frac holidays in the Bakken and Eagle Ford amid extremely weak commodity prices and demand.  Marathon Oil's latest updated 2020 capital expenditure (capex) is $1.3 billion, or $1.1 billion lower than its initial spending guidance for this year of $2.4 billion. This year's capital spending is now expected to be 50 percent lower than the actual spend in 2019, Marathon Oil said on Wednesday, in its second capex cut in a month since the oil prices collapsed in early March.Last month, after the OPEC+ deal collapse and the start of the Saudi-Russian oil price war, Marathon Oil announced an immediate capex reduction of at least $500 million, \"in light of the dramatic fall in commodity prices.\"  Today, Marathon Oil announced a second capex cut, with Marathon Oil Chairman, President, and CEO Lee Tillman saying:\"In light of extreme commodity price weakness and anticipated ongoing demand impacts, we have dramatically reduced activity in REx, Oklahoma and the Northern Delaware, and plan to take frac holidays in both the Bakken and Eagle Ford during second quarter. We're maintaining our returns-first mindset with a focus on preserving value through the cycle.\"\"Against a highly volatile and uncertain environment, these decisive actions are designed first and foremost to protect our balance sheet and our hard earned financial strength. We remain investment grade at all primary rating agencies, with recent reviews by both Fitch and S&P, and maintain a strong liquidity position with no near-term debt maturities. Our financial strength, high quality portfolio, and ongoing focus on reducing our cost structure position us well to navigate this extraordinary time for our industry,\" Tillman said.  Premium: How To Find A \"Bargain\" In A Distressed Energy SectorSince the oil price crash a month ago, U.S. oil producers, including supermajors Exxon and Chevron, have been rushing to cut budgets and exposure to the most prolific shale basin in the United States, the Permian. As at the end of March, 22 independent U.S. producers had cut 2020 investment by a total of $20 billion, an average of 35 percent, and three by 50 percent or more, Simon Flowers, Chairman and Chief Analyst at Wood Mackenzie, said last week. \"The size of cuts is close to those of 2015 and have come through faster. Yet companies today are far leaner than back then; and what we've seen so far may just be a taste of what's to come. Diamondback and Occidental have already cut twice in two weeks, suggesting further, deeper cuts are coming for many US Independents,'' Flowers said.

The ministers of G20, currently chaired by Saudi Arabia, are discussing on Friday possible ways to contribute to a global oil production cut deal and to discuss energy developments and markets while the world is fighting the coronavirus pandemic.The OPEC+ group has reached a tentative deal to collectively cut production by 10 million bpd and is also tentatively looking for another collective 5 million bpd cut from producers outside the OPEC+ format, mostly the United States, Canada, Brazil, and Norway.The U.S. is signaling that its oil production will drop anyway because drillers are cutting spending and drilling at oil prices in the low $20s.U.S. Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette said at the G20 video meeting that all nations should think about how they could contribute to reducing the oil market imbalance.\"We call on all nations to use every means at their disposal to help reduce the surplus,\" Brouillette said in prepared remarks at G20, as carried by Reuters.Countries relying on crude oil imports could soon unveil a plan to buy crude to put in their strategic reserves as a way to help crashing oil demand amid the oil glut, Fatih Birol, Executive Director at the International Energy Agency (IEA), told Al Arabiya news outlet on Thursday.Countries importing oil \"are going to contribute to the solution ... by buying oil to put in their strategic reserves in order to give a lifeline to demand,\" Birol told Al Arabiya.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads from Oilprice.com:"

The restructuring charges are designed to right-size the company's operations for reduced activity levels and anticipated market conditions.Baker Hughes also plans to cut its 2020 net capex by more than 20 percent compared to its actual net capital expenditures for 2019.\"[T]he uncertainty related to oil demand continues to have a significant impact on the investment and operating plans of our primary customers. Based on these events, Baker Hughes concluded that a triggering event occurred which required the Company to perform an interim quantitative impairment test as of March 31, 2020,\" the company said in a statement.Baker Hughes is the latest oilfield services provider to announce measures to protect cash flows and reduce spending as the U.S. shale patch, including supermajors Exxon and Chevron, has been rushing to cut budgets and exposure to the most prolific shale basin in the United States, the Permian. At the end of March, Schlumberger and Halliburton joined the ranks of oil companies on a spending-cutting spree amid the steep oil price drop.Schlumberger said it would slash its spending by 30 percent less than it spent in 2019 and cut the number of active drilling rigs in North America, possibly to as low as it was in 2016.Halliburton said in mid-March that it would furlough 3,500 employees for two months and laid off 350 workers in Oklahoma earlier this month.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "OPEC's top producer and the world's top oil exporter, Saudi Arabia, may soon tap the international debt market to raise money as the oil price crash and the historic oil production cut deal are hitting the Kingdom's primary source of external revenues - oil income, four banking sources told Reuters on Monday.   Saudi Arabia's oil revenues were already hit by the plunge in oil prices in March after the Kingdom went on a price war with Russia to claim more market share. The Kingdom reduced government expenditures last month to save money as oil income crashed.The historic oil production cut deal from Sunday, with OPEC+ agreeing to cut their overall crude oil production by 9.7 million bpd in May and June, will be putting additional pressure on Saudi finances because the Kingdom will have to cut a lot from its current production.According to an analyst who spoke to Reuters, the Saudi cuts in production would reduce the government revenues by almost US$40 billion in 2020 if oil prices average $40 per barrel. A day after the Sunday deal was announced, Brent Crude prices were barely in the low $30s, erasing early Monday gains to fall by 0.70% to $31.23 at 8:20 a.m. EDT, as the market appears to see the deal as not enough to respond to the demand loss.Middle East oil producers have already started to tap the debt markets amid growing fiscal pressures on their economies and wealth funds. Qatar sold at the start of last week US $10 billion in three-tranche bonds, which received four times as many offers. Qatar's bond issue--the first in the Gulf region since oil prices crashed and the pandemic battered economies and oil demand--was viewed as a test for investor interest in bonds from Middle East's oil producers amid collapsing oil prices. Abu Dhabi also sold US$7 billion in bonds after Qatar's debt issue, sources told Reuters last Wednesday.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "title": "Could U.S. Airlines Be Nationalized?",
        "content": "With airlines facing a $250-billion loss in revenue for 2020 at a minimum, the additional $35 billion they might have to pay in the form of refunds over the next few months makes for a staggering amount. The dire situation has led pundits to ponder whether the industry might be willing to climb into bed with the government in a quasi-nationalization plan that would bail them out. The rules of the airline bailout game changed mid-match. Congress had promised $58 billion to the airlines in the form of a bailout in line with the CARES Act. Of that, $50 billion was to be directed to passenger airlines, with $25 billion in grants and $25 billion in loans to be paid back. At the 11th hour, however, that $25 billion in grants was reduced to $17.5 billion, with the remainder another low-interest rate loan. In other words, the airlines are only getting a $17.5-billion bailout--the rest will have to be paid back, and they will have to offer stock warrants on approximately 10% of the loan amount, which could subsequently be converted to shares by the government, according to the Wall Street Journal. Indeed, it's not nearly as much of a bailout as the industry was hoping for, even according to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.\"It is our objective to make sure, as I have said, that this is not a bailout, but to make sure that airlines have the liquidity to keep their workers in place,\" Mnuchin told CNBC on April 11th.  Premium: Where Does Oil Go After The Largest Production Cut In History?Beyond the tweaked numbers, airlines will also have to contend with restrictions that say they cannot lay off workers or cut salaries until October, nor can they engage in share buybacks or the paying out of dividends to shareholders. It could very well mean bankruptcy for some airlines, whose only play left may be to sell shares to the government.Regardless, with restrictions in place--including the requirement that airlines continue to fly to locations they had been flying to prior to March 1st--the government has an immense amount of control over their operations. In fact, it's no longer up to the airlines where they fly and how often, it's up to the Secretary of Transportation, as pointed out by Reason magazine. It's nationalization to a certain degree because bailout money, in whatever form, is dependent on so many restrictions. American Airlines (NYSE:AAL)American has slashed its flight schedule for May by 80%, and year-to-date its stock has shed 56%. Voluntary leave and retirement is the name of the game now for American Airlines and flight attendants. Some 4,800 American pilots will take up voluntary leave in April in May, while over 700 will take early retirement with partial pay and full benefits, while nearly 8,000 flight attendants will take voluntary leave, with early retirement for nearly 800. American Airlines has over $7 billion in liquidity, but it also has a serious debt load that has nothing to do with COVID-19 or the bleeding of revenue to come due to flight cancellations, paid leave and early retirement. That's because this is American's second bailout party in 20 years. The first was the aftermath of 9/11, which it survived thanks to the grace of the government, a merger and the entire industry's subsequent binge on cheap debt. At the beginning of this year, the airline had nearly $30 billion in liabilities, according to InvestorPlace, while its current market cap is only around $5 billion.From 2014 through 2019, American spent nearly $13 billion combined on buybacks and dividends, yet here we are. We're discussing a stock that trades at a third of the levels it did in early 2014 and is flirting with all time lows.So, while American Airlines shares got a bit of a boost Monday, it didn't go unnoticed that it underperformed its peers, nonetheless, leading JPMorgan analyst Jamie Baker to downgrade American from \"underweight\" to \"overweight\" because of the airline's \"negative\" equity value and what seems set to be rather lengthy post-coronavirus recovery. Delta Air Lines Inc. (NYSE:DAL)Year-to-date, Delta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) stock is down about 58%, which means the shares are now in a bear market. The company has already suspended share buybacks and dividends, though the terms of the 'bailout' would have required this anyway. Last month, Delta CEO Ed Bastian confirmed that the airline had negative net bookings, had cut about 70% of capacity, and grounded 600 planes. Despite all of that, the company also announced that it would start loading airplanes from back to front, a new boarding procedure taking social distancing in mind. Premium: A Global Oil Cartel?On Friday, Delta said 35,000 of its 90,000 employees had volunteered for some sort of leave as the airline seeks to staunch the bleeding on its approximately $60-million-daily cash burn.  So far in April, Delta's shares are down over 20%, and even Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has slashed its roughly 11% stake in Delta by nearly one-fifth, from 71.9 million shares to 58.9 million. According to regulatory filings, last Wednesday Berkshire sold nearly 13 million Delta shares for about $314 million.Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV)Berkshire Hathaway also sold about 2.3 million shares in Southwest (NYSE:LUV), reducing its stake in the airline by just over 4%, for about $74 million.  Some 20,000 Southwest Airlines employees, of a quarter of total number, have signed up for varying levels of time off and leave as the company looks to cut costs. Southwest also halted all share repurchases in mid-March, but since the beginning of 2020, the company had spent $585 million on stock buybacks.But Southwest is rather cashed up, unlike American. LUV started 2020 with $4.1 billion of cash and short-term investments while it took two $1-billion loans, giving the company a cash balance of $6.2 billion. That's pretty good considering that in Q2 2019 its operating expenses were $4.94 billion.United Airlines Holdings (NYSE:UAL)United said it is losing more than $100 million a day in revenue and that it expects fourth-quarter revenue to be down at least 30% from the year-ago period. United Airlines (NYSE:UAL) has taken a nose-dive with its stock falling 70% since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. The company had 96,000 employees at the start of the year and announced massive layoff without federal aid. The company said that it will take the necessary steps to reduce our payroll to match a 60% reduction in flying planned for April. It means that layoffs could be close to 58,000 jobs. Despite the fact that the airline temporarily suspended all long-haul international flights, now it has opened up booking for three transatlantic flights to Europe and two additional nonstop flights to South America for the beginning of May.The worst-case scenario in terms of COVID-19 has already been priced in for the travel industry, and for airlines in particular, but for some more than others (American, for instance, is not likely to recover as quickly as Delta because of its massive debt) the lesson that wasn't learned after 9/11 may finally be learned this time around, even if it is too late. This is a government game now. By Michael Kern for Safehaven.com More Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "China's oil imports may have declined in March, a Reuters poll of 31 economists showed on Monday, while experts expect China's economy to have sharply contracted in the first quarter of the year due to the coronavirus pandemic.  China, the world's top oil importer and key oil demand growth driver, went in lockdown at the end of January and February to try to stop the spreading of COVID-19. As a result, demand for energy for industrial activity and for fuel sharply dropped.Chinese oil imports held up in the first two months, because volumes had been contracted weeks before the first public announcement of the virus and because Chinese refiners typically stock up on crude before the Chinese Lunar New Year, which was at the end of January this year. China's crude oil imports increased by 5.2 percent on the year in January-February to come in at 10.47 million barrels per day (bpd), according to Reuters calculations on data from the Chinese General Administration of Customs.In March and early April, China was said to have been building its crude reserves, thanks to the cheapest oil in years, but the rate of filling storage would be lower than in previous years because of limited storage capacity, lending less support to oil prices this time around than in previous years, Wood Mackenzie said at the end of last month.Premium: A Global Oil Cartel?Oil imports, however, are just a part of China's trade and economy, which as per the Reuters survey, are expected to have contracted in March because of limited demand from overseas amid lockdowns in major other economies.According to economists polled by Reuters, China's first-quarter GDP likely contracted sharply, for the first time in nearly 30 years, since 1992.While China reopened cities and the economy, the rest of the world started to close down to try to flatten the curve of the coronavirus cases.\"Despite some possible improvements in economic activity in March, first-quarter GDP growth is expected to contract by 10% from a year earlier,\" Tao Wang, an economist at UBS, told Reuters, referring to the Chinese economy.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "A group of private oil services companies in Venezuela has called on the government to relax stringent rules against gasoline imports amid critical shortages of the essential fuel, Reuters reports, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter.\"It is necessary, but it is not viable,\" one of the sources said, commenting on the precarious situation that fuel retailers are in.According to Venezuelan legislation, the state is the only party allowed to sell gasoline on the local market. Fuel sales are also heavily subsidized, which makes the fuel extremely cheap--this would make it extremely difficult for private sellers to turn a profit, even if Caracas allows them to start importing the fuel.Venezuela suspended imports of gasoline from the United States last year as the political row between the two escalated, and since then, a shortage of the fuel has been building. Last month, the government started to close fuel stations across the country because of the shortage. According to an unnamed source who spoke to Bloomberg in late March, the government will leave only a few stations open to be managed by the army. These, however, will only service medical, food transport, and utility vehicles.Local production of gasoline has also been declining because of the suspension of diluent imports from the U.S. Diluents are necessary to make the superheavy Venezuelan crude more liquid and fit for refining. Refineries themselves have been suffering the effects of years of underinvestment, and run rates are low.Venezuelan refineries are currently operating at less than 10 percent of capacity, according to Reuters, because of this combination of diluent shortages and disrepair.\"Fuel is indispensable for the health and food sectors, and so we must temporarily deregulate the internal market and allow the importation of fuels from various external private sources,\" a regional chapter of the Venezuelan Oil Chamber said in a tweet last week. It was the same chapter that submitted the proposal to allow imports and sales from private companies to the government in Caracas.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

We acknowledge the importance of international cooperation in ensuring the resilience of energy systems.\"This is indeed way too vague for anyone's comfort, although some hailed the G20's declaration of support for the OPEC+ cuts as a positive development. Such broad support for an oil production-cutting effort is unprecedented, just like the crisis that prompted it. Still, there is a figure for at least one G20 member: the United States.U.S. President Trump spoke with his Mexican counterpart on Friday after Mexico refused to sign up for cuts of 400,000 bpd under the OPEC+ agreement. Following his talks with Trump, Mexico's Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said that the U.S. would implement cuts of 250,000 bpd to help Mexico, which will cut 100,000 bpd. Trump confirmed the agreement, saying Mexico will \"reimburse\" the U.S. when it can.Besides this 250,000 bpd cut, U.S. oil production could be lowered by as much as 2 million bpd by the end of the year, Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette said at the G20 meeting, as quoted by the Financial Times.\"This is a time for all nations to seriously examine what each can do to correct the supply/demand imbalance,\" Brouillette said in what could be seen as a departure from the official White House position until recently that the U.S. did not need to cut oil production on purpose because low prices would force a decline in production anyway.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

Tesla's sales in China in March were up from 3,900 vehicle sales in February, and up from 2,620 vehicles sold in January, according to CPCA data cited by Reuters.Tesla's newly operational Shanghai Gigafactory was temporarily closed for a few weeks between the end of January and February due to government-mandated temporary shutdowns of industrial production because of the coronavirus outbreak. The Gigafactory resumed production in the second week of February.To boost sales in the world's top car market, Tesla has increased home delivery services to encourage more potential buyers to buy a Tesla, Business Times reports.At the beginning of 2019, Tesla started the construction of a production facility in the world's top EV market--China--in order to be able to compete on a level playing field with a growing number of local EV manufacturers.

Instead, Mexico has agreed to cut 100,000 bpd, which is unlikely to satiate OPEC+.Not wanting the deal to fail--in fact, needing it to succeed--Trump agreed to help Mexico.

Trump did not cite this figure during the briefing and stressed that he did not know if OPEC would be okay with the deal AMLO and Trump cooked up.It is unclear exactly how the United States would cut 250,000 bpd in such a free-market system that does not give the President the powers to mandate specific production levels. Trump has, however, on previous occasions indicated that this free market system will naturally drive U.S. producers to reduce run rates as storage nears capacity and oil prices fall.President Vladimir Putin had previously dismissed the idea of a natural production cut as a result of the market.The G20 group that is meeting today was set to discuss the production agreement from OPEC+. OPEC+ was hoping to pick up another 5 million bpd of cuts from G20 members today, in addition to the already 10 million bpd of cuts that OPEC+ agreed to.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

Other companies, such as Vista Oil & Gas, have also reduced their production due to the crashing fuel demand in the country, Rio Negro reported.  At the end of last month, YPF warned that the mandatory nationwide quarantine had already slashed fuel demand in Argentina and said there were \"difficult\" times ahead for the company. YPF's executive president Daniel Gonzalez said in an internal company video seen by Reuters that Argentina's demand for gasoline had already plunged by 70 percent five days after the mandatory lockdown, adding that diesel demand had slumped by nearly 50 percent, and jet fuel demand had crashed by 90 percent.\"This will leave us with the need to export crude oil at low prices, with which our income will clearly be negatively affected,\" Gonzalez said in the video.The crashing demand first led to refineries filling up their tanks. After stockpiles filled up storage in Argentina, it became clear that some production had to be reduced, according to the Rio Negro outlet.So YPF moved to slash by 50 percent its oil production in Loma Campana in Argentina's key shale play, Vaca Muerta, where the Argentine state oil firm is partnering with U.S. supermajor Chevron. YPF produces more than 40,000 bpd at Loma Campana, and it is said to have agreed with Chevron to reduce oil production, Rio Negro reported.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

The largest drop in oil production, according to the EIA, should be this month, down 193,625 barrels per day from March.The Drilling Productivity Report shows six weeks of sizeable declines, shedding more than a half a million barrels per day--546,622 barrels--since December 2019.Nevertheless, oil production across those seven basins are still trending sharply upward overall over the last decade.And year over year, oil production is still up, despite the sharp declines over the last few weeks.Oil demand and oil prices have declined sharply in recent months, with global oil demand destruction thought to be somewhere near 30-35 million bpd. Meanwhile, oil prices have been particularly volatile, with WTI trading under $30 for almost a month.Image: EIAThe EIA expects the Permian basin, responsible for more than half of the reported shale production, will see a dip of 75,700 bpd in May, to 4.5 million barrels per day. The second largest basin, the Eagle Ford, should see a drop of 34,790 barrels per day, to 1.3 million bpd.All basins are expected to see a production drop for May, according to the EIA.And it's not just oil that's being hit; natural gas production, too, is expected to decline next month.The EIA sees natural gas production in the seven basins dropping by 869 million cubic feet per day, to 83,158 million cubic feet per day.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "The historic OPEC+ production cut deal may have prevented a total disaster in the oil market, but it will be unable to stave off the impending global oil inventory build that is threatening to fill all the available storage in the world over the next few weeks, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Wednesday.\"Never before has the oil industry come this close to testing its logistics capacity to the limit,\" the agency said in its closely-watched Oil Market Report for April.According to the IEA, the demand loss due to the coronavirus pandemic could result in a stock build of 12 million barrels per day (bpd) in the first half 2020, despite the OPEC+ decision to cut collective production by 9.7 million bpd in May and June.The glut \"still threatens to overwhelm the logistics of the oil industry - ships, pipelines and storage tanks - in the coming weeks,\" the Paris-based agency said in the report.Overall, the global storage capacity may be overwhelmed by the middle of this year. Still, there are already signs of logistics strains in many places around the world and at other parts of the logistics chain, such as competition for buying space on pipelines systems. At many sites, it's not possible to store different crude grades, while some crudes and oil products need special tanks for storage, the IEA said.Offshore, traders are scrambling to book floating storage, and charter rates for supertankers are skyrocketing, the agency noted.Storage costs are surging, and so are costs for chartering tankers to store oil at sea for future sales when traders expect demand to recover from the pandemic-hit plunge.One factor that could alleviate the glut and \"create extra headroom for the impending stock build-up\" is the fact that China, India, Korea, and the United States \"have either offered their strategic storage capacity to industry to temporarily park unwanted barrels or are considering increasing their strategic stocks to take advantage of lower prices,\" the IEA said.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Oil producers operating in North Dakota have idled more than a quarter of the oil wells in the state, the AP reported, citing a statement by a state regulator to local daily the Bismarck Tribune.The collective output of the wells idled since the start of March, which numbered 4,600, was some 260,000 bpd, the State Mineral Resources Director Lynn Helms, told the Bismarck Tribune. This is a large portion of the state's total oil output, which averaged some 1.45 million bpd in February, according to data from the state's Department of Mineral Resources.During that time, North Dakota shed as much as 40 percent of drilling rigs, proving Washington officials arguments that the U.S. did not have to deliberately cut oil production because the low-price environment would force voluntary production cuts to curb the cash bleeds that most producers are experiencing because their breakeven level is higher than current benchmark prices.Some North Dakota oil producers, according to Helms, are considering building storage facilities near the wells, to stock up on the crude they have already pumped out, and sell it later when prices improve.Meanwhile, in Texas, the state energy industry regulator is hearing statements for and against a mandatory cut in oil production. Smaller independents seem to mostly back the cuts while larger companies, including Exxon Chevron, and Marathon, are against them.For the smaller companies, statewide production cuts would be beneficial, helping them continue to sell some oil, according to one industry executive. Larger companies are naturally opposed because they have more cash reserves and lower production costs that will ensure their survival anyway.The hearing follows the announcement of historic production cuts among the members of OPEC+ and additional cuts coming from other non-OPEC producers such as Norway and Brazil. Even these moves, however, were not enough to lend support to U.S. oil prices.

The price of a Brent barrel was also trading down on Tuesday, by $1.75 (-5.15%), at $29.99--down by more than $2 week on week.The API reported a build of 2.226 million barrels of gasoline for week ending April 10, after last week's 9.445-million-barrel build. This week's build compares to analyst expectations for a larger 6.386-million-barrel build for the week.Distillate inventories were up by 5.640 million barrels for the week, compared to last week's 177,000-barrel draw, while Cushing inventories saw a large gain of 5.361 million barrels.US crude oil production as estimated by the Energy Information Administration showed that production for the week ending April 3 fell to 12.4 million bpd--down 600,000 bpd for the week.At 4:35 pm EDT, WTI was trading at $20.78 while Brent was trading at $30.06.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "This weekend's 11th hour decision to cut OPEC oil output by 23% was supposed to end the oil price war between Saudi Arabia and the rest of OPEC+, but it appears Saudi Arabia did not get the memo.While oil production may (or may not) be cut by 9.7mmb/d on May 1, Riyadh remembered that to capture market share one can manipulate volumes, which are now set as per this weekend's OPEC+ agreement or one can adjust price discounts, which are not. And as the kingdom faces stiff competition from rival suppliers for market share in the prized Asian market (or at least what's left of it after India cut demand by 70%), the OPEC leader slashed its official selling prices to Asian customers for May by larger-than-expected margins this week, while keeping prices flat for Europe and raising them for the United States.On Monday, Saudi Arabia's oil giant Aramco set the May price for its Arab light crude oil to Asia at a discount of $7.3 to the Oman/Dubai average, down $4.2 a barrel from April, according to a document seen by Reuters. Asian refiners had called on Saudi Arabia to slash its crude OSPs for a third straight month in May after Middle East benchmarks and refining margins dropped amid ample supplies and lower demand due to the coronavirus. Overnight, China's customs bureau reported that overseas energy purchases weakened in March as demand from the top importer took a hit from the coronavirus pandemic. Crude oil imports fell to the equivalent of about 9.72 million barrels a day, the least since July.While Aramco cut Asian prices in hopes of beating Russia, Iran and other producers to the punch, it raised the May OSP of its Arab light crude oil to the United States to a discount of $0.75 per barrel versus the Argus Sour Crude Index (ASCI), up $3 a barrel from April, according to the document.  Aramco left its OSP for Arab light crude oil to Northwestern Europe unchanged from April at a discount of $10.25 per barrel to ICE Brent.Premium: A Global Oil Cartel?The cut in prices to Asia reflect weak demand, while OSPs to Europe and the United States reflect oil market fundamentals and the global supply cut pact, an industry source familiar with the pricing process told Reuters.Then on Tuesday morning, Saudi Aramco again cut official selling prices of all four grades to new record lows from Egyptian port of Sidi Kerir for May, in line with big cuts in prices for other customer regions, with some grades sold at a discount of as much as $10.95/bbl:Prices of all four crude grades from Sidi Kerir are 45c higher than those shipped from Ras Tanura in Persian Gulf for customers in Mediterranean, compared with 20c higher in April's price list.And so, between the IMF's warning earlier today, and Saudi Arabia's quiet restart of the oil price war, Brent tumbled by over 5.5% this morning, sliding below $30, after hitting a high over $36 just two trading days ago as the unprecedented chaos in the energy market continues.By Zerohedge.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

U.S. oil producers are currently suffering from the lowest oil prices in years, with the benchmark WTI Crude in the low $20s despite this weekend's historic global oil deal for which U.S. President Donald Trump is also taking credit.  The initial idea of the U.S. Administration to help the U.S. oil patch was to buy 77 million barrels of oil from American producers to remove some of the overhang in the market, fill the SPR to its maximum capacity with the cheapest oil in years, and help oil producers. After the plan failed to get funding for oil included the $2 trillion stimulus package, the DOE announced on April 2 that it would \"immediately make 30 million barrels of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve's (SPR's) oil storage capacity available to U.S. oil producers that are struggling with catastrophic financial losses due to the combined impacts of COVID-19 and the intentional disruption of world oil markets by foreign actors.\" The awards negotiations announced by the DOE today will be for around 23 million barrels of crude oil storage across all four SPR sites. Most of the crude oil deliveries will be received in May and June 2020, with possible early deliveries in April, DOE said.  \"When producing oil you have two options - you either use it or you store it. With the impacts caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we are seeing an enormous decrease in demand as our country works to contain the virus,\" U.S. Secretary of Energy Dan Brouillette said in a statement.\"This is why making storage capacity available in the SPR is so important.

The issue comes amid a record-high spike in investment-grade corporate bond issues over the last few weeks as the Fed signaled it would do whatever it takes to keep markets well supplied with money, including launching a $2.3-trillion bond-buying program.Earlier this month, Exxon said it would cut its capital expenditure plans by as much as 30 percent. It also said it would trim cash operating expenses by 15 percent in response to the combination of a sharp drop in demand for oil and oil products, and excessive supply.\"After a thorough evaluation of the impacts of the pandemic and market conditions, we have worked closely with business partners to plan and execute capital adjustments that preserve long-term value, maximize cost efficiency, and put us in the strongest position when market conditions improve,\" chief executive Darren Woods said in the news release.Premium: Missiles Fired In Iraq As Proxy War Heats UpThe critical factor for oil producers now is determining when market conditions will improve. An unprecedented agreement among OPEC and non-OPEC producers will remove more than 10 million bpd from global markets, with countries such as Norway, Brazil, and the United States for the first time taking part in such a concerted effort at controlling supply. However, this may not be enough in light of how badly demand for oil has suffered because of the pandemic.Estimates of how much demand has been lost due to the combination of too much supply and too little demand have ranged between 15 million bpd and 30 million bpd. In any case, the loss of demand is much higher than the production cut agreed on this weekend. What's more, the recovery is questionable: some countries are mulling an extension of the lockdowns, and some Asian countries are reporting a rise in new cases after a decline, suggesting that a second wave of infections may be on the way. This will prolong the recovery, which will, in turn, delay any lasting improvement in oil demand.

The total for the first quarter, according to official customs data, was 130 million tons.Reuters reported that the March average was an 11.7-percent increase on the year--a signal that the country was stockpiling cheap oil while the price rout continues. Independent refiners again appear to have spearheaded the growth in foreign oil buying, even though domestic--and regional--demand for fuels was lower than supply even before the coronavirus pandemic took hold.According to one Chinese analyst who spoke to Reuters, the rise in oil imports will continue this month and next. Economic activity in China has begun to recover, albeit slowly. Still, unless a second wave of infections prompts another tightening of the movement of people, chance are it will continue to improve in the coming months.Interestingly, the oil import increase data comes on the heels of a Reuters poll among economists, who said they expected a dip in imports in March.Even though this increase in oil buying is good news, it may not be enough. China always buys oil when it's cheap to fill its strategic reserves. This year, however, it will be buying at a lower than usual rate because there is already quite a lot of oil in storage, according to Wood Mackenzie.A second major importer, India, is also buying cheap oil for its strategic reserve, lending hope to the battered world oil industry that prices might improve. However, India has limited storage capacity. Data from Refinitiv suggests that February was the strongest month for oil imports since the start of the year, with imports up 10 percent on the year, versus a 5.6-percent increase over January and a 16.4-percent increase for March, However, the March total was a record high, at 19.84 million tons, or about 4.85 million bpd.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

The Railroad Commission of Texas will hold a meeting on Tuesday that could potentially result in mandated caps on the state's oil output after watching WTI prices collapse by more than 60 percent so far this year.  It also comes as domestic oil storage quickly approaches its absolute limit. Ryan Sitton, one of three commissioners at the regulatory body, noted that significant cuts could \"stave off a total oil industry meltdown.\" Such a radical decision, which needs the authorization of two of the three RCC participants, is being weighed against a backdrop of immense pressure as oil nations come together to attempt to rebalance crude markets before it's too late. Today's decision by the RCC, which has the power to mandate output cuts in the state, could result in a mandate which requires larger oil producers to cut output by 20 percent starting on the first of May.The current decline in oil prices, triggered by a geopolitical spat between two of the world's most influential oil producers, Russia and  Saudi Arabia, in addition to the demand destruction sparked by the COVID-19 pandemic, resulted in an unprecedented glut which has Texas regulators weighing the possibility of something that goes against their very grain; meddling in the free market.The meeting will come just after the historic deal reached by the Organization of the Oil Exporting Countries and its allies, referred to as OPEC+, to reduce oil production by 9.7 million barrels daily through April 2022.Big Oil Speaks OutExxon is not exactly a fan of the idea, with the company's shale boss, Staale Gjervik calling the free market \"the most efficient means of sorting out the extreme supply and demand imbalances we are now experiencing.\"Gjervik also noted that \"Proposals to impose quotas or mandatory production cuts will lead to unintended consequences for the state to the benefit of competing states in the U.S. and countries abroad.\" By Michael Kern for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

This was less than most traders expected and a lot less than the slump in demand, which could be as much as 30 million bpd. However, with cuts from non-OPEC+ partners such as Brazil, Norway, Canada, and the United States, the total reduction in supply could reach 20 million bpd.The bad news is this won't be enough. The International Energy Agency (IEA) said in its latest monthly Oil Market Report that the coronavirus outbreak has so far caused a record drop in oil demand, at 9.3 million bpd from 2019 levels. In April alone, demand fell by 29 million bpd. Over the second quarter, the IEA said, demand would recover somewhat, to 23 million bpd below 2019 levels, and then further down the road, it could recoup most of the losses, ending the year 2.7 million bpd below 2019 levels.It is clear to everyone that the cuts are necessary, but it also seems clear that they will not be enough to offset the demand decline fully. What's worse is that global oil storage is filling up, and it will continue filling up despite the cuts. This seems to be the only thing that could force additional production cuts from most, if not all, oil producers.Brazil, too, may have to cut deeper. The country was on course to a new oil boom in its presalt zone offshore when the crisis hit and persistently low prices could be the death of this oil boom. Currently, the country is producing around 3 million bpd but had plans to increase this substantially. According to OPEC's February MOMR, Brazil's production was expected to grow by 310,000 bpd in 2020.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

In the second quarter, the call on OPEC crude will be 19.73 million bpd, down by 9.6 million bpd from the demand for OPEC's oil in Q2 2019.The fewer-than-20-million-bpd demand for OPEC crude in Q2 2020 would be the lowest since 1989, the last time OPEC pumped so little crude oil, according to Bloomberg estimates.Even with the historic OPEC+ agreement to remove 9.7 million bpd from the market in May and June, OPEC alone is faced with a gaping hole between crashing demand for its oil (and for any other oil, for that matter) and still persistent oversupply, even if all OPEC members were to comply fully with their cuts--something never seen in the industry before.In the unlikely event of all OPEC members fully complying with the cuts, demand for OPEC crude in Q2 at just below 20 million bpd would still be much lower than OPEC's potential all-members-complying-100-percent production of 23.4 million bpd, according to Bloomberg estimates.  For the full-year 2020, OPEC expects demand for its crude at 24.5 million bpd, down by 5.4 million bpd compared to 2019. When compared with the same quarters in 2019, demand for OPEC crude in Q1 2020 and Q2 2020 is expected to be 8.2 million bpd and 9.6 million bpd lower, respectively, the cartel said in its monthly report. Those projections, however, remain \"heavily subject to uncertainty surrounding current market conditions,\" OPEC said.  As far as the entire global oil demand is concerned, OPEC expects it to drop by 6.8 million bpd this year, as \"The oil market is currently undergoing historic shock that is abrupt, extreme and at global scale.\"                                           By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "A Montana judge canceled a vital permit for the controversial Keystone XL oil pipeline with the argument that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers failed to consider the effects of the pipeline on one fish species present in rivers that the route of the Keystone XL would cross.The cancellation comes just days after work on the construction of the pipeline began after two years of setbacks. Bloomberg reported last week that construction works had started on the Canadian part of the pipeline amid calls from opponents to delay the start because of the coronavirus outbreak.These construction works will not stop due to Judge Brian Morris's ruling, the AP notes in a report on the news. However, it will delay work on the U.S. side of the border, perhaps indefinitely.\"It creates another significant hurdle for the project,\" said a representative of one of the organizations opposing the Keystone XL. \"Regardless of whether they have the cross border segment ... Keystone XL has basically lost all of its Clean Water Act permits for water crossings.\"The Canadian National Energy Board approved the start of preliminary work on the Keystone XL pipeline in January last year, but U.S. opposition has been strong and relentless.The pipeline, vetoed by President Obama and then given the green light by President Trump, was planned to carry heavy oil from Alberta to U.S. refineries. The 830,000 bpd pipeline will run from the Albertan oil sands through Montana and South Dakota, ending in Nebraska, where it will connect to the existing pipeline network that goes on to the Gulf Coast.A lot of the opposition to the project--and the reason President Obama vetoed it--was that it was believed to be unnecessary for the U.S. energy sector. It was, however, vital for the Canadian energy sector, which has been struggling with a pipeline shortage for several years now.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Enterprise Products Partners is opening the northbound capacity of its Seaway pipeline, offering U.S. oil producers struggling to place their oil near the Gulf Coast to ship their barrels to the primary storage hub at Cushing, Oklahoma.   \"Given the current turmoil in the crude oil market, including impacts on both refinery and export demand, there is strong market interest to access the Cushing storage market,\" the pipeline operator said in a filing with the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) this week, as carried by Reuters.  The Gulf Coast-Cushing oil flow would have been an unusual occurrence just a year ago when the Seaway pipeline was mostly carrying oil in the other direction-from the inland to the U.S. Gulf Coast refineries and export terminals. The Seaway pipeline was expanded with a southbound flow from Cushing to the Gulf Coast in 2012 when rising U.S. production meant more oil needed to the carried from the oilfields to the coast and major refineries there.But this year, the massive oil demand drop in the U.S. and overseas due to lockdowns in the COVID-19 pandemic has had U.S. oil producers scrambling to find storage for their produced barrels when no one wants more oil right now.Enterprise Products Partners is now offering the unused capacity on its pipeline system from Fort Bend County, Texas, to Cushing. Oil could also flow south to the Gulf area, a company spokesman told Reuters in a statement.The U.S. Department of Energy is also trying to help U.S. oil producers with finding storage for their unwanted oil. The DOE said on Tuesday that it was negotiating contracts with nine U.S. oil producers to store a total of 23 million barrels of their produced oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), to help U.S. oil producers with storage availability amid the huge demand loss from the pandemic.

The company is the world's fourth-largest wind energy producer, and nearly 66 percent of its energy is produced from renewable sources, it says on its website.This is not the first time an energy company has been held to ransom by cyber attackers.At the end of last year, Mexico's state oil firm Pemex was hit by a ransomware attack, which caused administrative operations at the company to grind to a halt, but work was restored soon after.The incident highlighted once again the growing importance of cybersecurity in the oil and gas industry and all its critical infrastructure across the globe. Pemex has no intention of paying the ransom that cyber attackers have requested, Mexico's Energy Minister and Pemex board chair Rocio Nahle said a day later after the ransomware attack. The attackers had demanded they be paid US$5 million in ransom in bitcoin, according to various media reports at the time. At the beginning of this year, industrial cybersecurity firm Dragos said in a new report that threats of cyber attacks on North America's electric network systems are growing. Dragos said it had identified two groups, Magnallium and Xenotime, which are increasingly probing to compromise electric assets in North America, expanding their targeting from the oil and gas sector to include electric assets.

        "content": "While Mexico's leftist President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador wants to make state oil firm Pemex the pillar of a turnaround in the country's declining oil production, hundreds of Pemex workers haven't been paid for months and haven't had health insurance and vacation days covered, Quartz reported on Wednesday, citing former and current employees at the company.The workers were hired as contractors for Lopez Obrador's flagship Pemex revival project--the construction of an US$8-billion Dos Bocas refinery in his home state of Tabasco. Pemex is the company working on the refinery project, a key campaign pledge of populist leftist President Lopez Obrador who promised to reduce Mexico's reliance on fuel and refined product imports, most of which come from the United States.  Lopez Obrador's 'Mexico First' energy policy agenda turned last week's OPEC+ meeting into a Mexican soap opera after Mexico, part of the non-OPEC producers in the OPEC+ group, disagreed with proposals that it should reduce its production by 400,000 bpd from its October 2018 baseline, offering only a 100,000-bpd cut.The fact that Mexico's oil hedge protects it from the oil price crash - which hurts other OPEC+ countries much more - was said to be one of the reasons why Mexico dug in its heels and refused to cut its production as much as its OPEC+ partners asked it to.But while Lopez Obrador touts a win at the OPEC+ negotiations, sources among ex Pemex employees and executives tell Quartz's geopolitics reporter Max de Haldevang that the state oil firm had not paid some of its contract workers since December 2019.\"Unfortunately, the current administration's attitude towards workers is not what I would have hoped from a leftist government,\" a former Pemex board member told Quartz. Other current and former employees say that the firm hasn't taken adequate steps to ensure social distancing and protective gear such as masks and gloves for workers on the sites.Premium: There Is Still Hope For Oil PricesIn addition, Pemex is months behind in payments to contractor firms, including to those working on the Dos Bocas refinery project, David Enriquez, energy lawyer at law firm Goodrich, Riquelme y Associados told Quartz.Pemex's financial situation is difficult and is set to become even more difficult with the oil price crash, Fitch Ratings said earlier this month, downgrading the company deeper into junk territory.The company's stand-alone credit profile is deteriorating because of its \"limited flexibility to navigate the downturn in the oil and gas industry given its elevated tax burden, high leverage, rising per barrel lifting costs and high investment needs to maintain production and replenish reserves,\" the rating agency said.\"At the current Mexico's crude basket price of below $20/bbl, PEMEX's upstream business does not generate enough cash flow to cover operational and financial costs (half-cycle costs) of more than $25/bbl and the company will need extraordinary government support in the immediate future,\" Fitch noted.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

Sitting at $4.71 at the time of writing, WCS is facing a nightmare scenario.Fortunately for Alberta, Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said this month that the government was scrambling to secure an aid package for the country's oil sector. And though the help has been slow to come, it seems the administration is now closer than ever to providing some relief for the ailing industry. \"We recognize that the most important thing from the very beginning was to get help out to Canadians right across the country, regardless of the sectors they're in, regardless of their situation or their location,\" the prime minister said.And some relief has come. Not only have OPEC and a slew of other oil producers across the globe agreed upon a massive 9.7 million barrel per day cut in oil production, but the Canadian government has also been making some attempts to prop up the industry. In Saskatchewan, mineral rights have been extended until 2021, allowing more time for producers to plan since holding onto those titles typically means drilling a well - which in this environment, is currently out of the question.Warren Waldegger, the president and CEO of Fire Sky Energy, noted that \"An extra year on some of those leases...hopefully will lead to future drilling activity.\" Alberta too has seen some relief, with a $100 million loan to the Orphan Well Association to begin the reclamation and abandonment of up to 1000 more wells. Additionally, the government noted that it will enact important reforms under Bill 12 of the Oil & Gas Conservation Act, allowing the Orphan Well Association to sell oil from orphan wells to associated pipelines. But whether or not the government is doing enough to support the industry through this crisis remains unclear. The mega-relief package that Finance Minister Bill Morneau touted was only \"hours away\" a few weeks ago still hasn't come.By Michael Kern for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com: "

        "content": "Due to the oil price crash and the nature of Russia's tax system, the budget of the Russian Federation is set to suffer from low oil revenues despite Sunday's OPEC+ agreement for a massive collective production cut of nearly 10 million bpd.  Due to the monthly recalculation of Russia's oil export duty based on the average price of its key export grade, Urals, for the previous month, Russia's oil export duty in May is about to be 87 percent lower than in April, Bloomberg reported on Thursday.According to Bloomberg estimates on data from the Russian finance ministry, Moscow would be getting less than US$1 out of each barrel of Urals it exports.This ultra-low oil export duty is the lowest in 18 years--since 2002--when the export duty mechanism was introduced, a finance ministry official told Bloomberg.The price of Urals averaged around US$19 a barrel between the middle of March and the middle of April, the period for which data is collected to recalculate the export duty for oil in the next one-month period, according to data from the Russian finance ministry.Related: Oil Prices Sink On Record Breaking 19.2 Million Barrel Crude BuildOn the face of it, Russia agreed to much deeper cuts in Sunday's deal than those it rejected in early March when Russia's refusal to back a collective 1.5 million bpd OPEC+ cut led to the one-month spat and the oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia. In reality, cheating with quotas has been an art in Russia since the start of the OPEC+ alliance more than three years ago.   In the new deal, which lacks clear mechanisms for compliance observance, Russia's target for oil production is 8.5 million bpd in May and June, Vitaly Yermakov and James Henderson of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies wrote in a paper earlier this week. However, it's not clear if condensate is included, which changes Russia's overall cut. Including condensate, Russia's share of the cuts should be 2.8 million bpd, without condensate, the cut would be around 2 million bpd, according to the authors.\"[I]t will be important to monitor compliance, especially as there is only a three-week period before around 20% of Russian oil production needs to be temporarily shut down. We suspect that this may be a task that is very difficult to achieve but would not underestimate the ingenuity of the Russian oil industry and the Kremlin to at least make a case for compliance by May,\" they said.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

Genel Energy, which has interests in three producing fields in the Kurdistan Region - Taq Taq, Tawke, and Peshkabir - has received payment for the oil sales in March 2020, the company said today. Yet, the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) had proposed to Genel Energy to defer the payments due for the period between November last year and February this year, interest-free, for at least nine months.\"Should the oil price recover to c.$50/bbl, a payment programme to recover the deferred invoices will be put in place,\" Genel Energy said.\"Genel welcomes the KRG's approach to establish a framework that provides clarity and predictability for overdue and future payments, and the commitment to full repayment of deferred invoices as the oil price recovers,\" the company added.According to RBC analysts, cited by Reuters, the deferred payments are worth a total of around $300 million, of which another company operating in Kurdistan, DNO, is entitled to three-quarters of those payments. Genel will get the rest.Iraq and Kurdistan are struggling to pay the companies extracting their oil as crude prices have crashed by 60 percent since the beginning of the year, crippling oil revenues that are vital for both Iraq and the Kurdistan region.Iraq, which relies on oil revenues for 95 percent of its budgetary income, is one of the least diversified economies in the Middle East. The federal government saw its revenues cut nearly in half in March when oil prices collapsed, even though OPEC's second-largest producer exported more barrels of crude last month than it did in February. Kurdistan is included in Iraq's commitment to reduce oil production as part of the new OPEC+ deal, Iraqi Oil Minister Thamer al-Ghadhban said earlier this week.

China has territorial claims to about 90 percent of the South China Sea, which has put it at odds with its neighbors. The Chinese research and survey vessel Haiyang Dizhi 8 was close to Malaysian waters, and at one point on Friday, the Chinese ship was flanked by Chinese ships of the coast guard and maritime militia, according to Reuters' sources. The Haiyang Dizhi 8 ship was close to the West Capella exploration vessel operated by Petronas.The same Chinese ship was spotted off Vietnam's waters earlier this week, and moving closer to Malaysia, according to ship-tracking data cited by Reuters on Thursday.At the end of last year, the Chinese and Philippine foreign ministers sealed an agreement for the two countries to pursue joint oil and gas exploration in the South China Sea. The talks between the two countries on the South China Sea's oil and gas potential and how to exploit it had been going on for years. An agreement has proved challenging to reach, however, mostly because of China's territorial claims to the basin, which cover nearly the entirety of it.But tensions in the South China Sea have increased in recent weeks. Last week, the U.S. State Department said, commenting on reports that China had sunk a Vietnamese fishing vessel in the South China Sea:\"We call on the PRC to remain focused on supporting international efforts to combat the global pandemic, and to stop exploiting the distraction or vulnerability of other states to expand its unlawful claims in the South China Sea.\" By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

That's despite the president's decision to suspend all new bidding rounds and review all contracts with foreign oil companies signed by the previous government.In an interview with Reuters, the head of the National Hydrocarbons Commission, Rogelio Hernandez, said, regarding the joint ventures, \"I think it will happen during this government. In fact, I see it as imminent.\"The Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador government announced the suspension of all oil field exploration and development contracts last year, as it began to review these contracts for signs of corruption by the previous government. At the same time, the Lopez Obrador administration shelved all planned oil and gas auctions for the duration of the contract review.According to Hernandez, Pemex has a portfolio of more than 350 projects, and of these, some 100 could be farmed out to partners because if Pemex does not start developing them, the assets will revert to the state.The process may be coming to an end now, or maybe the government has found that Pemex will be hard-pressed to develop all the priority fields the government identified last year for development. The Lopez Obrador administration plans to increase oil production by 50 percent by the end of the president's term in office.This plan will have to be delayed temporarily, as Mexico agreed to cut 100,000 bpd from its average daily to support efforts by OPEC+ and other oil producers to prop up international oil prices. However, Pemex still seems to be sticking to plans for drilling 423 new wells this year and accelerate the development of 15 discoveries, even though, according to some energy experts, more than half of the country's oil production is unprofitable at oil prices of $30 per barrel.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

The ironic situation is the result of two oversights, the first of which was that most of the LNG production capacity that came on stream in the last few years was directed abroad.As the International Energy Agency said in 2018, \"Increasing LNG exports have created a tight supply in Australia's eastern market, which is characterized by weak regulation, poor transparency and low liquidity. Market inefficiencies need to be addressed swiftly and transparency improved rapidly for domestic consumption and LNG exports to successfully coexist.\"Queensland is particularly vulnerable: the state is a major LNG producer, but the resources are running out, and according to one local consultancy, it would be forced to shut down 33 percent of its LNG production capacity because of resource depletion by 2025.According to Shell, its Arrow Energy venture already produces 140 million cu ft daily, which is sufficient to meet some 40 percent of Queensland's natural gas demand, equal to a tenth of total gas demand on the country's east coast.The Arrow Energy venture was approved by the Queensland authorities in February last year, likely with a sigh of relief.

It's forced people into their homes, cratered the markets and has lead to tens of millions of lost jobs. In the clean energy industry alone, over 100,000 jobs were lost in March. And it's likely to get much worse.A recent report from Environmental Entrepreneurs (E2) revealed that there were 106,000 unemployment claims filed by clean energy workers in the month of March, with 69,800 claims coming from the energy efficiency industry, 16,500 coming from the renewable energy industry, 12,300 from the clean vehicles industry, and 7,700 from grids, storage, and clean fuels.The wave of layoffs in March is just the beginning, according to the study. Demand for energy has plummeted, and the nationwide lockdown orders If no action is taken by Congress, as much as 500,000 jobs could be lost within the clean energy sector by the end of June.E2 executive director Bob Keefe noted, \"It's a huge and important part of our economy,\" adding, \"Anything that Congress does to get our economy back on its feet and to get America working again should absolutely include a focus on an industry of that size.\"In addition to immediate support from lawmakers, advocates are also calling on Congress to use the industry to help rebuild the economy as it did following the economic crisis of 2008 with the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.The E2 report proposes a program that includes $30-90 billion in spending to improve grids to prepare for an extensive renewable energy deployment program which will incorporate a nationwide electric vehicle charging network and building electrification program. Additionally, its plan adds increased funding to the Department of Energy research and development programs.Keefe explained, \"Why can't we get some of the 150,000 or so people who work in grid modernization at utilities and in energy storage out there upgrading our ancient power grid in America?\" Adding \"You can do some pretty good social distancing when you're a couple hundred feet up on a power line somewhere.\"By Michael Kern for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

But the coronavirus, which stripped away demand, and overzealous production by OPEC have both lowered the price of oil and filled oil storage to the brim.The result? Rystad has lowered its projected change in output for the year by 2.15 million barrels per day. Additionally, it cautioned that this figure may \"slide even further\".So instead of shale production increasing by 650,000 bpd, Rystad is now expecting production to decrease by 1.5 million bpd by the end of 2020.Rystad's projections were released on Thursday and come in the same week as the Energy Information Administration's Drilling Productivity Report forecast that U.S. shale production in the seven most prolific basins for April is expected to fall by a record amount--193,625 bpd. The EIA expects this production to fall again in May by another 182,673 bpd.According to the EIA's DPR, U.S. shale production has fallen by 546,622 bpd since December 2019.The largest loss will come from the Permian Basin, the EIA's report showed.West Texas Intermediate (WTI) was trading below $20 per barrel on Thursday afternoon, down 0.60% at $19.75.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "title": "Can A Trillion New Trees Really Combat Climate Change?",
        "content": "Last month I discussed the announcement by Jeff Bezos, founder, president and CEO of Amazon -- that he would commit $10 billion toward fighting climate change.The money would be used to establish the Bezos Earth Fund, which would \"fund scientists, activists, NGOs -- any effort that offers a real possibility to help preserve and protect the natural world.\"As I discussed previously, there are two big targets in this fight: Reducing ongoing CO2 emissions, and removing CO2 that is already in the atmosphere.I mentioned the potential for trees as an efficient way of removing atmospheric CO2. Vegetation takes atmospheric CO2 and converts it through photosynthesis into biomass. But it's a slow process, and it doesn't permanently sequester the CO2. Eventually, most of the biomass once again becomes CO2.I was subsequently contacted by multiple people who wanted to share more information about the potential to use trees for atmospheric carbon sequestration. Today I want to share some thoughts with one of these people. I plan to share more thoughts on this next week.Planting enough trees to make an impact would have to be an extensive effort, but there are already ambitious efforts underway, such as the Trillion Tree Campaign. A massive campaign of tree planting could remove CO2 from the atmosphere and at least bind it up for decades. It's not a permanent solution, but it buys time.For context, at 200 trees per acre, this would require an estimated 7.8 million square miles, more than double the size of the continental U.S. at 3.1 million square miles. This becomes a challenge considering the competing uses for land around the world.But there is also enormous potential for managed forests to sequester a great deal of carbon. This is essentially tree farming, where trees are planted, grown, and replanted. This should not be confused with clearcutting old-growth forest, which has many negative environmental implications (well beyond just a net release of CO2 into the atmosphere).In order to explore the potential of managed forest, I recently spoke with Professor Indroneil Ganguly, who is an Associate Professor and Associate Director at the Center for International Trade in Forest Products at the University of Washington.Professor Ganguly's research involves wood products and managed forest - with a focus on sustainable forestry. One of the interesting projects he has recently been involved in is taking softwood slash from forestry operations and converting it to kerosene (Jet-A equivalent). The process he worked on extracts sugars from woodchips and is similar to pulping except it does not remove the lignin. The sugars are converted to alcohol, and then to jet fuel.We spoke at length about issues around carbon sequestration and managed forests.He explained that trees sequester carbon at the highest rate when they are relatively younger. It depends on the species, but they generally sequester intensively during the growth phase. In Pacific Northwest forests, Douglas fir sequesters most rapidly between the ages of 15-35 years. The growth rate increases at an increasing rate, during this period, before slowing down.Premium: Missiles Fired In Iraq As Proxy War Heats UpA recent paper demonstrated that the only forest type in the Pacific Northwest that has net negative carbon sequestration (i.e., it gives off more carbon dioxide than it consumes) is US Forest Service reserve forest (like national parks). Although trees are still sequestering carbon, they are also dying at a higher rate. All other forest types in the Pacific Northwest are net positive in carbon sequestration throughout their lives.I asked about how much of the sequestered carbon remains underground after the harvest. He explained that softwoods will sequester 30-35% below ground in the stump and root system.When I asked about how long this carbon remains in the ground, he said there is a great deal of uncertainty around this question. Although the carbon level in the soil remains relatively constant over time - which would imply that all the CO2 absorbed during the growth phase is ultimately released over time - he said that isn't necessarily the case.There is a theory that the soil carbon leeches somewhere we don't yet understand. There aren't enough studies that show where the carbon is going. Most studies only look at carbon levels in the first five feet of soil depth. It could be that the carbon is leeching into the wetlands or remains in the deep soil. In that case, the underground carbon could lead to long-term sequestration.He told me that afforestation (the artificial establishment of forests by planting or seeding in an area of non-forest land) is one of the best things we can do to sequester atmospheric CO2. Take land and try to grow trees on the land.The challenge there is that land supply is limited, and the forestry sector is losing ground to urban development and agriculture.But he also explained that we can intensify our forest management and better manage it to sequester more carbon. An average managed forest sequesters 5-8 tons of carbon dioxide equivalents per acre per year. This level can range from 1 to 20 tons per acre per year, depending on factors including age of the plantation, species, soil type etc. For less intensively managed forests, that can drop to 3-5 tons. So, intensification in forest management is a path, but that also depends on the quality of the land.One way to sequester carbon faster is to do a shorter rotation on the forests, but that impacts the quality of the biomass. But not too short, or you harvest trees too early, when they are still sequestering carbon at an increasing rate. This can be true for specialty species like hybrid poplar.If the tree grows for longer, you get better-quality wood. High-quality wood can be used for structural material, which can then sequester the carbon for much longer. The real goal is to make wood products that are longer living.He explained that old houses are almost like a forest, so we want to make sure wood that goes into these structures is of high quality. Importantly, after 40 years, about 50% of the lumber that we produce is still in the economy in its functional form. That means that this carbon is truly being sequestered for decades.If we can mitigate climate change by removing carbon from the atmosphere and sequester it for decades, that's certainly something that warrants the attention of Jeff Bezos's fund.By Robert Rapier More Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

Qatar shares the North Field with Iran, which calls the deposit the South Pars. While Qatar announced this week the start of its development drilling to expand its natural gas export capacity and reclaim the world's top liquefied natural gas (LNG) exporter spot, Iran - hit by strict U.S. sanctions and the coronavirus pandemic - says it still has plans for the next phase of the South Pars field, but drilling won't take place until March 2021.The first offshore well of South Pars Phase 11 project will be drilled in the current Iranian calendar year which began on March 20 and ends in March 2021, Iran's Oil Minister Bijan Zangeneh said on Wednesday, as quoted by Iran's oil ministry's news service, Shana.Qatar, for its part, has launched drilling for the first phase of the North Field expansion. The first well out of 80 planned was spudded on March 29, Qatar Petroleum said in a statement.Qatar had previously put a moratorium on any production expansion at the field, but two years ago, it took many market players by surprise when it announced its plan to ramp up production. That decision was made as Australia began challenging--successfully--Qatar's number-one position as the world's largest LNG exporter. Qatar has announced plans to increase its LNG production capacity by 43 percent--from 77 million tons annually now to 110 million tons a year. The new export capacity includes expansion projects set to be completed in 2024.  The first phase of the North Field expansion project will increase Qatar's LNG production capacity from 77 million tons per annum (Mtpa) to 110 Mtpa. The second phase of the expansion project, called the North Field South Project (NFS), is set to further boost Qatar's LNG production capacity from 110 Mtpa to 126 Mtpa, Qatar Petroleum says.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Oil supermajor Shell announced on Thursday its ambition to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 at the latest, joining other majors such as BP and Eni in unveiling plans to curb carbon emissions.Shell will be working with its customers to address the emissions which are produced when they use the fuels they buy from Shell, the supermajor said.\"Society's expectations have shifted quickly in the debate around climate change. Shell now needs to go further with our own ambitions, which is why we aim to be a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 or sooner. Society, and our customers, expect nothing less,\" Shell's chief executive Ben van Beurden said, adding that even at the times of immediate challenge such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the company should not lose focus on the long term.Over the past two months, BP and Eni have also announced targets to cut emissions.In February, before the oil price crash, BP said it would aim to become a net-zero company by 2050 or sooner, but it drew criticism over the lack of specifics about how it would achieve its goal.Italy's Eni also said in February that it expects its oil production to start declining after 2025 as part of a new long-term strategy to rely on natural gas, renewables, and new technologies to cut net greenhouse gas emissions of its energy products by 80 percent by 2050. Shell has been setting carbon footprint targets in the past few years, but today's plan is one of the most ambitious in terms of net-zero commitments in the industry.Related: Trump Threatens \"Very Substantial\" Tariffs On Oil ImportsThe world needs to get to the point at which it will no longer add to the stock of greenhouse gases, and reducing emissions to net zero \"is the only way to go,\" van Beurden said last summer, calling on businesses to work together to move faster in addressing climate change. While the Church of England Pensions Board and Robeco, co-lead as part of the Climate Action 100+ dialogue with Shell, welcomed Shell's latest commitment, Teresa Anderson, climate policy coordinator at ActionAid International, said that \"The 'net' of 'net zero' is a giant loophole that fossil fuel companies are using to avoid scrutiny.\" \"We mustn't let corporate greenwash or the COVID-19 pandemic distract us from the real and urgent transformation needed to avoid runaway climate change,\" ActionAid said.

The lost investment will be mostly concentrated in the years after 2022, said IHS Markit's Senior Associate for the Energy Cost and Technology team, Renata Machado, and Marcos Lepore, Research Analyst for Oil and Gas Markets.Demand for offshore equipment and services is set to drop by an average of 14 percent through 2025, according to the analysts.\"Pemex, facing financial and operational problems, is already suffering from delays in its projects, and more are to come,\" they noted.Pemex's financial situation is precarious, and it is set to become even more difficult with the oil price crash, Fitch Ratings said earlier this month, downgrading the company deeper into junk territory.The company's stand-alone credit profile is deteriorating because of its \"limited flexibility to navigate the downturn in the oil and gas industry given its elevated tax burden, high leverage, rising per barrel lifting costs and high investment needs to maintain production and replenish reserves,\" the rating agency said.\"At the current Mexico's crude basket price of below $20/bbl, PEMEX's upstream business does not generate enough cash flow to cover operational and financial costs (half-cycle costs) of more than $25/bbl and the company will need extraordinary government support in the immediate future,\" Fitch noted.

The U.S. Department of Energy is already trying to help U.S. oil producers with finding storage for their unwanted oil. The DOE said last week that it was negotiating contracts with nine U.S. oil producers to store a total of 23 million barrels of their produced oil in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) to help U.S. oil producers with storage availability amid the colossal demand loss from the pandemic.   U.S. oil producers are struggling to turn a profit at prices below $40 a barrel, but the massive demand loss in the pandemic and the lockdowns that followed have been pressuring prices for weeks.

USO, one of the most popular oil-tracking ETFs for retail investors, was one of the reasons for the historic decline in May WTI futures on Monday. The reason? Because the futures contract expires on Tuesday.Bloomberg sources suggest that as of last week, the USO held 25 percent of the outstanding shares of May 2020 WTI oil futures. But that contract ends on Tuesday. Buyers of these contracts must either sell these contracts for oil now or take physical delivery of the oil at the end of May. Of course, an ETF like the USO who deals in paper barrels is not eager to take physical delivery of any amount of oil - even if they could find somewhere to store it.Before the announcement from USO, trade in the fund was halted and it was down by 20 percent pre-market on Tuesday.Pierre Andurand, a well-known energy trader, warned traders on Tuesday of massive losses in ETFs.\"I think the CME might have no other choice but to close out the ETFs positions.

Meanwhile, major companies, including ExxonMobil and pipeline operators, expressed opinions that the regulators should let the free market dictate the production in the state.Smaller independent producers tend to support some kind of coordinated action to restrict supply, arguing that the free market will wipe out the smaller guys in the industry.Enterprise Products Partners Co-CEO Jim Teague, for his part, told the Commissioners in his testimony, as carried by CBS7:\"Do you really think that a cut by Texas can fill a 25 million barrel demand hole?\"  Today's meeting of the Texas Railroad Commission comes just a week after the previous one. Still, the market circumstances and sentiment are so much more dire this time, with WTI Crude oil prices sinking into negative territory for the first time in a 300% price crash on Monday. While the price collapse was driven by the expiry of the May futures contract today with traders running for the exit to avoid getting stuck with holding actual physical barrels for delivery with no place to store oil, the sentiment has spread to Brent Crude prices today, which plunged by 20% to $20 a barrel early on Tuesday.Commenting on Monday's WTI Crude price crash, Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar said in a statement:\"Today's market activity was unprecedented and likely indicative of very limited storage capacity. May contracts traded well into negative territory as the market prepares to shift focus to June contracts.\"\"While this unprecedented volatility is concerning, the greater impact to Texas will come if demand remains historically low for a prolonged period of time and supply gluts continue to strain storage capacity,\" Hegar said.  \"A key question is whether we could see a repeat of this with the June expiry next month. It is likely that storage this time next month will be even more of an issue, given the surplus environment, and so in the absence of a meaningful demand recovery, negative prices could return for June,\" ING strategists Warren Patterson and Wenyu Yao said on Tuesday.

Some analysts have estimated that this shift would cost tens of trillions of dollars.Oil prices turned negative yesterday, with West Texas Intermediate falling below minus $37 a barrel as traders scrambled to ditch their May delivery oil contracts to avoid actual delivery that would have come at a steep cost as free storage space shrinks.However, Ocasio-Cortez's joy at this price development may be both ill-timed and misguided. As Senator Ted Cruz tweeted in response, \"Which part of the millions of blue-collar workers losing their jobs & small refineries closing their doors forever is what you 'love to see' (per your deleted tweet) @AOC? Asking for those in Texas & across USA whose livelihoods (ability to put food on the table) are AT RISK.\"Premium: Oil Storage Nears Its LimitBut job loss aside, Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez appears to be confused about the relationship between the fossil fuel industry and the renewable energy industry. The nature of this relationship is striking: when oil is cheap, renewable energy reaps no benefits because consumption of the cheap commodity increases.Granted, right now, we are in a unique situation when oil is cheap because there is no demand for it and the supply is too high. However, demand for electricity, including from renewable sources, is also down because of the lockdowns. Solar and wind industry representatives even warned of massive job losses in their industry because of the pandemic. In other words, the renewable energy industry is also in trouble--it's not just bad old oil.

        "title": "COVID-19 Could Kill China's $3.8 Trillion New Silk Road",
        "content": "The BRI is a far-reaching plan for transnational infrastructure development, linking five continents through land and sea corridors and industrial clusters.Launched in 2013, it was initially planned to revive ancient Silk Road trade routes between Eurasia and China, but the scope of the BRI has since extended to cover 138 countries, including 38 in sub-Saharan Africa and 18 in Latin America and the Caribbean. Prior to the pandemic, the Asian Development Bank estimated that the infrastructure financing needs of emerging Asia alone would amount to $26trn through 2030. It is thus unsurprising that many low- and middle-income countries came to see the BRI as a vehicle for catalysing much-needed investment in capital projects.By early January 2020, 2951 BRI-linked projects valued at $3.87trn were planned or underway across the world.Although the criteria for what actually constitutes a BRI project are not formally defined, linking a project to the BRI through a memorandum of understanding (MoU) or another agreement provides access to finance from Chinese policy banks and specialist funds, as well as connections to Chinese contractors and suppliers eager to make use of their excess capacity.  However, as borders began to close in response to the pandemic, and governments shuttered non-essential industries and asked citizens to stay at home, progress stalled on a number of major BRI developments. Restrictions on the flow of Chinese workers and construction supplies have been cited as factors for project suspensions or slowdowns in Pakistan, Cambodia, Indonesia, Myanmar and Malaysia.  \"Some BRI projects are in poorer nations, which may require medical and health care assistance to be a priority ahead of continuing infrastructure projects, and this will vary from country to country,\" Chris Devonshire-Ellis, founding partner of Dezan Shira & Associates, told OBG.Taking into account that Covid-19 originated in Wuhan, China, late last year, the use of large numbers of Chinese construction workers on BRI projects has become a contentious issue in some nations, even though China has been relatively successful at containing the spread of the coronavirus within its borders.\"These factors require a considered approach and this will lead to delays in the resumption of projects. However, these issues will be resolved in time,\" Devonshire-Ellis added.       In many of the markets that constitute the 'yellow slice' of the global economic pie - those dynamic emerging economies that form part of the OBG portfolio - big-ticket BRI projects have been a major driver of infrastructure development in recent years.For example, Egypt is ranked in the Refinitiv BRI Database as the country with the second-highest number of BRI-linked projects by volume after Russia, with 109 under construction or in the pipeline. It also has the seventh-highest cumulative value of BRI-linked projects (almost $100bn).Saudi Arabia has emerged as the country with the fourth-highest number of BRI-linked projects by volume (106) and second-highest by value ($195.7bn). Malaysia, Indonesia and the UAE also make the top-10 rankings for both project volume and value.   Major BRI-linked projects under way or in the pipeline in those countries include the 950-megawatt Noor Energy 1 solar power plant in Dubai; the $6bn high-speed rail line between Jakarta and Bandung in Indonesia; and the China-Egypt TEDA Suez Economic and Trade Cooperation Zone.Elsewhere, BRI projects underpin the major infrastructure pipeline for some developing states.For example, in Myanmar, a lower-middle income economy, 33 bilateral agreements were signed in January for the acceleration of the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor (CMEC), which falls under the BRI umbrella. Projects planned as part of the CMEC include rail links and a deep-water port at Kyaukpyu, which will provide a strategic connection between China's south-west and the Indian Ocean.One criticism sometimes levelled at the BRI is that developing economies risk unsustainable debt burdens for projects that are not necessarily in their national interest.For example, in December 2017 Sri Lanka formerly ceded 70% control of Hambantota Port to a Chinese state-owned firm on a 99-year lease as it was unable to service loans used to build the $1.3bn strategic gateway on the Indian Ocean.Perhaps mindful of this example, in 2018 Myanmar renegotiated the cost of the Kyaukpyu deep-water port project down from $7.3bn to $1.3bn, with some Myanmar officials concerned that the project disproportionately served China's energy, trade and security interests. However, as the coronavirus-induced economic slowdown threatens to increase the debt burdens on developing economies, and places China itself under added fiscal pressure, Chinese loans linked to BRI projects are once again in the spotlight.Bilateral loans made by Chinese state-owned institutions to foreign partners have increased in tandem with the proliferation of BRI projects across the world. According to a March 2020 report in the Wall Street Journal, some $200bn in emerging market debt owed to China has not been reported in official figures. Much of this undisclosed debt was traced by researchers to BRI projects.Meanwhile, a 2019 study by the Germany-based Kiel Institute for the World Economy found China was the world's largest bilateral creditor, and that the combined debt owed to China by 50 developing countries had grown from an average of 1% of their GDP in 2015 to 15% by 2017.Unlike multilateral institutions, direct loans from China's policy banks are often extended at commercial rates and secured against collateral such as oil or other commodities.With so many emerging economies now appealing to bilateral creditors and multilateral finance institutions for debt relief and restructuring, it remains to be seen how China will respond.In the past, China has preferred to conduct debt renegotiations on a private, government-to-government basis. However, it was seemingly included in a G20 agreement for a temporary moratorium on debt repayments from the world's least developed countries to bilateral creditors, which was announced on April 15.   The example of Myanmar's Kyaukpyu port - as well as the 2019 renegotiation of Malaysia's East Coast Rail Link, which reduced the cost by one third - should provide further hope to countries signed up to the BRI who may now be re-evaluating costs and benefits. With China's economy contracting in the first quarter of 2020 for the first time in decades amid rising unemployment claims at home, Chinese capital resources are likely to be mobilised to meet domestic needs in the short term, which could translate into reduced investment in the BRI's more peripheral markets over the next 12 to 24 months. Premium: 2 Stocks To Consider As Oil Falls Into The NegativesCombined with the fact that many of the countries signed up to BRI projects face escalating foreign debt pressures, the stage may be set for a long-term reorientation towards more strategic and cost-efficient infrastructure projects, which meet clearly defined domestic or regional demand, and rely less on opaque loans from Chinese policy banks. BRI projects in the pipeline could be made more open to varied financing options involving multiple stakeholders, such as multilateral institutions, foreign banks, private equity and green bonds. This could help to spread financial risks and promote greater levels of transparency, efficiency and innovation.    Some of China's neighbours and financing institutions active in Asia are well-positioned to play a greater role in BRI projects. For example, Singapore has the technical and financial ecosystem necessary for structuring, funding and executing major infrastructure projects in South-east Asia, as well linguistic and cultural ties to China that should make it an attractive partner.   Even before the pandemic, private financing and co-financing had been playing a growing role in BRI projects.Efforts have been to adopt formal lending rules similar to those of multilateral development banks (MDBs), and in March 2019 China's Ministry of Finance signed an MoU with several MDBs to establish a Multilateral Cooperation Centre for Development Finance.As of December 31 last year, project financing was the main source of funds for 676 out of 1015 projects analysed in the Refinitiv BRI Database. Private sector finance accounted for 20.5% of the total funding for all projects in the database, while publicly listed firms contributed 6.8%.However, these totals are still significantly less than the 46.1% of finance attributed to government institutions.\"China was increasingly open to the multilateralisation of the BRI prior to the pandemic and that will no doubt continue, with capital from multilateral institutions and private sources needed for certain projects to be sustainable,\" Parag Khanna, Founder and Managing Partner of FutureMap, told OBG.However, Khanna, author of the book The Future is Asian, does not believe China's domestic obligations will detract attention from the BRI.  Premium: The Oil Sector That Will Suffer The Most\"The BRI will not lose importance for China, because it is a significant portion of its grand strategy. Much as we see China continuing its military doctrine of probing for opportunities, it will still seek to use BRI as an umbrella for increasing its geographic connectivity, supply chain efficiency and commercial leverage with key states in Asia, the Middle East, and beyond,\" he added.Beyond the BRI, the infrastructure industry in general is grappling with severe challenges as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.  These include external financing bottlenecks, difficulties in mobilising consultants and contractors, delays in government approvals and permissions, and slowdowns in productivity related to remote working, according to Allard Nooy, CEO of InfraCo Asia, a donor-funded, commercially managed infrastructure development firm.Due to constraints on the movement of construction equipment and materials, the crisis is also highlighting the need for logistics and supply chain diversification for better crisis management. There are indications that many Chinese manufacturers serving the construction industry have begun to cultivate alternative supply chains in South-east Asia.    Notwithstanding physical disruption to the infrastructure sector, much preparation work can still be performed online, allowing some progress to be made on certain projects.  Promisingly, such projects include many that form part of the so-called green economy, which could emerge as a sustainable, high-growth segment as policymakers seek long-term recovery strategies.   \"Support for renewables in the pipeline appears strong, perhaps because such projects typically face relatively fewer construction issues and also tend to have a more straightforward revenue structure than other types of infrastructure. This allows for easier credit assessment compared to larger scale infrastructure projects, where revenue is exposed to market - or usage - risk\",\" Seth Tan, executive director of Infrastructure Asia, a facilitation office under the Singapore government, told OBG.By Oxford Business GroupMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Thanks to lower net imports of crude oil and higher net exports of natural gas, the gross U.S. energy exports hit a record-high in 2019, exceeding gross energy imports for the first time since 1952, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Monday.   Total gross energy exports from the United States hit an all-time high of 23.6 quadrillion British thermal units (quads) in 2019--a common unit of heat in which the EIA converts all different physical units of energy such as barrels and cubic feet.   While gross energy exports hit a record high, the U.S. energy imports fell to their lowest level in nearly 25 years - to 22.8 quads in 2019, the lowest since 1995. Over the past decade and a half, net U.S. energy imports have fallen from a peak of 30 quads in 2005, and they have been down every year since 2016, EIA's data shows. \"Last year's change in net energy trade in the United States--from 3.6 quads of net imports in 2018 to 0.8 quads of net exports in 2019--was the largest change in U.S. energy trade since 1980,\" according to the administration. Last year, the U.S. was still a net importer of crude oil, but net imports dropped by 31 percent in terms of energy content, according to EIA's estimates. Surging shale production and growing global demand for light low-sulfur oil helped U.S. crude exports to soar by 45 percent year on year in 2019, reaching an average of 2.98 million barrels per day (bpd), the EIA said last month. The United States exported crude oil to 44 different destinations last year, compared to 41 export destinations in 2018. Canada was the biggest buyer of American crude with a 15 percent share, closely followed by South Korea, with 14 percent of all U.S. crude exports. The United States was a net exporter of crude oil and petroleum products in February, with the four-week average net imports at a negative 907,000 bpd in the last week of February, the lowest 'imports' level in EIA data dating back to 1973. Despite the 'net petroleum exporter' status, the U.S. continues to be a net importer of crude oil--it continues to import more volumes of crude oil than it exports.

        "content": "Lukoil, the second-largest oil producer in Russia, plans to slash its crude oil production by 18 percent, or by 290,000 bpd, as part of the new OPEC+ production cut deal, president and chief executive Vagit Alekperov told Russia's news agency Interfax on Monday.Lukoil plans to reduce its oil production by 18 percent, or by more than 40,000 tons per day - which is equal to more than 290,000 barrels per day - Alekperov told Interfax, adding that Lukoil and all other oil firms in Russia would fulfill the quotas as per Russia's energy ministry orders.Lukoil expects oil prices to rise to $30 a barrel after the new agreement takes force in May, according to Lukoil.Early on Monday, Brent Crude was trading at around $27 barrel, while the U.S. benchmark price WTI Crude was tumbling by nearly 30 percent at $13 a barrel, due to Tuesday's expiry of the prompt-month May contract and the shrinking storage amid unprecedented demand loss in the U.S.According to Interfax, Russia's share of the OPEC+ cuts would be 1.8 million bpd in May and June compared to April.On the face of it, Russia agreed to much deeper cuts in the new deal than those it rejected in early March when Russia's refusal to back a collective 1.5 million bpd OPEC+ cut led to the one-month spat and the oil price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia. In reality, cheating with quotas has been an art in Russia since the start of the OPEC+ alliance more than three years ago.  In the new deal, which lacks clear mechanisms for compliance observance, Russia's target for oil production is 8.5 million bpd in May and June, Vitaly Yermakov, and James Henderson of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies wrote in a paper last week. However, it's not clear if condensate is included, which changes Russia's overall cut. Including condensate, Russia's share of the cuts should be 2.8 million bpd, without condensate, the cut would be around 2 million bpd, according to the authors.

That would be down from an average daily of 4.5 million bpd at the moment. The portion of the total that would fall to Kurdistan to cut was not specified.Two weeks ago, OPEC+ agreed to remove 9.7 million bpd of oil from the market, with the cuts beginning next month and remaining in effect until the end of June, after which the group will start to ramp up production gradually.From 9.7 million bpd in May to June, the cuts will decline to 7.7 million bpd for the period July to December 2020, and then further to 5.8 million bpd until the end of April 2022.So far, the decision has not had a positive effect on oil prices, even with the added weight of cuts from other oil producers outside the expanded block. On the contrary, Brent has fallen to about $27 a barrel, and West Texas Intermediate was trading below $12 a barrel at the time of writing.Last week, the energy ministers of Russia and Saudi Arabia said they were considering deepening the cuts further without providing any specific figures.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.com More Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

To help contain the disease, the country's petroleum industry watchdog ordered offshore field operators to reduce their workforce on platforms and extend their rotations to 28 days from 14 days.Meanwhile, as it also battles the effects of the supply-demand imbalance, Nigeria has slashed its oil prices by as much as $3 per barrel to attract more buyers. Even so, it may fail to do so as supply continues to far outweigh the demand for crude.The demand destruction and the low oil prices will hit many African oil producers, with Nigeria leading the pack with estimated revenue losses of $15.4 billion at $30 oil this year, estimates from the Atlantic Council's Africa Center showed last week.  The coronavirus is also taking its toll, and things could get worse before they get better, at least according to the World Health Organization. The WHO warned last week that Africa could become the next epicenter of the disease, after Europe and North America.The number of known cases in Africa had risen by 51 percent over the week to Friday, April 18, the WHO's director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreysus said, while the number of reported deaths increased by 60 percent over that same period.

For the first time ever, Chinese refinery throughput has surpassed refinery crude processing in the United States as China emerges from the lockdown. At the same time, U.S. fuel demand continues to plummet amid lockdowns in many states.According to the chart below by OilX, Chinese refiners are cranking up runs as the country emerges from the two-month-long lockdown. In contrast, refinery runs at U.S. refineries are plummeting, to the point that China is currently processing more crude oil at its refineries than the world's top oil consumer, the United States.Source: OilXChina's independent refiners, commonly known as teapots, began to restore some curtailed production in March, taking advantage of the cheap oil amid the oil price war as the country started to lift lockdowns and ease travel restriction measures gradually.At the same time, U.S. refineries are lowering utilization rates as demand for gasoline is at its lowest in decades while people work from home and practice social distancing.In the week to April 10, refineries in the U.S. processed an average of 12.7 million bpd of crude. This compares with 13.6 million bpd a week earlier and 14.9 million bpd three weeks ago, the EIA said in its weekly inventory report last week, which showed a record crude oil inventory build of 19.2 million barrels.\"We are seeing fast and furious gasoline demand destruction. The latest data reveals demand levels not seen since spring of 1968,\" AAA spokesperson Jeanette Casselano said at the beginning of last week.On Monday, AAA said that refinery rates dipped to 69 percent, a level not reported by the EIA in more than a decade.\"Despite lower run rates amid low demand, gasoline stocks increased.

        "content": "As the oil price crash squeezes oil companies across the globe, Mexico's Hacienda Hedge is set to deliver $6.2 billion to the Latin American country, Mexico's President Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Wednesday in Mexico City, according to Bloomberg.Mexico has been insulated from this week's extremely volatile oil prices, in that the hedge allows Mexico to sell its oil at a price that was determined earlier--prior to the price crash. In this case, Obrador said today, Mexico hedged at $49 per barrel. The current Mexican basket price is hovering a bit above $7 per barrel--a fine save for Mexico.Mexico employs the hedge to some extent every year, although some years it benefits more than others.This year the benefits of the hedge will be invaluable to Mexico's oil industry, which otherwise would have had a rough go of things at $7 per barrel for its oil exports.Of course, the hedge costs Mexico upfront--it has typically paid about $1 billion per year for the hedge ($1.23 billion in 2018), for the privilege of locking in a fixed price negotiated with banks and major traders. If market oil prices rise above that negotiated price, Mexico is able to sell its oil for those higher market prices. If oil prices fall, however, Mexico can sell its oil at the negotiated rate.This year, it turned out to be well worth its $1 billion spent.While it is unclear exactly how many barrels Mexico hedged at that $49 price, it typically hedges hundreds of millions of barrels.It is not known which banks are at the wrong end of this hedge but Citi, JPMorgan, and Goldman Sachs have been parties to the hedge before, and Shell and BP have also gotten into the action before. Whichever banks bet against the Hacienda hedge for 2020 will likely see a sharp hit to their bottom line, dwarfing the proceeds they took in during negotiations.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

The lockdown has since been extended to May 3.  Due to the lockdown and to India's struggles to contain the spread of the coronavirus, fuel demand in the world's third-largest oil importer is plummeting, so refineries are cutting run rates and struggling to store crude and refined products in dwindling available storage capacity.\"Some Indian refiners have cancelled their shipments for April and May,\" a source with a Mideast oil producer told Reuters, confirming the crash in India's oil demand. \"They will take these cargoes in the later part of the year to meet their annual commitment,\" the source told Reuters.Earlier this month, Indian Oil Corp (IOC), the country's biggest refiner and fuel retailer, was said to have declared a force majeure on oil imports from some of its top oil suppliers, including Saudi Arabia.With demand collapsing, India's oil refiners have already filled 95 percent of their combined storage capacity for fuel of 85 million barrels, officials at three state oil refiners told Bloomberg on Wednesday. Even the tanks at the 66,000 fuel stations in India are full, as more than a billion people are under lockdown and not driving.In the first two weeks of April, India's consumption of gasoline and diesel--more than half of the country's oil demand--crashed by over 60 percent, according to Bloomberg estimates.

This may not be as big pf a problem as it would have been at another time since the slump in demand for oil must have affected demand for tankers equally adversely--meaning there is free tanker capacity to use for storage.Demand for tankers to store oil has intensified significantly, the Wall Street Journal reported this week.\"We've reached a point where there must be some kind of halt in production to suck up the glut,\" the daily quoted a tanker broker as saying. \"It's the first time ever that we get more calls to book ships to store oil than to move it.\"According to data reviewed by the WSJ, some 100 of the 815 VLCCs available globally were booked during the 12 days to April 21, with average daily freight rates at $150,000. That's compared with $10,000 a year earlier, according to shipper Frontline.Meanwhile, storage space in the United States is getting closer to running out. \"At the current rate of increase, storage in the U.S. would fill in 7 to 8 weeks,\" a Mizuho analyst warned this week, while another expert warned of bankruptcies.\"The math is pretty simple. Current oil production is about 90 million barrels per day, but demand is only 75 million barrels per day.\" Gregory Leo, CIO of IDB Bank, told MarketWatch. \"While futures contracts expiring later this year are still trading as high as $30, if this supply/demand imbalance is not corrected their fate will be the same.

        "content": "The current situation in the oil market with prices plummeting is tough, but the market shouldn't be judged by a one-day or even a week-long slump, Vladimir Putin's Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday, calling for patience and an assessment of the market when the new OPEC+ agreement takes effect on May 1.\"We need to wait. The dynamics of global oil prices is really negative, the current situation is not easy, but one should assess it as a whole not by one day and not even by one week, but in a longer perspective. Therefore, now we just have to wait,\" Peskov told reporters in Moscow, as carried by Russian news agency TASS. Peskov was answering a question about whether Russia would consider taking additional measures in light of the relentless drop in oil prices, with US benchmark oil prices slumping 300% to a negative -$37 a barrel on Monday.Russia and its now friends-again OPEC agreed earlier this month to take 9.7 million bpd off the oil market in May and June in an attempt to stop the freefall in prices slammed by the massive demand loss in the pandemic.Analysts and the market, however, do not believe the OPEC+ cuts will be enough to prevent global storage overflowing by end-May at the latest, considering that the current demand collapse is around 30 million bpd-- three times higher than the promised OPEC+ cuts.Premium: The Oil Sector That Will Suffer The MostEarly on Wednesday, prices continued to drop, with Brent Crude crashing to its lowest level this century--to the lowest price level since 1999, before clawing back most of the losses for the day.On Tuesday, Saudi Arabia hinted for a second time in two weeks that it was ready to take further measures with OPEC+ to restore oil market stability.Also on Tuesday, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said in a statement that the pressure on the highly volatile oil market would continue until the start of the OPEC+ cuts in May until production in the countries outside OPEC+ starts coming off the market and until countries begin easing lockdowns. Attributing Monday's plunge of the WTI Crude May contract to the expiring futures contract and lack of storage, Novak said there was no need to dramatize the situation. OPEC+ countries are following the market closely, and they have all the instruments to react, if necessary, Novak said.    By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

Mexico will try to reduce spending with additional austerity measures amid the coronavirus pandemic and the oil price collapse, but it will not dismiss government staff, Lopez Obrador said, as quoted by Reuters.Lopez Obrador's 'Mexico First' energy policy agenda turned the OPEC+ meeting earlier this month into a soap opera after Mexico, part of the non-OPEC producers in the OPEC+ group, disagreed with proposals that it should reduce its production by 400,000 bpd from its October 2018 baseline, offering only a 100,000-bpd cut.The fact that Mexico's oil hedge protects it from the oil price crash - which hurts other OPEC+ countries much more - was said to be one of the reasons why Mexico dug in its heels and refused to cut its production as much as its OPEC+ partners asked it to.Nevertheless, the looming global recession and the collapsing oil prices will hit Mexico's economy.As WTI Crude prices crashed by 300% to settle at -$37 a barrel on Monday, the export basket of Mexican oil also plunged into negative territory for the first time ever. According to the daily estimate of the Mexican crude export basket by state oil firm Pemex, the price was -$2.37 a barrel as of Monday, down from $14.35 per barrel on Friday.Moody's downgraded Pemex's ratings on Monday, with Nymia Almeida, Moody's Senior Vice President, saying:\"The actions took in consideration our expectations for an extended period of negative free cash flow and the need for external funding, despite the company's efforts to adjust costs and investments to low oil prices.\"Fitch Ratings, for its part, downgraded Pemex for a second time this month, with the latest action on Friday reflecting \"limited flexibility to navigate the downturn in the oil and gas industry given its elevated tax burden, high leverage, rising per-barrel lifting costs and high investment needs to maintain production and replenish reserves.\"By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

Specifically, the USO announced that it would reallocate as follows:Why is the USO doing this? To avoid a repeat of the May WTI implosion, and to prevent a crash on May 19 when the June WTI contract expires. Now that we have seen what happens on maturity day, when on Monday the maturity of the May contract sparked a liquidation wave as nobody wanted to take delivery, traders were preparing to frontrun the USO getting delivery next month by shorting the hell out of the June contract. And since, it is all so very circular, by removing selling pressure on the front contract, the USO may fight to live another day.That was not all, however, because separately the USO also announced it may \"also invest in other oil-related investments such as cash-settled options on Oil Futures Contracts, forward contracts for oil, cleared swap contracts and non-exchange traded OTC transactions that are based on the price of oil, other petroleum-based fuels, Oil Futures Contracts and indexes based on the foregoing\"Premium: Oil Storage Nears Its Limit\"USO intends to attempt to continue tracking USO's benchmark as closely as possible, however significant tracking deviations may occur above and beyond the differences described herein.\"It wasn't clear just what other oil-linked assets the USO may invest in, however by now it is clear that the best return it can hope for is to merely be long puts on the USO itself.In short - anything to if not avoid, then at least delay liquidation.And while we admire the USCF's efforts to keep the USO alive, what would be very bad is if all 3 or now 4 WTI futures in which it has positions, were to turn negative.

Big Oil has never seen a mandatory production cut in Azerbaijan.But these are unprecedented times, and we are seeing a lot of firsts, including this week the first time that WTI oil futures went deep into negative territory.The most recent production cuts that are set to go into effect on May 1 call for some significant cuts--and Azerbaijan can't cut enough without enlisting the help of BP and its partners in the project, which include Equinor, Chevron, and ExxonMobil, too. Azerbaijan's state-run oil company, SOCAR, is also a partner in the project.The project in question is the Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli (ACG) project, which is a $38 billion project that lies 120km off the coast of Azerbaijan. It is thought to hold 5.4 billion barrels of recoverable oil, and was put into production in 1997. It is the largest oilfield in the Azerbaijan part of the Caspian Basin, according to BP's website.In 2019, the block in question produced an average of 542,000 bpd, according to BP.Under the deal forged with OPEC+ to cut project, Azerbaijan is required to cut its total production by 164,000 bpd--about 75,000 to 80,000 of which would need to come from the ACG project.

OPEC and its non-OPEC partners led by Russia agreed earlier this month to reduce their combined oil production by 9.7 million bpd in May and June, in response to the crash in global oil demand in the pandemic. Analysts, however, think that those cuts would be 'too little too late' to support the market, considering that the current demand loss stands at around 30 million bpd--three times the cuts promised by OPEC.Kuwait is OPEC's fourth-largest producer behind Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and the United Arab Emirates (UEA), and it pumped 2.84 million bpd of oil in March, up by 170,000 bpd from February, according to OPEC's secondary sources in its latest Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR). Kuwait, like its allies in the Persian Gulf, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia, opened the taps in March after early in the month Russia refused to back a 1.5-million-bpd collective OPEC+ cut to address the lower demand.But after the OPEC+ group managed to hammer out a new deal earlier in April, Kuwait now says that it had started to reduce supply to the market, and called for \"maintaining spirit of team work to face forthcoming challenges emanating from the coronavirus impact on the global oil demand.\"While Kuwait signals reductions in supply ahead of schedule, Saudi Arabia declined to comment for Bloomberg if it would cut supply before May, while UAE energy officials were not immediately available for comments. Iraq, however, a regular cheater in OPEC+ agreements, is not planning on reducing production before the start of the new deal, Alaa Al-Yasiri, acting director general of the state-run Oil Marketing Co, told Bloomberg.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

INTL FCStone Financial Inc said in a memo to clients with accounts of less than US$5 million that they shouldn't make new trades in WTI Crude and Brent Crude futures contracts for June delivery.  \"The reason for taking this action is for the best interest of our customers during these very unprecedented market conditions,\" the memo seen by Bloomberg says.Earlier this week, the United States Oil Fund LP (NYSEARCA: USO) - an ETF for crude - said in an SEC filing on Tuesday it was suspending the ability of the USO Authorized Purchasers to purchase new creation baskets. USO, one of the most popular oil-tracking ETFs for retail investors, was one of the reasons for the historic decline in May WTI futures on Monday.

It cannot take the risk to have negative prices before the roll and be on the hook. This shock is real. Be very careful out there.

        "content": "Collapsing demand and brimming storage in the United States, Canada's almost exclusive oil outlet, have resulted in a very usual situation in the Canadian oil industry. Prices for delivery at Cushing, Oklahoma, are so low that Canada's producers don't have incentive anymore to send their oil south of the border.  According to estimates of NE2 Group, cited by Bloomberg, the price of Western Canadian Select for May delivery was US$0.50 higher than the WTI Crude for May delivery at Cushing on Tuesday, the day on which the WTI May contract expired, having plunged to as low as -US$37 a barrel on the previous day for a historic crash of more than 300 percent. While most of the losses in WTI on Monday were attributed to the nature of the paper futures market and traders rushed the exit to avoid owning physical barrels of oil for delivery in May, the crash was indicative of the shrinking storage capacity at Cushing.Storage in Canada is also an issue and has been such for several years as oil sands production rose while not a single new pipeline has managed to clear all the hurdles necessary to go into operation.The collapse in oil demand, especially in Canada's key oil market, the United States, now adds another layer of uncertainty for oil sands producers, on top of the fact that WTI Crude prices--which Western Canadian Select typically tracks--have plunged.Canadian producers have already started shutting down steam-driven oil sands production projects, Reuters reports, noting the move could have dire long-term consequences for the production facilities. Husky Energy cut its oil sands output by 15,000 bpd. Cenovus reduced its production by 45,000 bpd and said it could raise this further to 100,000 bpd, nothing a cut of this size wouldn't damage the bitumen reservoirs. ConocoPhillips last week said it would cut its oil sands output by as much as 100,000 bpd.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

The unique combination of excess supply and a 30 percent drop in demand weighs heavily on oil-dependent economies throughout the world, and even low-cost Saudi Arabia is not exempt. The oil market is indeed flooded. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week, citing Saudi oil officials, that at least one in every ten VLCCs, each capable of carrying 2 million barrels of oil, is used for floating storage with many holding Saudi crude. Some of that, the sources said, had yet to find buyers.Saudi Arabia is bracing for the inevitable blow. In March, the government asked state agencies to cut their budgets by at least 20 percent, Reuters reported, citing sources in the know who declined to be named. That was before OPEC+ agreed to implement cuts of 9.7 million bpd in hopes this would help prices. It didn't.Now, according to an analyst with an Egypt-based investment bank, the Saudi deficit could widen to 15 percent of GDP, Bloomberg notes.

        "title": "Decarbonizing U.S. Electricity For $25 A Year",
        "content": "In our fractious domestic politics, squabbles over infrastructure spending are as old the republic. But here we propose an infrastructure project of considerable scope that the country needs and which would not require governmental assistance. The US electricity industry (utilities and other providers), we calculate, will have to spend $7-8 trillion in order to modernize (the average plant is about 35 years old) and to eliminate its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.The sectors most likely to continue to decarbonize, moving away from extensive fossil fuel use, are electricity production and vehicular transportation and freight movement. In theory, electric vehicles could be powered by electricity produced from coal-fired power stations which are still relatively prevalent across much of the nation, although there is no rationale to do so since running vehicles on coal-fired electricity would not reduce GHG emissions - just transfer them from the tailpipe to the smokestack at the power plant. Coal-fired electricity, however, will not get that market. And coal's principal \"enemy\" in this struggle for market share is not environmentalism. It is natural gas which has become cheaper and cleaner to use as boiler fuel.In this struggle, coal has already lost for a simple economic reason. In a commodity business like electricity, price is the only thing that matters. Now natural gas fired power generation faces price competition from renewables, mostly wind, that produce electricity with zero fuel costs--the principal cost input for gas fired generation apart from capital. The only thing we can safely say here is that if present cost trends persist the penetration of renewables is likely to increase. And since the electricity fuel mix is something of a zero-sum game in a low growth environment ,that means that coal usage will trend to zero (as it did in the UK) and natural gas generators will have to struggle with ever cheapening renewables.But switching gears for a moment, the reason electricity production is singled out for regulation is one of policy practicality. If mitigating pollution is the goal, it is easier for the government to regulate a few thousand large power plants than a few hundred million motor vehicles. And in doing so we could reduce the nation's output of greenhouse gases by about 25 percent.And this brings us to our favorite part of the discussion, namely, what will all this cost and how do we propose to pay for it? Up front electric utility industry capital spending would more than double - to $350-400 billion per year if this clean energy transition occurs over a period of 20 years. Current annual industry capital spending is about $150 billion per year.Related: Oil Prices Hit $1 Following A 90% CrashBut there are two components to this forward-looking capital expenditure plan. First, much of our present electricity infrastructure is simply aging out and must be replaced, and the cost of a new utility plant far exceeds the cost of the original. Therefore, about two-thirds of the large so-called \"green\" capital replacement program would be devoted simply to modernizing aging assets in all aspects of the present power business - generation, transmission, and distribution. The bottom line? U.S. electricity industry capital spending will increase (assuming we wish to maintain present levels of service) even without a strong environmental push towards decarbonization.If U.S. utilities committed to a refurbishment and decarbonization program this would elevate their prospective annual capital expenditures by at least $200 billion. This would significantly boost the U.S.'s non-financial corporate capital spending which totaled $2 trillion last year. This number for obvious pandemic related reasons is headed lower this year. And unlike the plethora of recently announced federal economic stimulus programs, this level of electricity capital expenditures once committed to would not evaporate once the present emergency recedes or political interest fades.The next question is \"Who would pay for this effort?\" In the U.S. electricity business as presently structured, the answer is the customer. Costs of a new plant (like a thirty-year home mortgage) are spread out over the often very long lives of equipment. We calculate that in real terms the average electric bill would increase roughly 2 percent per year simply to modernize our present electricity industry and 4 percent annually to modernize and fully decarbonize.These rough \"ballpark\" estimates may, in fact, overstate the total cost of decarbonization. Green power projects tend to be smaller than conventional baseload generation. And given present economics, smaller facilities tend to experience far fewer cost overruns than big, old-style power plants. This, in turn, lowers their investment risk and ultimately lowers their cost of capital as well.Technological improvements have been coming in faster for renewables than for conventional facilities, too. In addition, a growing body of investors are seeking to fund specifically green projects and that demand also reduces industry capital costs. Furthermore, there is some indication that if the industry adopted a \"half a loaf\" strategy with respect to the elimination of greenhouse gas emissions, keeping a residuum of fossil-fired plants online to ensure reliability, it could further minimize planned cost increases.Let's stick to the 2 percent annual electricity price increase attributable to decarbonization for the sake of conservatism. This would cause average household electric bills in the U.S. to rise by about $25 per year. But here is the really startling statistic. As vital as electricity is to residential and industrial users alike, the revenues from this key industry equates to only 2 percent of U.S. gross domestic product. Stated differently, the typical residential electric bill totals only 2 percent of household income. If our estimates are even remotely accurate then paying for a clean, modern electricity system would barely impact most household budgets.But the present Republican administration in Washington takes a rather lax view on pollution and potential polluters in general. What would encourage U.S. electricity producers, many of whom at least until recently were ardent climate change deniers to begin with, to move forward on a capital program of this size? A carbon tax? Sure, but not with the present leadership in Washington.The states, however, under our bifurcated regulatory regime (states and the Feds both have authority) do have the power to influence both the price and the means of producing electricity. Long term capital plans, as well as authorized returns on shareholder equity, must be approved by state public utility commissions. Many have set renewable energy standards to encourage action, but these tend to remove carbon at a high cost.Related: Saudi Supertankers Stranded As Oil Price War BackfiresBut the state regulatory apparatus already exists to hasten this process and even make it more efficient. States can, for instance, offer accelerated asset retirements to encourage more rapid closure of existing fossil-fired power generating plants or grant companies a higher return on equity for those who produce or distribute low carbon electricity.In our present age of minimal interest rates, even a small incremental boost leads to a big uptick in profits. A 1 percent bonus on sales of low carbon electricity, for instance, would raise pretax net income by a full 10 percent if fully implemented - a number that would undoubtedly enhance utility industry enthusiasm for decarbonization.An accelerated capital investment program along the line suggested here would transform U.S. electric utility companies (and other electricity producers and suppliers) into the growth stocks they were in the 1950s and 1960s. In those halcyon days of yesteryear, the U.S.'s electric utilities offered investors both growth and income. Hard as it may be to believe there were electric companies included in the \"Nifty Fifty\", an ancient precursor of today's FANGs. Back then, the industry spent lavishly both to modernize and meet accelerating post-war demand - all while increasing margins due to increasing economies of scale.There is an ongoing need in the investment community for companies that offer the unusual combination of growth and income. But apart from the needs of Wall Street, a capital program along the lines contemplated here should easily attract capital for this capital replacement/decarbonization spending marathon as well as boost the economy with years of steady investment. Collaterally this would stimulate demand for new technologies and workers locally to construct new plants. This would also reduce the nation's greenhouse gas emissions by one fifth, directly, and enable electric vehicle users to run on green electricity, thereby reducing emissions perhaps by another fifth. Finally, this would modernize an aging electricity grid to meet the challenges of an energy-hungry digital economy in an increasingly challenging operating environment.By the time our present pandemic related difficulties are over, the U.S. federal government alone will probably spend in excess of five or six trillion dollars supporting the economy.  For roughly the same amount, we could rebuild the entire electricity infrastructure cleanly and with a price tag that most Americans would barely notice. And for the most part, it's \"shovel ready.\"By Leonard S. Hyman and William I. TillesMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

Under the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, it is illegal to profit on the markets from leaked government information.  The CFTC probe was opened before Monday's 300% price crash of the WTI Crude May futures contract, which slipped into negative territory for the first time ever, according to Bloomberg's sources. The regulator's investigation is focused on whether the traders involved had obtained non-public information about Russia's position during the one-month long oil price war with Saudi Arabia after the collapse of the previous OPEC+ deal in early March.Between early March and early April, Russia and Saudi Arabia were in an oil price war that further depressed oil prices already hit by the demand collapse in the pandemic, after Moscow refused to back a total 1.5 million bpd cut from OPEC+. A month later, the Saudis and the Russians, along with the other members of the OPEC+ group, agreed to remove 9.7 million bpd from the market in May and June to try to counter the growing glut.As per Bloomberg's sources, the individuals under investigation are not Russian government officials and do not have a prior history of trading futures. One of the sources, however, told Bloomberg that the entities that had placed the crude oil price wagers employ people with ties to the Kremlin.The UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has also opened an investigation into suspicious crude futures trades for the same reason--suspecting that non-public information about Russia's oil strategy and discussions with other oil-producing countries may have been leaked to traders who may have later used it to illegally bet on crude prices.\"We saw the reports and we don't know how credible they are,\" Dmitry Peskov, Vladimir Putin's press secretary, said on Thursday, as quoted by Reuters.

The U.S. became the seventh biggest oil supplier to India in the year through March 2020, climbing up from the 9th place in the top suppliers' list in 2018/2019, according to the data compiled by Reuters.  India had already boosted its imports of U.S. crude oil after the United States ended the waivers for Iranian oil customers when it stepped up the sanctions pressure on Iran's regime last year.Most recently, in India's nationwide lockdown to contain the pandemic, demand for oil in the country has plunged while storage capacity fills up. Due to plummeting fuel demand and overflowing storage capacity, at least three oil refiners in India have asked for lower crude oil imports for May from the Middle East, including from the world's top exporter, Saudi Arabia, officials at the refiners told Reuters on Wednesday.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "The federal government will keep royalty rates for offshore oil production despite a push from the industry to lower the payments burden amid the covid-19 crisis, a Louisiana senator told Reuters.\"These are the cards that we're dealt,\" Republican Senator Bill Cassidy said. \"The Secretary of Interior does not feel like he has the ability to go beyond normal process.\"Earlier this month, reports emerged that one oil company active in offshore oil production had approached the Department of the Interior with a request for lower royalty rates in response to the low oil price environment.The report follows a call from legislators from the Gulf Coast states on the Department of the Interior to reduce the royalty rates offshore oil companies have to pay to the government amid the crisis.\"Such an action in the short term will help mitigate a price war that is sinking prices and decreasing production,\" the legislators said in a letter to Interior Secretary David Bernhardt.The offshore royalty rate for water depths of less than 200 meters stands at 12.5 percent, according to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. For all depths above 200 meters, the royalty rate is 18.75 percent. The BOEM reduced the shallow water rate in 2017 as part of the Trump administration's energy industry support agenda.Senator Cassidy was one of the authors of the letter to the DoI in early April. At the time, he expected that the government would provide the needed help. But the only remedy available to oil companies will be applying for relief under a Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement program that the industry has previously criticized as taking too much effort and time.Meanwhile, the industry across the country is shutting wells and laying off workers. As the New York Times' Clifford Krauss reported this week, refineries are idling, wells are shutting in, and drillers are being let go with early termination fees.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Continental Resources has stopped drilling operations and shut in most of its wells in North Dakota, Reuters reports, citing sources familiar with the situation, who also added that the company had notified some of its clients that it would suspend deliveries.Earlier this month, official data from North Dakota showed that oil producers had idled as much as 25 percent of wells in the state, cutting production by 260,000 bpd. This is a large portion of the state's total oil output, which averaged some 1.45 million bpd in February, according to data from the state's Department of Mineral Resources. Since then, North Dakota has shed as much as 40 percent of drilling rigs.In mid-April, State Mineral Resources Director Lynn Helms said that some oil producers were considering building storage facilities near the wells to stock up on the crude they have already pumped to sell it later when prices improve.Continental, according to Reuters, had cut its production by close to a third even before oil prices swung below zero on Monday. It also suspended dividend payments. The company's chief executive, Harold Hamm, is a proponent of heavy government intervention in the industry to control production, including asking Texas regulators to institute a 25-percent mandatory production cut.The Texas Railroad Commission has been discussing mandatory cuts, but in the latest update, reported by the Houston Chronicle, the three commissioners delayed their vote on the topic until next month.Continental has found itself in a more vulnerable position than fellow shale producers who hedged their 2020 production at prices now much higher than the current level of U.S. benchmarks. Unlike them, Continental bet on continued price improvement and did not hedge. Instead, Bakken crude traded at about $3 per barrel this week--much lower than even battered WTI, which recovered some of its massive losses to trade at $16-17 a barrel since the Monday crash.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Mexico's state-held oil firm Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) said on Sunday that it had started to reduce the number of oil workers at its offshore oil platforms to reduce the risk of coronavirus spreading.As many as 259 rig workers returned from Gulf of Mexico platforms to the shore on Sunday, none of whom was found to be suspicious of COVID-19 infection, and all workers were sent home, Pemex said in a statement. With this, the company is cutting personnel on platforms by 50 percent to reduce the risk of infections and implement distancing measures.\"Indispensable staff will remain on board to keep up production,\" a source at Pemex told Reuters, noting that the \"It's a situation similar to when a hurricane comes.\"So far, Pemex has registered 248 cases of coronavirus, including 28 deaths. Among the dead, five people were currently working for Pemex, 14 people were retired Pemex workers, and eight were family members, the company said in its statement on Sunday.The reduced number of employees at Pemex's offshore platforms will likely lead to reduced oil production, Reuters' source said.The coronavirus pandemic and the oil price crash came at a time in which Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador was pinning his hopes on Pemex to turn around the country's oil production which has been on a downward trend over the past decade.The oil price meltdown will affect Mexico's economy and is bound to deepen the global economic crisis, Lopez Obrador said last week, a week after he clinched what he touted as a significant victory in Mexico's foreign policy, refusing to agree to the cuts that OPEC+ had carved out for his country. The fact that Mexico's oil hedge protects it from the oil price crash - which hurts other OPEC+ countries much more - was said to be one of the reasons why Mexico dug in its heels and refused to cut its production as much as its OPEC+ partners asked it to.Nevertheless, the looming global recession and collapsing oil prices will hit Mexico's economy and oil production.

        "title": "Oil Majors May Be Forced To Cut Crude Output In Nigeria",
        "content": "Africa's largest oil producer, OPEC member Nigeria, has yet to figure out how and from where to cut production as part of the OPEC+ deal, and this has led to a delay in the May and June crude oil export plans of Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), trading sources told Reuters on Monday. The new OPEC+ production cut deal to remove a total of 9.7 million bpd from the market in May and June enters into force on May 1.  Nigeria will be producing 1.412 million bpd in May-June 2020, 1.495 million bpd in July-December 2020, and 1.579 million bpd between January 2021 and April 2022, as part of the OPEC+ agreement, Nigeria's Ministry of Petroleum Resources said in a statement after OPEC+ sealed the deal on April 12.   This is in addition to condensate production of 360,000 bpd to 460,000 bpd from which Nigeria is exempt from the cuts, the ministry noted. According to OPEC's secondary sources in its official production figures for March 2020, Nigeria pumped 1.853 million bpd of crude oil in March, up by 65,000 bpd compared to February. Since NNPC operates many of the oilfields in Nigeria in joint ventures with international oil majors, including Exxon, Chevron, Shell, and Eni, the Nigerian state oil firm is still negotiating the cuts with oil majors. This is the reason why the crude oil loading program for June and the official selling prices (OSPs) for May have been delayed, a trading source told Reuters.According to other trading sources who spoke to Reuters, Nigeria's flagship Bonny Light crude grade has been recently offered at a discount of $5 a barrel to dated Brent, while it would have fetched a premium of $3 a barrel over Brent if market conditions were normal.There are April and May cargoes of Nigerian oil that have not been sold yet, other sources say--a sign that demand is so depressed that no one wants even oil at $15 a barrel or less. In these circumstances, Nigeria has no other choice but to cut its production. \"We have to cut down, whether with or without OPEC output cut deal. We have to reduce our oil production level because we do not have where to take the oil to, till the situation improves. The impact of the crisis is global and not on Nigeria alone,\" Mele Kyari, Group Managing Director at NNPC, told Nigeria's Premium Times last week.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Halliburton will suspend most of its operations in Venezuela, the company said, after Washington tightened the noose around Caracas by banning U.S. oil companies operating in the country from drilling for oil, transporting it, or providing any equipment for use in Venezuela.In an SEC filing, Halliburton said the Office of Foreign Assets Control prohibited it from doing most of what it does in Venezuela, including \"the drilling, lifting, or processing of, purchase or sale of, or transport or shipping of any Venezuelan-origin petroleum or petroleum products; and (b) the design, construction, installation, repair, or improvement of any wells or other facilities or infrastructure in Venezuela or the purchasing or provision of any goods or services, except as required for safety.\"The only operations that Halliburton was allowed under the new tighter rules set by Washington have to do with safety and the preservation of its Venezuelan assets. If it does pull out of the country, Venezuela will likely expropriate Halliburton's assets since it will not be able to remove them.In its suspension of activity in Venezuela, Halliburton follows Chevron, which said last week it had been ordered by the federal government to wind down its Venezuelan operations by the end of the year.According to the company's website, it has participation in five onshore and offshore oil projects in Venezuela through four joint ventures with PDVSA. Last year, Chevron's share of production from these ventures was 34,000 bpd.Until recently, Chevron was reluctant to pull out of Venezuela, where it has invested some $2.6 billion over the hundred years of its presence in the country. The company argued that if U.S. companies leave, they will leave an opening for Chinese and Russian players, reducing U.S. influence in Venezuela. Now, however, with prices crashing and the outlook bleak, a pullout might begin to make more sense for Chevron.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads from Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Diamond Offshore Drilling has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, becoming the second major victim of the oil market crash so far, after Whiting Petroleum filed earlier this month.With a debt pile of $2.6 billion, according to the Financial Times, Diamond Drilling said the move was motivated by the unprecedented oil price crash, saying in its filing that conditions in the oil industry had \"worsened precipitously in recent months.\"According to Bloomberg, at least seven oil companies in North America have gone under since the start of the year, all before WTI and other benchmarks turned negative for a day last week. This has motivated creditors to pout their demands for repayment from troubled oil players on hold to avoid ending up with assets worth pretty much nothing amid the oil demand devastation that the coronavirus pandemic wreaked on the world.Diamond Drilling said it had tried borrowing more to stave off disaster as well as taking other steps to avoid bankruptcy but had failed. Bloomberg notes that Diamond Drilling is at a disadvantage to other drillers because it focuses on offshore drilling. Offshore drilling is a lot more expensive than onshore drilling, making the pain a lot deeper for companies focused on the former.More bankruptcies are on the way, according to forecasters. Earlier this month, Rystad Energy warned that as many as 533 U.S. oil companies go bankrupt if oil stays at around $20 a barrel.\"$30 is already quite bad, but once you get to $20 or even $10, it's a complete nightmare,\" said Rystad's head of shale research, Artem Abramov. He added, \"At $10, almost every US E&P company that has debt will have to file Chapter 11 or consider strategic opportunities.\"The Motley Fool surveyed energy experts about which companies are the most likely to be next to file for bankruptcy, and Diamond Drilling was among them when the findings were published last Friday.

        "content": "Pipeline giant Energy Transfer will be asking the Texas Railroad Commission to allow it to idle two pipelines in Texas and turn them into storage for around 2 million barrels of oil, the company told Argus Media this week.U.S. oil producers are struggling amid collapsing demand and oil prices while inventories across America are growing. Producers in Texas struggle to place their barrels with the U.S. Gulf Coast refineries, which are cutting crude processing rates in response to plunging fuel demand. The massive oil demand drop in the U.S. and overseas due to lockdowns in the COVID-19 pandemic has had U.S. oil producers scrambling to find storage for their produced barrels when no one wants more oil right now. Earlier this month, Enterprise Products Partners applied to open the northbound capacity of its Seaway pipeline, offering U.S. oil producers struggling to place their oil near the Gulf Coast to ship their barrels to the primary storage hub at Cushing, Oklahoma.   \"Given the current turmoil in the crude oil market, including impacts on both refinery and export demand, there is strong market interest to access the Cushing storage market,\" the pipeline operator said in a filing with the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), as carried by Reuters.  But many analysts think that available storage in Cushing will fill up by the middle of May, or the end of May, at the latest, if demand doesn't materially pick up by then. This is an unlikely scenario, considering the lockdowns and work from home policies in many states.If Energy Transfer's plan to idle two Texas pipelines for storage is approved, \"After that it will be a matter of adding pumps to the lines, which we can easily achieve,\" Energy Transfer told Argus this week.\"We estimate we can be ready by mid-May,\" a spokeswoman for the company told Bloomberg in an email.

The law firm of Klayman & Toskes believes that investments in the energy sector, including the Alerian MLP Index (INDEXCME: AMZ) \"may have been marketed and sold to customers who were risk averse, such as retirees or other conservative investors, that were seeking income and capital preservation and were not explained the potential risks.\"The Alerian MLP Index, the leading gauge of energy infrastructure Master Limited Partnerships, fell from $220 in January, to just $70.85 in mid-March. \"Investors may seek damages for violations of sales practice rules and regulations in FINRA Arbitration if they were recommended investments in several major U.S. oil and gas sector firms, including Exxon, Chevron, Phillips 66, ConocoPhillips, EOG Resources, Kinder Morgan, Schlumberger, Valero Energy Corp, Marathon Petroleum Corp, Enterprise Products Partners, Tallgrass Energy, and Energy Transfer, among others,\" the law firm said.The bulk of the market carnage came on Monday, when WTI Crude futures collapsed into negative territory, resulting in a lot of losses for individual investors.Pierre Andurand, for example, warned traders on Tuesday of massive losses in ETFs.\"This shock is real.

The company will be distributing the initial production of 160,000 gallons of medical grade sanitizer - enough to fill nearly 5 million 4-ounce bottles - to medical providers and first responders.   Exxon has boosted its monthly production of the key ingredient in sanitizer- isopropyl alcohol--by around 3,000 tons at its chemical manufacturing facility in Baton Rouge. To produce, package and distribute hand sanitizer, the company has bought additional ingredients and modified equipment in Baton Rouge and at a lubricants plant in nearby Port Allen, Louisiana.Earlier this month, Exxon said that it had boosted production of critical raw materials for masks, gowns, and hand sanitizer used by medical professionals and first responders.While it increases production of sanitizer, Exxon is axing capital expenditure for this year by $10 billion in response to the oil demand and oil price collapse. The most significant reductions will take place in the Permian Basin. Exxon's capital investments for 2020 are now expected to be 30 percent lower, at around $23 billion, down from the previously announced capex of some $33 billion.As the world now needs more sanitizer than oil, international oil majors are taking part in the fight against the pandemic with donations and with increased production of chemical substances and raw materials for critical components of personal protective equipment (PPE).

These would be the largest cuts that Russia will ever attempt to make as part of the OPEC+ group. In the previous deals, Russia hasn't fully complied with its quotas, attributing non-compliance to weather, complex geology, or the fact that condensate was considered (until December) as part of its oil production.While Russia is likely to struggle to hit that reduction target, the slashed exports from the European seaports suggest that Moscow will be limiting the oil supply to international markets at a time when global inventories of crude and gasoline threaten to overflow amid the massive demand collapse in the pandemic.Exports of Russia's key export blend Urals are expected to slump to the lowest level since at least the early 2000s, according to data from Refinitiv Eikon, cited by Reuters.Production of crude oil and condensate in Russia has been unchanged so far in April compared to March. According to data from the Russian energy ministry, seen by Bloomberg, Russia's crude and condensate production averaged 11.289 million bpd between April 1 and 23--a week before Russia is set to reduce its production under the new agreement.

They were, however, unable to do so. According to a former employee with Pemex's trading arm, PMI, 60 tankers are waiting off the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of Mexico, each carrying an average of 300,000 barrels of gasoline, for a total of 18 million barrels.Demand for fuel in Mexico, however, has slumped. As a result, Pemex has opted for a force majeure declaration to avoid having to pay penalties linked to other alternatives such as suspending supply contracts or spot market purchases, the Reuters source said.What makes the situation complicated for PMI is the fact that since last year, the company has been buying more fuel under long-term contracts rather than on the spot market, which makes it liable for more contract suspension penalties.Bloomberg reports fuel purchases at gas stations has fallen by 50 percent amid the national lockdown that President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador ordered. The idling of those 60 tankers was one part of the fallout of this order on the oil industry. Because of the idling, PMI has been paying the abovementioned penalties for more than a week now. The daily average of these penalties--called demurrage fees--comes in at $1.5 million, or about $25,000 per tanker, Bloomberg notes.The problem is not confined to the Mexican side; the fuel that U.S. refiners sell to Mexico is a special blend as per the buyer's requirements.

Within several weeks, the sources told Reuters, all drilling will cease.The news was only to be expected after Continental--the largest oil producer in North Dakota--started shrinking production. With prices close to historic lows, it was only a matter of time before well shut-ins and frac holidays began.North Dakota's oil production has fallen by about 300,000 bpd so far, and counting. Earlier in April, official data from the state's administration showed a quarter of all oil wells had been shut in, cutting production by some 260,000 bpd. That was before the Continental news came out. Oasis is a much smaller producer. At the end of 2019, its daily average stood at 87,400 bpd of oil equivalent. In its latest financial report, the company calculated its operating costs at $6.95 per barrel, which was substantially below its earlier guidance. In the current situation, however, it was not low enough.Oasis also has a substantial debt burden, at over $2.7 billion and Moody's has already warned that the company might run into debt refinancing problems because of the oil price context.\"While Oasis' cash flow deteriorates due to low commodity prices, the company will also face increasing debt refinancing risk,\" a Moody's analyst said in a note earlier in April. The agency's outlook on Oasis is negative, revised from stable.More production cuts may be on the way in the North Dakota portion of the Bakken: energy regulators from the state have scheduled a meeting for May 20 to discuss whether continuing to produce oil at current prices does not constitute a waste of resources.

        "content": "A small privately held oil and gas company from Tulsa, Oklahoma, is suing Continental Resources over a deal from which Continental withdrew after oil prices plunged in early March, Reuters reported on Tuesday, citing a lawsuit filed with the Tulsa County District Court.According to the plaintiffs, Casillas Petroleum, Continental Resources backed out of a deal to buy oil and gas properties from Casillas. According to the lawsuit filed on April 15, the two companies struck the agreement on March 6. They expected the deal to be closed some three weeks later.March 6, however, was the day on which the OPEC+ deal collapsed. Oil prices went into a tailspin after Saudi Arabia promised to flood the market with oil, which it did for most of March and April, before promising to curtail supply as part of the new OPEC+ agreement to prevent further price slides.It was Continental Resources' founder Harold Hamm who said in early March that the Saudi move to flood the global market with crude oil was illegal. According to the lawsuit filed by Casillas Petroleum, Continental first proposed a delay in the closing date of the deal. It then terminated the agreement on March 24. In the lawsuit, the smaller firm is asking the court to order Continental to complete the acquisition and pay attorneys' fees and other costs to Casillas. The price crash of the past month and a half has upended deals for several major companies, including from BP, which changed some of the terms of a $5.6 billion sale of its Alaskan business, which analysts think may see the supermajor receive lower cash component for the deal this year.  Continental Resources, for its part, is said to have stopped drilling operations and shut in most of its wells in North Dakota in light of the dire market conditions in the U.S. shale patch. Earlier this month, Continental said it plans to cut its April and May production by around 30 percent. It also suspended its quarterly dividend until further notice as part of its \"proactive strategy to manage cash flow in a challenging commodity price environment.\" By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "The American Petroleum Institute (API) estimated on Tuesday another large crude oil inventory build of 9.978 million barrels for the week ending April 24 as the demand destruction continues and storage space nears its upper limits.Today's inventory build was expected to be slightly larger, at 10.619 million barrels.In the previous week, the API estimated a large build in crude oil inventories of 13.226 million barrels, while the EIA's estimates were for a build of 15 million barrels for that week.Oil prices were mixed on Tuesday afternoon prior to the API's data release, With WTI trading slightly down and Brent slightly up.At 4:03 pm EDT on Tuesday the WTI benchmark was trading down on the day by $0.08 (-0.63%) at $12.70--down roughly $0.40 per barrel week over week. The price of a Brent barrel was trading up on Tuesday, by $0.57 (+2.85%), at $20.56--up roughly $0.70 week on week.The API reported a draw of 1.108 million barrels of gasoline for week ending April 24, after last week's 3.435-million-barrel build. This week's build compares to analyst expectations for a 2.527-million-barrel build for the week.Distillate inventories were up by 5.462 million barrels for the week, compared to last week's 7.639-barrel build, while Cushing inventories saw a gain of 2.486 million barrels.US crude oil production as estimated by the Energy Information Administration showed that production for the week ending April 17 fell to 12.2 million bpd--down 100,000 bpd for the week, and down 900,000 from its high.At 4:37 pm EDT, WTI was trading at $12.67 while Brent was trading at $20.65.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "The Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo, which includes Fort McMurray - the hub of Alberta's oil sands business - has issued a mandatory evacuation order for all of downtown Fort McMurray after a river flooded the area.There hasn't been any flooding to sites of oil companies with operations in the area, Karim Zariffa, executive director of the Oil Sands Community Alliance (OSCA), told Reuters.Some of the oil sands firms are helping to pump water out of flooded areas by sending emergency staff, Zariffa told Reuters.The ice on the Athabasca River broke on Sunday and resulted in major flooding, also prompting a secondary state of local emergency in the area, which is already under a state of emergency due to the coronavirus pandemic.Natural disasters in the Fort McMurray area are nothing new. Back in 2016, major wildfires forced oil sands companies in the area to evacuate thousands of oil workers and shut down operations.This year's wildfire season has yet to come, but Fort McMurray is already grappling with efforts to contain the pandemic and with the new disaster--the flooding.As if natural disasters weren't enough, Fort McMurray -and Alberta's oil industry - are struggling with the oil market disaster these days, after prices started plunging in early March following the (temporary) end of the OPEC+ deal and the massive oil demand loss in the pandemic.Canadian producers have already started shutting down steam-driven oil sands production projects, Reuters reports, noting the move could have dire long-term consequences for the production facilities. Husky Energy cut its oil sands output by 15,000 bpd. Cenovus reduced its production by 45,000 bpd and said it could raise this further to 100,000 bpd, nothing a cut of this size wouldn't damage the bitumen reservoirs. ConocoPhillips said it would cut its oil sands output by as much as 100,000 bpd.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "title": "Canada's Oil Firms Set To Curtail Output By At Least 1 Million Bpd",
        "content": "As Canadian oil firms prepare to start reporting what would surely be bleak Q1 earnings and short-term outlooks, analysts expect that the companies will announce curtailments in production to the tune of around 1 million bpd in the coming months given the demand loss and low oil prices.   \"It is hard for us to fathom how Western Canadian crude production can avoid a ~1 million+ bbl/d drop in output in the coming weeks,\" Michael Dunn, an analyst at Stifel FirstEnergy, said in a note, as carried by Bloomberg.Companies in Canada have already reacted to the oil price plunge, but analysts and investors will be looking for further clues in the earnings reports about how they plan to go through the second major oil crisis in just five years.Husky Energy has cut its budget and production, Cenovus Energy slashed its 2020 capital spending by around 32 percent, Suncor cut capital guidance, and so did Canadian Natural Resources. Athabasca Oil Corporation also cut its capex and proactively curtailed heavy oil production at Hangingstone. \"I expect to see cuts everywhere ... It's a survival game right now,\" Athabasca Oil's CEO Rob Broen told Calgary Herald columnist Chris Varcoe last month. \"Being price takers has made us uniquely vulnerable to dramatic shifts in the oil price and what we're seeing today will have immediate negative impacts on Canada's economy,\" Tim McMillan, President and CEO at the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP), said in early March when international oil prices crashed 25 percent.  According to Rystad Energy estimates, \"Canadian curtailments are already in full swing, and the building storage crisis will continue to test operations as we approach May when global storage is likely to reach full functional capacity. Unless more significant upstream volumes are cut globally, Canadian curtailments may ultimately exceed 1.3 million bpd in the second quarter,\" Rystad Energy's senior analyst Thomas Liles said earlier this week.

        "content": "U.S. oil companies have started sending oil to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, Bloomberg reports, citing a Department of Energy official. According to the official, since the start of April, some 1.1 million barrels of crude have been sent into the SPR after the federal government finalized negotiations with nine companies for leasing SPR space for them to store their crude in.The talks for the lease of 23 million barrels worth of space began earlier this month, amid fast-falling prices that tanked deep below zero on April 20. Since then, West Texas Intermediate has recovered above zero but has been unable to sustain a level of above $20 a barrel. After yesterday the United States Oil Fund said it would sell all its WTI futures contracts for June delivery within four days, WTI again slid lower, trading at $11.11 a barrel at the time of writing. Brent traded at $19.20 a barrel, down by close to 4 percent while WTI was down by almost 13 percent.It was a massive selloff to avoid physical delivery that brought about negative WTI prices this month. The selloff could repeat as storage space runs out, both onshore and offshore. Vessel demand data from Signal Group shows a marked increase in demand for Very Large Crude Carriers--the ones that can hold up to 2 million barrels of crude.But space is running out both in terms of tankers and in terms of tanks onshore. Besides, SPR, the central storage hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, is reportedly soon to reach its limit, according to a Reuters report. The report cited traders as saying despite official data putting the Cushing occupancy rate at 70 percent, the rest has already been booked by oil companies looking for storage space. The hub has a capacity for 76 million barrels. As of April 17, it held 53 million barrels.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Amid a worsening gasoline shortage and Chevron and Halliburton's imminent exit from Venezuela, the Nicolas Maduro government is looking to reverse the radical decline in its oil industry with two new appointments--one which involves putting a fugitive drug trafficker at the helm of its troubled oil industry.Tareck El Aissami, previously Minister of Industries and National Production--and a current member of America's 10 Most Wanted--will replace Manuel Quevedo as Oil Minister. The second appointment places the cousin of late president Hugo Chavez at the helm of state oil company PDVSA.El Aissami was recently added to the United States' list of 10 most wanted fugitives on charges of drug-trafficking after three years ago he was sanctioned for drug trafficking. He was later accused of violating the sanctions by receiving payments for facilitating the transportation of drugs, Reuters reports.Venezuela has been fighting hyperinflation and persistent basic goods shortages as well as inexorably declining oil production brought about by a combination of underinvestment, mismanagement, and U.S. sanctions. From more than 2 million bpd, its output has fallen to just 700,000 bpd.It may fall further now that the United States is pressuring Chevron and Halliburton into leaving the country. The U.S. Office of Foreign Asset Control tightened Venezuelan oil sanctions earlier this month that pretty much prohibit both U.S. companies from doing business in the country. Chevron's joint venture with PDVSA produces about 200,000 bpd of heavy crude.In February, Maduro declared an energy emergency that also aimed to overhaul the country's struggling oil industry. It seems it hasn't worked so far, with gasoline shortages worsening so much that the government began to shut down fuel stations across the country. Venezuela produces little gasoline because its refinery network is in the same state of disrepair as its oil industry as a whole. It also imports little after imports from the United States stopped. Venezuela was the one that suspended imports from the U.S. amid the escalating row between the two.Venezuelan oil, meanwhile, has fallen to below $10 per barrel. This is the lowest in more than twenty years.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

Stitt said.\"Over-production of oil continues to threaten the economy, posing many environmental threats to Oklahoma and other producing states with no demand and rapidly diminishing storage capacity,\" the Governor noted.  Oklahoma Corporation Commission, the oil regulator in the state, passed last week an emergency order allowing oil producers to keep their leases if they shut production due to the very low oil prices, collapsing demand, and storage shortage.Oil producers in Oklahoma and across the entire U.S. oil patch are curtailing production amid the glut and regional prices in the single digits because of lack of storage amid crashing demand.Continental Resources is said to have stopped drilling operations and shut in most of its wells in North Dakota, ConocoPhillips is curtailing some production in Canada and the U.S. until market conditions improve--and these are just a few examples of large companies responding to the gloomy market conditions.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "title": "Kazakhstan Negotiating 22% Oil Output Cut",
        "content": "Kazakhstan is in talks with the companies operating its two large oil projects to reduce total output by 22 percent in compliance with the latest OPEC+ production cut agreement.The Central Asian country's cut quota under the OPEC+ deal was 390,000 bpd, from a total daily production of some 1.7 million bpd, to 1.3 million bpd, most it coming from the Tengiz field onshore and the Kashagan field in the Caspian Sea, which last year accounted for a combined daily output of 900,000 barrels of crude.The situation is sort of unique since the consortia operating Tengiz and Kashagan are led by a supermajor. The majority partner in Tengizchevroil, which operates the Tengiz field, is U.S. Supermajors Shell, Total, and Exxon are partners in the North Caspian Operating Company, developing Kashagan. Until now, the two companies have not been involved in production cuts. This time, however, they were not just asked but were about to agree, according to Reuters sources.Kazakhstan is not alone in this unprecedented position of negotiating production cuts with private field operators. Neighbour Azerbaijan with whom the country shares the Caspian Sea's oil riches, asked the BP-led consortium that operates the Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli offshore field system to start reducing its output from May. Last year, the ACG group produced some 542,000 bpd. Now, BP and its partners would need to reduce this by between 75,000 bpd and 80,000 bpd to fill the country's reduction quota, which stands at 164,000 bpd.OPEC and its partners, which besides Russia also include the Central Asian oil producers, agreed early this month to reduce its combined production by 9.7 million bpd to counter a dramatic drop in oil prices. The amount to be cut, however, is nowhere near the loss of demand resulting from travel banks and lockdowns in response to the coronavirus pandemic, suggesting that along with deliberate cuts, there will be a lot of forced well shut-ins as barrels produced remain unsold and with storage space running scarce on a global scale.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "title": "Oil Producers Insist On 'No Zero Price' Contracts",
        "content": "Following the unprecedented market carnage that saw US benchmark prices drop below zero last week, producers selling crude oil to Asian customers have started to add a new clause in their contracts under which the cost of their oil will not go below $0.00 a barrel in any circumstance, Reuters reported on Thursday, quoting numerous sources.The price of WTI Crude May futures slumped to as low as -$37 a barrel early last week, after crashing by more than 300% last Monday, a day before the WTI Crude May contract expired, as traders rushed for the exit to avoid owning physical barrels of oil for delivery in May. The negative price of oil--an industry first in the unprecedented demand collapse and oil glut--spooked sellers of oil into Asia, who started to insist on the 'no zero oil price' in their contracts, according to Reuters' sources. Alongside the slump of the WTI Crude futures into negative territory, some grades sold in Asia were being priced in the low teens because of the heavy discounts and the crashing demand. Most buyers in Asia have accepted the 'no zero price' clause, which aims to protect sellers from having to pay buyers to take their oil, Reuters' sources said. The gist of the new clause in contracts is that the price of oil cannot be lower than $0.00 \"in any circumstance,\" with a buyer at an Asian refinery confirming to Reuters that there was a new clause that stipulates the minimum price of $0.00 or $1.00 per barrel. \"No one ever expected prices to go negative!\" one of the sources, who works with an oil producer, told Reuters. Currently, most of those clauses are mostly applied to condensate--ultra-light crude--sold in Asia, as condensate is much cheaper than heavier grades and is not in high demand, according to Reuters sources. The fact that oil producers now include legal clauses to protect themselves against negative oil prices speaks volumes of the current market conditions of enormous oversupply amid collapsing demand.

        "content": "While the U.S. oil industry is in the throes of panic as demand has fallen out of the oil market, China is suffering its own oil crisis-- resulting in capex cuts for its major oil giants that seek to derail the Asian nation's ambitious plans to get a stronger foothold in the world's oil market.China's three largest state-run oil and gas companies--PetroChina, CNOOC, and Sinopec--are making significant cuts their 2020 spending plans as oil prices falter.CNOOC will cut capex this year by 11% over previously published figures. For 2020, CONOOC's capex will fall to 75-85 billion yuan (US$10.6-12.0 billion). It will not only cut capex at home, but abroad as well, including across its operations in Canada and the United States. In the United States.PetroChina is planning an even bigger cut to spending this year, to $28 billion from $41.6 billion. That's after a Q1 loss of $2.29 billion. For comparison, it saw a profit of $10.25 billion in Q1 2019, according to several media sources.Sinopec is making a 20%-25% cut to capex for 2020, to 108 billion - 115 billion yuan (US$15.2 billion to US$16.2 billion), according to a research note from Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. cited by Bloomberg.The cuts to capex for China's oil majors are a deviation from its years-long practice of pumping oil at great expense to cover the significant oil consumption needs, which have simmered down in Q1 and Q2 due to lowered industrial output due to the spread of the coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, China.As Bloomberg pointed out, China's oil industry capex cuts are in line with other global oil major capex cuts that we've seen over the last month.The price of Brent had slipped to $22.61 by Thursday morning, down from more than $65 per barrel at the beginning of the year.

Both producers and consumers benefit from a stable market,\" Petroleum Minister Tina Bru said. \"We have previously stated that we will consider a cut in Norwegian production if several big producing countries implement significant cuts. The decision by the Norwegian Government to reduce Norwegian oil production has been made on an independent basis and with Norwegian interests at heart.\"The baseline for the cuts will be 1.86 million bpd, which, according to the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate, is substantially higher than the average production rate for March, which was 1.68 million bpd. The difference means that the actual June cut will be about 70,000 bpd, based on March levels, according to Oilprice calculations.  Based on the NPD production reports, Norway's oil production rate has not exceeded 1.8 million barrels for at least four years.In addition to the cuts, however, the minister said that Norwegian oil companies would delay the startup of several new oil projects until next year, likely in hopes the price situation will have resolved itself by then.\"The cut will include oil fields on the Norwegian Continental Shelf and be fairly distributed between the fields and thereby between companies,\" Bru said. \"It will imply a limitation of production for those oil companies with ownership shares in the relevant oil fields. Gas fields are exempt.\"This would be the first time Norway has joined oil production cuts since 2002.

Overall oil and gas sales fell by 5.5 percent annually, as the lower realized oil prices couldn't offset higher production volumes. CNOOC cut its annual net production target for 2020 from 520-530 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) to 505-515 million boe.

The body that represents foreign automakers in Italy, UNRAE, reported that it expected car registrations to fall by up to 98% for the month. The Italy foreign carmakers' association is pleading with the government to approve measures to boost car demand as soon as activities reopen, according to Bloomberg. Estimates are for Italy to finish the month with total sales of between 2,500 and 2,600 units, compared to 175,654 in 2019. The total would have been even lower had Renault not registered 317 EVs in one day for a rental car company. Recall, we reported that U.S. auto sales plunged to their worst numbers in a decade for March, with April numbers expected in just days. \"The whole world is turned upside down right now,\" one U.S. auto market researcher said in late March. \"There are basically no U.S. auto sales right now,\" analyst Adam Jonas had commented.By Zerohedge.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "It would make sense for the OPEC+ coalition of oil producers to begin monitoring the group's market share to measure how effective the OPEC+ actions are, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak told news agency Interfax in an interview published on Wednesday.Asked to comment on an idea of Gazprom Neft's chief executive Alexander Dyukov that OPEC+ should switch its gauge for effectiveness of the deal by looking into the market shares of the countries part of the coalition, Novak said:\"Generally, it will be necessary to track indicators such as inventories, supply, and demand, but then it also makes sense to switch to targeting market share which belongs to OPEC+ considering the rise in global demand.\"  Oil executives in Russia, including Igor Sechin, the boss of the biggest oil producer Rosneft, have often criticized the OPEC+ pact, which began its efforts to fix the market and prop up prices in January 2017. Russian firms have argued that the OPEC+ cuts only serve to prop up U.S. shale production with higher oil prices, giving America more share on the global market at the expense of Russia and its OPEC allies in the OPEC+ deal. Many analysts saw Moscow's refusal in early March to back a collective 1.5-million-bpd cut from all OPEC+ members as the end of the Russian patience in propping up U.S. shale.The month-long spat between Russia and OPEC's leader and largest producer, Saudi Arabia, combined with the crashing global demand in the pandemic to force oil prices so low that not a single U.S. oil producer is comfortable with current prices. The U.S. shale patch is slashing capex and production to cope with the very low prices.But oil prices and demand at these levels aren't comfortable for neither Russia nor the Saudis, either. This made Russia and its now-friend-again Saudi Arabia sit down and hammer out a new OPEC+ deal to cut 9.7 million bpd production in May and June.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

This compares to net income of $141 million, or $0.34 per share, for the first quarter last year.The refiner reported an after-tax lower of cost or market, or LCM, inventory valuation adjustment of around $2.0 billion. This was the result of the market value of Valero's inventories as of March 31, 2020, falling below their historical cost, \"with the decline in market value resulting from the decline in crude oil and product market prices associated with the negative economic impacts from COVID-19,\" the company said.Valero Energy's refining segment booked an operating loss of $2.1 billion for the first quarter of 2020, compared to $479 million of operating income for Q1 2019.Looking forward, Valero expects to invest around $2.1 billion of capital this year, down by $400 million from the prior guidance. The $2.1 billion includes capital expenditures for turnarounds, catalysts, and joint venture investments.\"It's been a very challenging start to the year with significant impacts to families, communities and businesses world-wide brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic,\" Joe Gorder, Valero Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, said in a statement.Premium: 2 Stocks To Consider As Oil Nears $15With the lockdown-induced demand collapse, refiners in the United States have been cutting refinery runs over the past month. China is now processing more crude oil at its refineries than the world's top oil consumer, the United States, according to data from OilX. Gasoline prices in the U.S. continue to fall due to the oil price slump, but demand is cratering. The EIA reported demand at 5.3 million bpd last week, a slight increase, \"but still an extremely low rate compared to last April's 9.45 million b/d average,\" AAA said this week. AAA believes that the national average could continue to decrease into May, possibly dropping as low as $1.65 a gallon.\"We haven't seen gas prices that cheap since January 2009,\" AAA spokesperson Jeanette Casselano said.

        "content": "Venezuela seems to be changing tactics when it comes to managing its oil resources. PDVSA is considering a major industry reform that would increase private company activities in its troubled oil industry, according to a document seen by Reuters.This would be a far cry from its current socialist agenda that allowed only a limited role of private oil companies in the country.The document, according to Reuters, is dated March 2020, and calls on a special committee within PDVSA's planning division to restructure the industry in a way that would let private companies operate oilfields and refineries without the intervention of PDVSA. The plan also calls on PDVSA to reduce stakes in several of its oilfields.The plan was suggested last month, but came to light the same week that the United States told Chevron and Halliburton to wind down their operations in Venezuela as the waivers each were enjoying are set to expire.Venezuela's oil industry has long been floundering as years of mismanagement, underinvestment, and US sanctions have left oil infrastructure in disrepair, and crude customers in short number. As such, the country--enjoying the world's largest oil reserves--is in a state of crisis, where it has found itself stuck well before the coronavirus pandemic came onto the scene.Venezuela's oil production has fallen by more than one million barrels per day, and no longer holds the same oil-market sway as it did decades ago--something Venezuela would like to rectify.\"Given this situation, to achieve the objective of increasing production and returning Venezuela to the leading role in the oil world, it is necessary and urgent to restructure Petroleos de Venezuela,\" the document read in part.The document also came a day after leader Nicolas Maduro replaced Manuel Quevedo with a new PDVSA leader, Asdrubal Chavez, who is Hugo Chavez's cousin.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

These are the options favored by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette told media earlier this week.Mnuchin himself told media, \"This is not going to be a bailout,\" adding that they were holding discussions about \"a lot of different strategies.\"Earlier this week, a second oil company filed for bankruptcy protection after Whiting filed for Chapter 11 in mid-April. Diamond Offshore Drilling said conditions in the industry had \"worsened precipitously in recent months.\"Many expect mass bankruptcies in U.S. oil, especially in the shale patch, where debt loads tend to be high and production costs not low enough for a prolonged price depression of the sort we are witnessing right now. Earlier this month, Norway's Rystad Energy warned that as many as 533 U.S. oil companies could go bankrupt if oil stays at around $20 a barrel.West Texas Intermediate is currently trading at over $17 a barrel. While this is a lot better than the negative $37 a barrel the market saw on April 20, it is far below the breakeven rate of most U.S. oil producers.The EIA's latest weekly petroleum report provided some positive signs of returning demand for fuels. It reported an unexpected decline in gasoline stocks, and this pushed WTI higher. It's too early to say, though, whether this will be a trend or a one-off occurrence. In any case, it will take a long time for prices to recover to levels that would ensure the survival of many, if not most, U.S. oil producers.This fact certainly warrants government help, given how many jobs are at risk of disappearing.

The agency noted that the official is a close advisor to Petroleum Minister Bijan Zanganeh and an experienced negotiator who plays a central role in the formation of Iran's official position on various oil-related topics.Ardebili was also instrumental in the recovery of the Iranian oil industry after the signing of the so-called nuclear deal that put an end to UN sanctions against the country, imposed because of its uranium enrichment program.Regarding Ardebili's current state, Bloomberg quoted an Iranian government official as saying his hospitalization was unrelated to the coronavirus outbreak. The OPEC governor had had serious heart problems that prevented him from attending the OPEC meeting in March.Iran was one of the countries hardest-hit by the coronavirus, with total infections at more than 97,400 and the death toll at 6,203.The country is also suffering under the double blow of low oil prices and U.S. sanctions targeting its oil industry, which is vital for its economy. Even in such a context, Iran is still exporting oil and as it surfaced last week, helping Venezuela repair its refineries, which are operating at very low run rates because of years of mismanagement. Venezuela is reportedly paying for the services in gold.Iran is also shipping oil to Syria, despite sanctions against both countries, according to data from TankerTrackers.com. With China reducing its intake of crude from abroad amid the coronavirus epidemic in January and February, Syria may have become Iran's largest oil buyer, at least temporarily.

Chevron's last extension for its Venezuela operations expired on April 22. On that date, the Trump Administration told Chevron it had to start winding down operations in Venezuela by the beginning of December 2020.Commenting on the license to operate in Venezuela, Chevron's Wirth told CNBC: \"We don't actually operate any assets in Venezuela, we are partner in two operations that are operated by another company.\"The 90-day licenses to operate in Venezuela have gradually limited what Chevron can do in Venezuela, the company's top executive said.The current license until December doesn't require Chevron to leave Venezuela--it just restricts activity to a smaller set of allowed operations, Wirth said.Chevron operates a joint venture with Venezuela's PDVSA in the country that is home to the world's most abundant oil resources. Petroboscan, the joint venture, produced around 200,000 bpd as of October, with Chevron's share of this at 34,000 bpd. The U.S. supermajor holds a 30-percent stake in the venture. In March, the output of Petroboscan fell by more than 50 percent to 50,000 bpd from as much as 120,000 bpd just three months later.

Chevron said in its Q1 earnings report today that it is further reducing its 2020 capital expenditure (capex) guidance by up to $2 billion to $14 billion.In March, Chevron had already slashed capital expenditures, especially in the Permian, and said it was suspending its share buyback program. Chevron announced in March a cut to its 2020 capital spending plan by $4 billion, or by 20 percent, to $16 billion, to protect its dividend and balance sheet in one of the worst oil price routs in recent memory. Of the $4-billion initial capex cut, Chevron will slash $2 billion across upstream unconventionals, primarily in the Permian Basin. On the Q1 earnings front, Chevron reported on Friday sales and other operating revenues at $30 billion, down from $34 billion for Q1 2019.Earnings rose to $3.6 billion, from $2.6 billion for Q1 last year, but this past quarter's earnings were favorably impacted by a gain of $240 million from the sale of upstream assets in the Philippines, favorable tax items of $440 million in international upstream, and foreign currency effects which increased earnings by $514 million.\"Financial results in future periods are expected to be depressed as long as current market conditions persist,\" the supermajor said in a statement.The reduced capex, the previously announced suspension of share buybacks, and additional asset sales \"are consistent with our longstanding financial priorities: to protect the dividend; to prioritize capital that drives long-term value; and to maintain a strong balance sheet,\" said Michael Wirth, Chevron's chairman of the board and chief executive officer.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

Birds of a feather. This is the same terrorist airline that Iran uses to move weapons and fighters around the Middle East. These flights must stop, and countries should do their part to deny overflights, just as many have already denied landing rights to this sanctioned airline,\" Secretary Pompeo said at a press conference earlier this week.The U.S. has stepped up pressure on the Maduro regime in recent months, the latest being ordering U.S. supermajor Chevron to wind down its Venezuelan operations by the end of the year. Halliburton has also said it will suspend most of its operations in Venezuela, after Washington tightened the noose around Caracas by banning U.S. oil companies operating in the country from drilling for oil, transporting it, or providing any equipment for use in Venezuela.

Floating storage around the world is at an all-time high as traders have been booking tankers to use as floating storage to take advantage of the contango market structure and sell the crude oil at a later date when prices are higher.According to shipping sources who spoke to Reuters, there were a record 160 million barrels of oil stashed on floating storage in mid-April, double the volume of oil stored on ships at the start of the month.Supertanker owners were the early winners in the Saudi price war, the demand destruction, and the following record-high global oil glut. Shipping companies had a field day with Saudi Aramco booking tankers en masse to flood the market with oil, and with traders scrambling to charter tankers for floating storage to sell at higher prices later.The OPEC+ deal to cut production by 9.7 million bpd in May and June, and then ease those cuts to a total of 7.7 million bpd until December 2020, is set to lower demand for crude oil transportation until the end of the year, according to Lloyd's List.The frantic hunt for storage is currently supporting tanker rates, but \"the oil tanker demand outlook from second half of this year until 2022 has deteriorated significantly from lowered oil supply and an upcoming destocking cycle,\" Joakim Hannisdahl, analyst at Norwegian investment bank Cleaves Securities, said, as quoted by Lloyd's.

With rigs getting idled and wells getting shut in, thousands of jobs are at risk.And the loss may be permanent.Earlier this month, Norway's Rystad Energy warned that as many as 533 U.S. oil companies could go bankrupt if oil stays at around $20 a barrel. At the time of writing, West Texas Intermediate was trading at $19.33 a barrel but there is serious downward pressure on the benchmark from oil storage space, which is filling up fast, with analysts expecting Cushing to reach its limit before this month's end.More pain is coming for the industry. According to Rystad Energy, oil production in the Permian, Eagle Ford, and Bakken will shed 900,000 bpd, 250,000 bpd, and 400,000 bpd, respectively, during this quarter alone. That's a total 1.55 million bpd, hundreds of shut-in wells that may never produce again, and many more jobs lost as the demand for drilling, servicing, and maintaining these wells vanishes.Earlier this week, media reported that Washington was mulling over a lifeline for the industry that could include taking stakes in companies. However, an Energy Department spokesperson told the Washington Examiner a day later that there will be no stake-taking.\"The Trump Administration is not taking equity positions in or nationalizing energy companies,\" Shaylyn Hynes said. \"Media reports to the contrary are categorically false.\"This leaves loans under different financial support programs as the only way the federal government can help the struggling industry and mitigate the impact of the crisis on jobs.

China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) told Reuters on Thursday that it had asked Bank of China to look into its crude futures-linked product. The regulator has also called on banks to carefully assess risk when offering and structuring products linked to crude oil price swings, CBIRC told Reuters.The commission has also told banks to suspend new sales of wealth management products that can amass unlimited losses for the investor.The consequences of last week's negative WTI Crude prices went far and wide, burning even retail Chinese investors who aren't allowed to invest in the international crude oil futures markets directly.Chinese retail investors cannot directly trade WTI Crude or Brent Crude, but Chinese state-held lenders offer structured products with exposure to the price swings of the two most active international crude benchmarks.For example, Bank of China has a paper investment structured product for retail investors linked to international futures contracts, including WTI Crude and Brent Crude. The bank sells this product, Yuan You Bao, to individual clients. Other banks such as Agricultural Bank of China (ABC), Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), China Construction Bank (CCB), and Bank of Communications (BoComm) also have similar crude-linked products.Last week, following the turmoil in international oil markets, Bank of China suspended the opening of new positions in its product. Investors started complaining that they weren't adequately informed of the actual risks of betting on crude oil price swings. Sources with knowledge of the matter told Caixin Global that Bank of China's Yuan You Bao product alone burnt more than 60,000 Chinese retail investors with a total of US$1.4 billion (10 billion yuan).

Iraq's production declined because of lower exports, while Kuwait--the fourth-largest oil producer in OPEC--also boosted output, the Reuters survey found.As of May 1, OPEC is preparing to cut production as part of the new OPEC+ deal to take a total of 9.7 million bpd off the market in May and June.Saudi Arabia is said to have already started cutting its oil production ahead of the official start of the new OPEC+ pact on Friday, while Kuwait said last week it had already started to reduce crude oil supply to international markets, \"sensing a responsibility responding to market conditions.\" Still, before the cuts begin in May, crude oil supply from OPEC soared by more than 2 million bpd in April to the highest levels since December 2018, oil-flow tracking company Petro-Logistics said earlier this week.As the new deal enters into force on Friday, the market will be closely following reports about production and supply from OPEC and its allies in an attempt to gauge if and how the new cuts could alleviate the global glut amid collapsing demand.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Armed militants, believed to be affiliated with one of the sons of eastern Libyan strongman General Khalifa Haftar, stormed during the weekend the headquarters of Brega Oil Marketing Company in the eastern city of Benghazi, expelling the firm's director, The Libya Observer reported on Monday.  The armed group replaced Brega Oil Marketing Company's director Khairallah Al-Ubaidi, after reports that the manager supported efforts for a political agreement in restive Libya, rather than backing General Haftar's announcement that his Libyan National Army (LNA) had accepted a \"popular mandate\" to rule Libya.At the beginning of last week, General Haftar said that his army would take formal control of Libya, \"answering the will of the people.\"Haftar launched in the spring of last year a campaign to take Libya's capital Tripoli. In January this year, a group of paramilitary formations affiliated with Haftar's LNA occupied Libya's export terminals along with pipelines and fields. The blockade came amid continued fighting between the LNA, which is loyal to the eastern Libyan government and the forces loyal to the Government of National Accord (GNA), which is recognized by the United Nations.As a result of the blockade, Libya's oil production -which had stood at more than 1 million bpd at the start of January - has collapsed to less than 100,000 bpd. Over the past month, Haftar's forces have lost some ground to groups aligned with the GNA, and Haftar ordered his troops to halt operations during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. The GNA rejected the unilateral ceasefire, saying it doesn't trust the eastern military commander.  Libya's National Oil Corporation (NOC) said last week that as of April 28, oil production in the country was down to just 95,077 barrels a day. The forced restriction of oil and gas production has caused Libya financial losses exceeding US$4.35 billion since mid-January, said the NOC, calling again on \"all parties to lift the blockade and re-start oil and gas production.\"By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Shell's Philippines unit will suspend refining operations at its 110,000-bpd refinery in the country for a month starting in the middle of May, due to the dramatic plunge in fuel demand and the erosion of refining margins in the COVID-19 pandemic.  \"In response to the drastic decline in local product demand and the significant deterioration of regional refining margins brought about the COVID-19 pandemic, the company will temporarily shut down its refinery operations for approximately one month starting mid-May 2020,\" Pilipinas Shell Petroleum Corporation said in a statement carried by Reuters.\"The temporary shutdown will help insulate the company from further potential drops in refining margins and will also aid in its cash conservation initiatives,\" Shell's unit in the Philippines, operator of one of the two refineries in the country, said.At the Q1 earnings call last week, Shell's chief executive, Ben van Beurden, said that the oil supermajor and one of the largest oil product retailers globally is not sure when fuel demand would recover to pre-crisis levels, if at all.\"We are looking at a major demand destruction that we don't even know that will come back. So the oil price may come back. But if the volumes are significantly lower, we still have a major dislocation, of course, in our own cash wheel,\" van Beurden said at the call after announcing a first dividend cut at Shell since World War II.Meanwhile, the Philippines - which had 9,684 cases of Covid-19, including 637 deaths from the disease as of early on Tuesday - is under strict lockdowns in the capital city Manila and other major cities until the middle of May.On Monday, the President of the Philippines, Rodrigo Duterte, signed an executive order to raise import tariffs on crude oil and refined oil products by another 10 percent to finance actions to curb the spread of COVID-19 and economic measures to support the citizens and the economy.

        "content": "Bank of China has told its clients that it would pick up the tab for part of the $1.4-billion total loss that its retail customers amassed from investing in a crude oil futures-linked product, several Chinese retail investors told Bloomberg on Tuesday.Bank of China, one of the largest lenders in the country, has a paper investment structured product for retail investors linked to international futures contracts, including WTI Crude and Brent Crude.The structured product linked to oil benchmarks burnt many Chinese investors in last month's market carnage when WTI Crude prices plunged to a negative -$37 a barrel.  The consequences of the negative WTI Crude prices went far and wide, burning even retail Chinese investors who aren't allowed to invest in the international crude oil futures markets directly. Sources with knowledge of the matter told Caixin Global that Bank of China's Yuan You Bao product alone burnt more than 60,000 Chinese retail investors with a total of US$1.4 billion (10 billion yuan). Following the turmoil in international oil markets, Bank of China suspended the opening of new positions in its oil-linked product. Meanwhile, retail investors started complaining that they weren't adequately informed of the actual risks of betting on crude oil price swings. Last week, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC), the financial industry regulator of China, asked Bank of China to investigate problems regarding the oil-linked product. The regulator also called on all commercial banks to reassess the risk when offering and structuring products linked to crude oil price swings. According to the Chinese retail investors who spoke to Bloomberg this week, Bank of China has told customers via the phone that apart from absorbing some of the losses on the oil-linked product, it would also return 20 percent of the initial investment to some of its clients.

        "title": "IEA Chief Calls For Boost To Battery And Hydrogen Technology",
        "content": "The executive director of the International Energy Agency (IEA), Fatih Birol, said that the turmoil in the oil sector caused by the covid-19 pandemic gives governments the perfect opportunity to embrace green energy as a source of jobs that also serves climate goals.In an interview with Reuters, Birol said that not only well-established technologies, such as those behind solar and wind generation should receive a boost, but also lithium-ion batteries and the use of electrolysis to produce hydrogen from water should be candidates for subsidies and policy support.Besides being the backbone of electric vehicles and electronic devices, li-ion batteries are becoming more and more important in solar and wind farms to store energy when nature is not doing its part. \"Lithium-ion batteries are now a technology opportunity for the wider energy sector, well beyond just transport,\" a recent report by the IEA states. \"There is a need for manufacturing capacity to grow further. Assuming that the global auto industry's announced targets for electric vehicle production are met despite the covid-19 crisis, around 1,000 GWh of battery manufacturing capacity would be needed in 2025. This output would require the equivalent of 50 plants, each on the scale of a Tesla Gigafactory.\"When it comes to electrolysers, which are devices that split water into hydrogen and oxygen using electrical energy and are considered a way to produce clean hydrogen from low-carbon electricity, research is moving towards making them a viable option for the mass transportation, shipping, aviation, long-haul trucks, the iron and steel and chemical industries.\"The deployment of electrolysers has also picked up in recent years, both in terms of the number and the size of the projects,\" the IEA document reads. \"Over the last three years, several projects were in the range of 1 MW to 5 MW, with the largest at 6 MW. In Japan, a 10?MW project just started operating, and a 20?MW project in Canada is under construction. Larger projects in the hundreds of megawatts have been announced. As a result, the next two years could set new records, with announced projects bringing the global installation of electrolyser capacity from 170 MW in 2019 to 730 MW in 2021.\"Globally, there is growing interest in the development of efficient solutions to produce and store renewable energy. So much so that, for the first time ever, green power overtook coal as a source of electricity generation in 2019.Figures from the IEA itself show that, overall, fossil fuels dropped by 245 TWh last year, while renewables production rose by 119 TWh from 2018 to 2019.In Birol's view, however, the oil sector should not be demonized as not only its products are to be used for years to come but also because many of such petrochemical products, such as sanitizers, have proven to be important in the face of the novel coronavirus pandemic.By Mining.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "French supermajor Total proved more resilient than some peers in the first quarter, remaining profitable despite a 35-percent decline in net income to $1.8 billion. The company said it would continue to distribute dividends, unchanged from last year's first quarter.Total also declared a goal of becoming net neutral in terms of carbon dioxide emissions by 2050 despite the challenging oil price environment. Noting that this was in line with European Union emissions goals, the French supermajor said it is already working to reduce its carbon footprint by expanding its renewable energy operations. During the first quarter, Total said it accessed close to 6 GW in new renewable power generation capacity across the world.At the same time, the company would continue to pursue lower breakeven prices, to which end, Total said, it acquired Tullow Oil's interests in Uganda.Total is betting big on renewables. The company eyes some 25 GW in renewable power generation capacity by 2025. To achieve this, Total has been expanding in the industry through acquisitions. It now has a presence along the supply chain and is further expanding it. Recently, Total joined the Erebus offshore wind project: a floating wind farm off the Welsh coast that will have a capacity of close to 100 MW.During the first quarter of the year alone, Total bought a 50-percent stake in a solar farm portfolio in India, totaling 2 GW in installed capacity. To this, it added the purchase of Global Wind Power France, which has a portfolio of 1 GW in capacity and the launch of a 25-MW battery storage facility in France.At the same time, Total boasted two significant discoveries during the first quarter in Surinam. The company also struck gas condensate in the North Sea. For the rest of the year, the company will cut its net investments by 25 percent to $14 billion.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "title": "Renewables Overtake Coal In U.S. In Electricity Generation",
        "content": "Hydropower plants, solar farms, and wind farms generated more electricity than coal in the United States for a record 40 days in a row, the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis said in a new report.The IEEFA had earlier forecast that renewables, including hydropower, would exceed coal in terms of electricity generation next year. But if the April trend continues, this target would be reached this year, the organization said.Warm weather, low gas prices, and a substantial expansion in renewable installations at the end of 2019 all contributed to the performance of the segment, the IEEFA report noted, but so did the fall in demand for electricity brought about by the coronavirus outbreak.While this is certainly good news, not all is well in renewables. Last month, a group of organizations working to expand the share of renewables in the United States' energy mix warned that the pandemic was causing a loss of jobs in renewable energy, and this loss could reach half a million.Environmental Entrepreneurs (E2), the American Council on Renewable Energy, E4TheFuture, and B.W. Research Partnership analyzed jobs data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and found that besides the 106,000 people who had already lost their jobs in renewable energy, more than half a million could also be out of their jobs over the next few months.Despite this danger, the renewables industry in the U.S. has grown strongly during the first quarter. In just January and February, solar, wind, and hydropower accounted for as much as 85.7 percent of new generation capacity, FERC data showed. According to the data, solar, wind, and hydropower will continue expanding while fossil fuel-fired generation capacity will decline over the next three years.In that, the U.S. reflects a broader global trend of new renewable capacity additions outpacing fossil fuels. The trend will likely slow down this year because of the economic fallout from the pandemic, but this will probably be just a temporary hurdle along the way.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "While OPEC begins to scale back oil production to offset at least partially some of the world's excess oil supply, Venezuela was busy ramping up its oil exports--even in the face of US sanctions and Rosneft pulling the plug on its dealings with PDVSA.After the United States sanctioned two Rosneft subsidiaries for propping up the Maduro regime by reselling oil and oil products from Venezuela to other markets including Asia, Rosneft pulled back, sending Venezuela's March oil exports to lows not seen since mid-2019.But in April, its exports recovered somewhat, Reuters said on Monday, as it found new shippers and resellers for its oil cargoes, including Mexico's Libre Abordo and Schlager Business Group who have engaged in an oil-for-corn-and-water pact with Venezuela.The Mexico companies are adamant that its dealings with Venezuela are strictly humanitarian in nature and that they did not violate U.S. sanctions. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, however, announced last week that both the U.S. Embassy and Mexico are investing the matter on suspicion that they might be serving as shell companies for the purposes of skirting U.S. sanctions, according to Reuters.Venezuela exported roughly nearly 850,000 bpd of crude oil and refined products in April--nearly 35,000 bpd more than in March.The top destinations for Venezuela's crude and crude products exports are China and India, although they are mainly end-users, and typically use intermediaries like Rosneft and the new Mexico companies to get the oil that would otherwise fall under the strict U.S. sanctions.Despite finding two new middle men to replace a nervous Rosneft, Venezuela's oil inventories are still high at roughly 30 million barrels as the U.S. sanctions have restricted buyers of PDVSA's oil to a small few.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

Back then, the company exported 771,000 bpd of oil.  From January to April, China was Petrobras's top export market, with 60 percent of all oil sales.The company is following the international situation closely and is assessing all markets, Chief Refining and Gas Natural Officer, Anelise Lara, said in a statement. Petrobras expects to continue its good exports performance, thanks to the recovery of demand in China, Lara added.While Petrobras is boasting record oil exports, it has reduced its oil production in response to the low oil prices. In early April, Petrobras set its April oil production target at 2.07 bpd, after having reduced production by 200,000 bpd.\"The company continues monitoring the market and, if necessary, will make new adjustments always ensuring safety conditions for people, operations and processes,\" said Petrobras, the largest producer in the South American country, which not part of the OPEC+ group.Petrobras has also started shutting down production at 62 offshore platforms in the shallow waters off its coast, Reuters reported in mid-April, adding that the cuts will amount to 23,000 bpd.Days before the production cuts at the OPEC+ group formally began on May 1, Petrobras said that it had reversed the cuts announced in early April, opting for \"the gradual return to an average oil production level of 2.26 MMbpd in April alongside an increase in the utilization factor of our refineries,\" due to better than expected demand for its products.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Gasoline and diesel demand in the world's third-largest oil importer, India, crashed by around 60 percent annually in April due to the nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of the coronavirus, two industry sources told Reuters on Monday.India - with a population of 1.3 billion people - went into a nationwide lockdown at the end of March. The lockdown has since been extended to the middle of May.In April, gasoline and diesel sales in India collapsed by 61 percent and 57 percent on the year, respectively, provisional industry data provided to Reuters by the sources showed. At the beginning of April, the demand crash was more pronounced, with gasoline sales down 61 percent and diesel sales crashing by 64 percent in the first half of the month.Due to the lockdown and to India's struggles to contain the spread of the coronavirus, fuel demand is plummeting, so refineries are cutting run rates and struggling to store crude and refined products in the dwindling available storage capacity.Last month, Indian Oil Corp (IOC), the country's biggest refiner and fuel retailer, was said to have declared a force majeure on oil imports from some of its top oil suppliers, including Saudi Arabia.Due to plummeting fuel demand and overflowing storage capacity, at least three oil refiners in India have asked for lower crude oil imports for May from the Middle East, including from the world's top exporter, Saudi Arabia, officials at the refiners told Reuters last month.With demand collapsing, India's oil refiners have already filled 95 percent of their combined storage capacity for fuel of 85 million barrels, officials at three state oil refiners told Bloomberg at the end of April. Even the tanks at the 66,000 fuel stations in India are full, as more than a billion people are under lockdown.In the first two weeks of April, India's consumption of gasoline and diesel--more than half of the country's oil demand--crashed by over 60 percent, according to Bloomberg estimates.

Other details were not disclosed.Tesla, which reported a surprising profit for the first quarter despite the coronavirus outbreak, has been expanding its presence in battery storage alongside its growth in EVs. Its solar business, however, has not been doing all that well. For the first quarter of the year, Tesla reported $325 million in power generation and storage product sales revenue, a decline from the end of 2019. Elon Musk explained the decline with \"Covid essentially shut us down.\"Even so, Musk has made no secret of his plans to expand Tesla's presence in energy, to the point of becoming more an energy company than a car company. Last year, Electrek reported on Musk's plan to turn Tesla into a distributed global utility, and now it has followed up with a report on the release of a new product: the Autobidder.\"Autobidder provides independent power producers, utilities and capital partners the ability to autonomously monetize battery assets,\" Tesla explains. \"Autobidder is a real-time trading and control platform that provides value-based asset management and portfolio optimization, enabling owners and operators to configure operational strategies that maximize revenue according to their business objectives and risk preferences.\"It seems the foundation of Tesla's distributed utility business will be its battery storage business.\"Batteries are highly flexible assets, but they require smart strategies and software to realize their full value. Autobidder allows owners to realize this value by handling the complex co-optimization required to successfully stack multiple value streams simultaneously,\" Tesla says.In this context, an expansion into the electricity sector of the UK, which has some of the most renewables-friendly legislation, looks like a logical step in Tesla's energy plans. Later this year, the company is holding a \"Battery Day\", when the company will share \"a lot of exciting news. And I think it would be one of the most exciting days in Tesla's history,\" CEO Musk said, as quoted by Inverse.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

The 2019 drop in CO2 emissions in the energy sector offset the prior year's increase in those emissions, which was the only annual rise in CO2 energy-related emissions in the past five years.In 2018, higher natural gas consumption due to extreme summer and winter weather and increased petroleum demand in transportation in a strong economy resulted in the United States reversing several years of CO2 emissions reductions in the energy sector. Back in 2018, U.S. energy-related CO2 emissions increased compared to 2017, primarily due to the higher emissions from natural gas and petroleum. The emissions increase in 2018 was the first such annual rise since 2014, the EIA said in November 2019. Even with the 2018 rise, the emissions in 2018 were still 12 percent lower than the energy-related emissions back in 2005, according to EIA's data series. By 2019, U.S. energy-related CO2 emissions had declined by 15 percent from their peak in 2007, the EIA said today.U.S. CO2 emissions from petroleum fuels--nearly half of which are associated with gasoline consumption--dropped by 0.8 percent annually, while CO2 emissions from the use of natural gas rose by 3.3 percent. CO2 emissions from coal fell by 14.6 percent - the largest annual percentage drop in any fuel's CO2 emissions in EIA's annual CO2 data series dating back to 1973, due to continuous coal fleet retirements.According to EIA data, the United States now emits less CO2 from coal than from motor gasoline.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

It's hard to pin down because net worth is a (downward) moving target these days.Sawiris told CNBC that he would buy airline stocks. At the same time, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway dumped all of its airline holdings after losing nearly $50 billion in Q1. The selloff hit the airlines hard.Sawiris not only talked up investing in oil, which he said could reach $100 per barrel but spoke out to CNBC against Saudi Arabia and Russia, who Sawiris alleges were trying to kill off the U.S. shale industry. Sawiris also told the network that he supported U.S. President Donald Trump's plan to reopen the American economy.\"They might not find the cure, they might not find the vaccine, so how long are we going to be in prison in our homes?\" Sawiris asked.It is precisely this reopening that is the oil industry's most promising--or rather, the only--path forward, as current demand destruction is too much for the heavily indebted US shale industry to bear forever--particularly when combined with overproduction from OPEC and its allies up until now.Sawiris has been a champion of the reopen movement, stating as far back as a month ago that he would commit suicide if the lockdown measures were not rescinded within two weeks.Air traffic is down 90%, with airlines currently losing $10 billion monthly, according to Barron's, who reported on Wednesday that Citi analyst Stephen Trent shares also thinks that this might be a good time to buy into at least one airline: United.Air traffic is a significant component of the transportation industry's demand for crude oil and crude oil products.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Researchers at the Korea Institute of Science and Technology have developed a high-capacity lithium-ion battery that is flexible enough to be stretched. Led by senior researcher Jeong Gon Son, the team created an accordion-like micro-structure, which gives structural stretchability to non-stretchable materials, and thus constructed a micro-inwardly curved electrode framework in a honeycomb shape. The inwardly protruded honeycomb framework consisted of atom-thick graphene, which serves as a curtain, and carbon nanotubes, which formed a nano-size rope.In a paper published in the journal ACS Nano, the scientists said they were able to make the honeycomb-shaped composite framework inwardly protruded using a radial compression process. This process resembles the rolling of Korean rice rolls, or gimbap, and it resulted in the creation of stretchable properties.The structurally stretchable electrode consists solely of electrode materials and it was assembled with a stretchable gel electrolyte and stretchable packaging. These elements block air and moisture and keep the electrolytes from leaking. According to the proponents, the resulting stretchable battery showed high areal capacity of 5.05 mAh/cm2, superior electrochemical performance up to 50% strain under repeated (up to 500) stretch-release cycles and long-term stability of 95.7% after 100 cycles in air conditions.\"The stretchable lithium-ion battery developed through this research is expected to present a new paradigm in terms of stretchable energy storage systems for the further development of wearable and body-implantable electronic devices,\" Jeong Gon Son said in a media statement.In the researcher's view, the fast-growing market for high-performance wearable devices has increased the need for energy storage mechanisms to be designed in flexible and stretchable forms that mimic human skin and organs.By Mining.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

Lee, the top performance by Tesla's Model 3 in April was due to the fact that the UK had just scrapped, as of early April, the company car tax for electric vehicles, and to Tesla's policy for direct sales with delivery to consumers bypassing dealerships, all of which are closed in many European countries amid the lockdowns.Elsewhere in Europe, new car sales numbers in April were equally dismal as they were in the UK.Italy's new car registrations numbered just 2,182 vehicles last month, down by 98 percent from 107,930 car registrations in April 2019. Car sales in France slumped by 90 percent on the year, while new vehicle registrations in Spain crashed by 96 percent. The UK, Italy, Spain, and France are the largest auto markets in Europe - together with Germany - but they are also the hotspots of the coronavirus pandemic in Europe, with strict lockdowns imposed by authorities in March and April.  In the US, the picture in April was not as bleak as it was in Europe, although many automakers reported sales at their lowest levels in decades. Dealers and executives hope that prospective buyers will return once they emerge from the lockdowns, the Wall Street Journal reported last week.

        "content": "Suncor Energy is axing its quarterly dividend by 55 percent to reduce its cash breakeven to a WTI Crude price of US$35 a barrel, one of Canada's biggest oil firms said on Wednesday.Suncor made the statement when reporting a huge Q1 loss due to impairments stemming from the low oil prices. \"[A]fter taking significant action in reducing capital and operating costs, the Board believes that reducing the current level of dividends is required to drive down the cash breakeven of the company to a WTI price of US$35 per barrel,\" Mark Little, president and chief executive officer at Suncor Energy, said in a statement.   Suncor Energy's Board has decided to cut the quarterly cash dividend by 55 percent to US$0.15 (C$0.21) per common share.As early as in March, Suncor announced cuts to its oil production and spending for this year, as did all Canadian, American, and international oil companies in response to the oil price collapse.Today, Suncor said that \"At a WTI price of US$35 per barrel, all planned operating and administration costs, sustaining capital and dividends can be covered from operating revenue, once demand returns.\"Suncor reported today a net loss of US$2.5 billion (C$3.525 billion) for Q1 2020, compared to net earnings of US$1.05 billion (C$1.470 billion) for the prior-year quarter, due to low oil prices and non?cash after?tax asset impairment charges.  \"The company's results in the first quarter of 2020 were impacted by the significant weakness and volatility in commodity prices, compared to the prior year quarter, as a result of the COVID?19 pandemic and OPEC+'s initial plan to increase production,\" Suncor said in an unsurprising recap of the events in Q1 which was the highlight of every oil firm's results release this earnings season.   Suncor joins other Canadian and major international companies that touched the dividend to protect their balance sheets in the current weak operating and price environment. Cenovus Energy, for example, announced last week a temporary suspension of the dividend after swinging to a Q1 loss, while Husky Energy slashed dividends by 90 percent as it also posted a loss. Last week, Shell announced its first dividend cut since World War II.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "U.S. oil production could decline this year by 2 million bpd-3 million bpd, due to limited storage capacity and low oil prices, Russia's Deputy Energy Minister Pavel Sorokin told local media on Wednesday.  \"We see that the production drop in the United States may range from 2 to 3 mln barrels daily this year either on account of storage capacities filling or merely because it is not possible for certain companies to work in the conditions of the price being $30-35 [per barrel], to say nothing of $20 [per barrel],\" Sorokin said in an interview with the Roscongress Foundation carried by TASS.   Apart from large production cuts in the United States, curtailments in Canada could top 800,000 bpd, so those two North American producers could provide between 2.8 million bpd and 4 million bpd of cuts from producers that are not part of the OPEC+ pact, Sorokin said.For the United States, Rystad Energy expected in mid-April that oil production would drop by 1.5 million bpd by the end of 2020. Around that time, Wood Mackenzie expected U.S. Lower 48 supply to be 2.6 million bpd below its pre-price collapse forecasts for end 2021. The 2.6-million-bpd drop through 2021 assumes that in response to the lower oil price, operators would cut more than 100 rigs from the Permian basin by the end of May 2020 and over 200 rigs, or 25 percent, across all plays by the end of June.Related: Why Russia Finally Accepted Deeper Oil Output CutsIn total, low oil prices could force 4 million bpd of non-OPEC supply out of the market, WoodMac's Global Oil Supply team has estimated.According to Russia's deputy energy minister Sorokin, global commercial oil inventories could start declining in the third quarter this year if countries begin to ease the lockdowns.The OPEC+ pact participants are motivated to cut production because the \"penalty\" in the absence of actions is a new market collapse, and no one is interested in that, Sorokin said.Referring to Russia's uneasy task to cut 2 million bpd as part of the OPEC+ deal, he said that Moscow expects to achieve \"the maximum reduction level as soon as practicable.\"By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Iraq, OPEC's second-largest producer and the biggest cheater in previous production cut deals, faces problems in the new OPEC+ deal as well.  Iraq's compliance with the deal is yet again in question, as negotiations with oil majors about which oilfields should cut production continue, even as the historic agreement entered into force nearly a week ago.Iraq hasn't informed yet its key oil customers about how much the country's crude exports will be because of protracted talks with international oil companies, which have been further complicated by Iraq's inability to form a new government, industry and trade sources told Reuters on Wednesday.  As part of the OPEC+ deal, Iraq needs to cut around 1 million barrels per day (bpd) of its production, which stood at 4.585 million bpd in March 2020, as per OPEC's secondary sources in its latest Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR).But Iraq has yet to agree how the cuts should be divided among the many major Iraqi oilfields, most of which are operated by international majors, including ExxonMobil, BP, Eni, and Lukoil, a spokesman for the Iraqi state-owned Basra Oil Company (BOC) told Reuters.\"Talks with international oil companies are still continuing to discuss ways of curtailing production that serve all parties and ensure mutual interests are observed,\" the spokesman told Reuters, adding that he hopes a breakthrough could be reached soon.According to an industry source in Iraq who spoke to Reuters, international oil firms refuse to cut production, while talks are further complicated by Iraq's problems in forming a new government.Related: This Could Be The Beginning Of A Tremendous Oil RallyThat's why Iraq hasn't yet informed its key oil buyers of its export schedule, which is a standard - albeit not obligatory - practice in the industry. The other large Middle Eastern producers from OPEC - Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Kuwait - have already told their clients that they would be cutting exports, according to Reuters' sources.Iraq was the biggest laggard in all previous OPEC+ cuts, and it's no surprise that it continues to struggle to pull off some semblance of compliance with the cuts.  Another serial laggard in compliance, Nigeria, was also trying to figure out how and from where to cut production as part of the deal, and was still negotiating with the oil majors, days before the cuts entered into force.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Occidental Petroleum booked a net loss of $2.2 billion for the first quarter of the year, attributing most of it to goodwill impairment charges of $1.4 billion and equity investment losses from Western Midstream Partners.The company said it had reduced its capital spending program for the year by more than 50 percent, to $2.4-2.6 billion, and had identified spending cuts worth some $1.2 billion to be realized this year.The oil price crash and oversupply crisis battered Occidental just months after it completed the acquisition of Anadarko, which has arguably become the most ill-timed acquisition in the industry. It cost Oxy $55 billion and expanded its presence in U.S. shale, which is now also being beaten into the ground by low oil prices, much below breakeven points.Following the acquisition, Oxy was saddled with a total debt load of some $40 billion that it is now looking to reduce, the Wall Street Journal reported. The company has hired investment bank Moelis & Co. to help it with this.Occidental has about $11 billion in debt maturing by 2022, Bloomberg reported last month and is desperately trying to conserve cash. To this end, it issued $257 million worth of new shares in mid-April--at prices at the time--to pay a dividend to Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, which lent the oil company $10 billion to buy Anadarko.Because of the unfortunate timing of its acquisition of Anadarko, Oxy has become one of the worst-affected oil players in the United States. Asset sales, one of the usual means of reducing significant debt loads, will fetch a lot less than before the crisis if they go through at all.French Total, for example, told Oxy that it wouldn't be able to buy its business in Algeria as it had planned because of objections from the country's government. Other deals will be hard to come by amid spending budget cuts, which puts Oxy in a rather difficult position where it has no other hope than a fast recovery in prices.

        "content": "The American Petroleum Institute (API) estimated on Tuesday another large crude oil inventory build, of 8.440 million barrels for the week ending May 1 as the demand destruction continues and storage space nears its upper limits.Today's inventory build was expected to be 8.125 million barrels.In the previous week, the API estimated a large build in crude oil inventories of 9.978 million barrels, while the EIA's estimates were for a slightly smaller build of 9.0 million barrels for that week.Oil prices were trading up on Tuesday afternoon prior to the API's data release, as the market starts to muster up hope that OPEC production cuts that were supposed to go into effect on May 1 will combine with increased oil demand on the global front, which Goldman Sachs suggests has risen by 2.5 million barrels per day from its 2020 low point in mid-April. Along with lower supplies expected out of OPEC, the United States is seeing its own drop in production, from 13.1 million bpd at its height to 12.1 million bpd for April 24, according to the Energy Information Administration.At 12:14 pm EDT on Tuesday the WTI benchmark was trading up on the day by $3.22 (+14.14%) at $26--double the price from this time last week. The price of a Brent barrel was also trading up on Tuesday, by $3.29 (+12.10%), at $30.49--up roughly $10 per barrel week on week.The API reported a draw of 2.237 million barrels of gasoline for week ending May 1, after last week's 1.108-million-barrel draw. This week's build compares to analyst expectations for a 325,000-barrel build for the week.Distillate inventories were up by 6.143 million barrels for the week, compared to last week's 5.462-barrel build, while Cushing inventories saw a gain of 2.681 million barrels.At 4:33 pm EDT, WTI was trading at $24.60 while Brent was trading at $31.11.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Due to ongoing production cuts from Canadian oil producers and to increased storage capacity, the price of Canada's heavy oil soared early this week to its smallest discount to the U.S. WTI Crude futures in at least 12 years, data from NE2 Group and Bloomberg showed.  The price of the June contract of Western Canadian Select (WCS), the benchmark price of oil from Canada's oil sands delivered at Hardisty, Alberta, was just US$3.80 per barrel lower than the price of the WTI Crude June contract early on Tuesday, according to NE2 Group.This discount of Canadian heavy oil to WTI Crude was the smallest gap in prices since at least 2008, according to Bloomberg data dating back to 2008.The two key reasons for stronger WCS prices this week are the ongoing production cuts by many Canadian oil producers and an announcement by pipeline operator Enbridge that it was offering a portion of a pipeline for storage.  Canadian oil firms have been reducing spending and output at many heavy oil projects in Alberta, due to the unsustainably low oil prices and the demand crash in the COVID-19 pandemic.Related: The Texas Oil Production Cut Plan Is DeadHusky Energy has cut its budget and production, Cenovus Energy slashed its 2020 capital spending by around 32 percent, Suncor cut capital guidance, and so did Canadian Natural Resources. Athabasca Oil Corporation also cut its capex and proactively curtailed heavy oil production at Hangingstone. ConocoPhillips is reducing production at Surmont.Analysts expect that the companies will announce curtailments in production to the tune of around 1 million bpd in the coming months.In another bullish development for Canadian oil prices, Enbridge said on Monday that it was offering 900,000 barrels of oil, for an eight-month term, to be stored in a portion of the Line 3 pipeline between Regina, Saskatchewan, and Cromer, Manitoba. The portion of the pipeline would serve as temporary, regulated storage before the pipeline is decommissioned next year, Enbridge said, noting that \"This temporary storage, along with the further maintenance optimizations to our storage tank program, will create more than two million barrels of additional storage capacity for 2020.\" By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

Consequently, we expect activity in North America land to sharply decline during the second quarter and remain depressed through year-end, impacting all basins,\" CEO Jeff Miller said in comments on the results.The last downturn between 2014 and 2016 cost the U.S. oil industry some 200,000 jobs. Many of these were in oilfield services, as companies lowered their rates to stay afloat and minimized all spend. Now, unless we see a quick reversal in the industry's fortunes, things could end up even worse because of the combination of supply overhang and demand depression.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "One of Canada's largest oil and gas companies, Canadian Natural Resources, kept its dividend intact after swinging to a loss for Q1, while Canada's producers are scaling back production by around 1 million bpd amid low oil prices and demand.Canadian Natural Resources reported a loss of US$918 million (C$1.28 billion) for the first quarter this year, compared to a profit of US$689 million (C$961 million) for Q1 2019. However, unlike its Canadian peers, the company maintained its dividend.    \"The strength of the Company's assets and its ability to generate significant and sustainable free cash flow over the long term combined with strong liquidity, production flexibility, significant capital reductions and targeted operating costs savings provided the Board of Directors with the confidence that the Company's current dividend levels can be sustained through the commodity price cycle,\" Canadian Natural Resources said in a statement.Canadian Natural Resources' approach differs from many other Canadian firms, which cut dividends after reporting Q1 losses due to the price crash. Earlier this week, Suncor Energy said it was axing its quarterly dividend by 55 percent to reduce its cash breakeven to a WTI Crude price of US$35 a barrel. Cenovus Energy announced last week a temporary suspension of the dividend after swinging to a Q1 loss, while Husky Energy slashed dividends by 90 percent as it also posted a loss.While Canadian Natural Resources kept its dividend, it withdrew its production guidance for 2020. It also said it would curtail some production at high-cost conventional projects in North America and oil sands operations, and carry out planned turnaround activities at oil sands projects in the second half of 2020.Related: U.S. Oil Companies Are Cutting Production Much Faster Than Expected\"[B]est we can tell is probably about 1 million barrels that is soft line here in Alberta, Western Canada. And if you look not only at ourselves, but many companies, we're all looking to look for creative ways to take barrels off the system,\" Canadian Natural's president Tim McKay said on the conference call.\"So I would suspect that you will see a larger amount of oil come off the system as every company looks for an opportunity to do maintenance during a low pricing period and take oil off the system,\" he said.According to pipeline operator Enbridge, \"Obviously, Western Canadian producers have been hit hard.

        "content": "A $10-billion tax deferral plan proposed by the Norwegian government has prompted two oil industry executives to voice concern that it would do nothing to support the sustainability of the oil industry in Europe's largest producer, Bloomberg reports.The chief executives of Equinor and Aker ASA said that while the plan will improve oil companies' liquidity, it does nothing to address risks related to production capacity and the startup of new projects.\"Changes to the proposal are required in order to avoid significant and permanent reduction in capacity and competency for the Norwegian supplier industry,\" said Aker ASA's chief executive Oyvind Eriksen.Equinor's CEO, Eldar Saetre, said the government's tax deferral would force the company to delay the start of several new projects.The Norwegian government proposed the tax deferral plan at the end of last month, hoping to prevent a slump in investments. It boils down to letting companies write off investments more quickly, Reuters reported at the time, allowing them to delay paying taxes. It would also make their taxable income lower, allowing them to take more substantial deductions on new investments.\"Even if the government pursues a policy of becoming less dependent on oil, it's important to prevent the current crisis from making the decline so rapid that we lose key competence that will help the transition,\" Prime Minister Erna Solberg said at the time.The proposed measures may be positive for exclusively Norway-focused companies, but Equinor also has operations outside the country, which would limit the benefits of the tax deferrals, a local energy analyst told Reuters in April.Norway agreed last month to cut its oil production by 250,000 bpd in June and then maintain 134,000-bpd lower production until the end of the year.The baseline for the cuts will be 1.86 million bpd, which, according to the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate, is substantially higher than the average production rate for March, which was 1.68 million bpd. The difference means that the actual June cut will be about 70,000 bpd, based on March levels, according to Oilprice calculations.  By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

Separately, PDVSA postponed the restart of the Petromonagas and Petrocedeno facilities because of depressed oil prices.Petromonagas is a joint venture of PDVSA with Rosneft, which earlier this year sold all its interests in Venezuela to a newly formed state firm called Roszarubezhneft. Petrocedeno is a partnership between PDVSA, French Total, and Norway's Equinor.A fourth upgrader in the Orinoco Belt, Sinovensa, was also halted this week and later restarted, according to the Reuters sources, but at a reduced rate of just 72,000 bpd.Crude oil upgraders are facilities where extra heavy oil of the type that is produced in Venezuela's Orinoco Belt is mixed with lighter hydrocarbons to make it liquid and easier to transport.The upgrader problem is the latest in a string of events that suggest Venezuela's production, which already has fallen to some 700,000 bpd, will likely fall further, especially if prices stay at current levels.The country is in the grips of a major gasoline shortage as refineries are unable to operate at run rates higher than 10 percent because of a shortage of diluents necessary for the production of fuels as well as an urgent need for repairs.What's more, the only two U.S. oil companies allowed to continue doing business in the Latin American nation were last month ordered by Washington to pack up and get out, which puts a question mark over the future of the Petropiar joint venture and means more oil production declines.Amid all this, President Maduro once again reshuffled the government, appointing the former Minister of Industries and National Production Tareck El Aissami as the new oil minister.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

Petrobras has been selling non-core assets and minority stakes in oilfields in Brazil and elsewhere, aiming to cut its massive debt. But the coronavirus pandemic and the oil price crash that followed have upended Petrobras's plans to proceed with a sale of a minority stake in the Marlim cluster of four oilfields, according to Reuters sources.\"With oil at its current levels, it doesn't make sense to discuss such an interesting asset,\" one source with direct knowledge of the situation told Reuters. The idea of selling a stake in the Marlim fields is not dead, it's just uncertain when it will be revived, the source said, adding that it would depend on when oil prices move substantially higher.Last summer, Petrobras launched the binding phase of the sale of offshore upstream oil and gas assets in the Espirito Santo Basin. Before that, in April 2019, Petrobras had approved the sale of several refineries as part of its divestment plan. In July, it struck a deal with the Brazilian antitrust regulator that will allow it to sell those downstream assets in a bid, the company said, to encourage greater competition in the industry. In early July, Petrobras announced the start of the non-binding phase for the sale of its total equity interest in 14 onshore exploration and production concessions in Bahia state, jointly designated as the Reconcavo Cluster.In a presentation in December 2019, Petrobras said it would look to sell additional oil assets, including stakes in Marlim, parts of the Papa-Terra field, its Bolivian assets, petrochem firm Braskem SA, and its remaining stake in BR Distribuidora. The parts of the Marlim field could fetch as much as $4 billion, while Braskem SA could net as much as $3 billion, Petrobras executives said at the end of last year.

        "content": "The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the vulnerability of global supply chains, including those of critical minerals essential for a number of clean energy technologies, while the world needs reliable supplies of lithium, cobalt, nickel, copper, platinum, and rare earths, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said in an analysis this week.  The pandemic and the unprecedented lockdowns in many countries around the world have led to significant declines in the mining activities of critical minerals. Copper mining in Peru--accounting for 12 percent of global copper production--ground to a halt in the lockdown, while platinum production in South Africa was also disrupted. The lockdown in South Africa disrupted much as 75 percent of global platinum production, the IEA said.\"Although prices for many important minerals have fallen as global demand has slumped, recent developments have highlighted a number of reasons why the world should not take secure supplies for granted,\" the Paris-based agency said.The COVID-19 pandemic \"has underscored the need to monitor the security of minerals supply for a clean energy future,\" the IEA noted.Demand for critical minerals is expected to boom in the coming years due to the increase of clean energy technologies and solutions, according to the agency.  Earlier this month, the IEA said in an analysis that batteries and hydrogen-producing electrolyzers are two of the most important technologies as the world moves to a clean energy future.\"And support for battery and electrolyser manufacturing is also a strategic opportunity for governments to ensure that their industries come out of the Covid-19 crisis stronger than before, ready to supply future domestic and international growth markets and able to anticipate potential bottlenecks in technologies,\" the IEA said. \"Lithium-ion batteries & hydrogen electrolysers are ready for the BIG time. They have many things in common & are well suited to mass manufacturing. Putting them in recovery plans can push their costs down & make them cornerstones of modern energy systems,\" the IEA's Executive Director Fatih Birol said on Sunday.

        "content": "Iran's key oil-producing region and home to the country's ports on the Persian Gulf is seeing an alarming increase in COVID-19 infections, medical officials said on Thursday. Iran's total infections also began to rise again after the Islamic Republic relaxed lockdowns.  The Khuzestan province in southwestern Iran bordering Iraq and lying on the Persian Gulf is home to most of Iran's oil and gas fields - the chief foreign income for the Islamic Republic which is being severely crippled by the U.S. sanctions on its oil exports. Khuzestan also hosts the country's ports and the land routes to them, through which most of Iran's exports and imports pass.The COVID-19 pandemic is now spreading at an alarming rate in the province, Radio Farda reports, citing Ali Ehsanpoor, spokesman of Jondishapoor Medical University of Ahwaz in the province.Between Wednesday and Thursday, a total of 178 new cases were identified in the province, bringing the total number of coronavirus cases in Khuzestan - which has a population of 4.7 million people - close to 4,000, Ehsanpoor said.As of Thursday, there were 483 patients with COVID-19 in hospitals in the province and the number of cases continues to increase, he said.Related: Is It The Right Time To Buy Into The Oil Price Rally?Iran was one of the first heavily affected countries by the coronavirus pandemic and the country worst hit in the Middle East. Authorities have relaxed lockdowns, but new cases began to rise again this week.Iran has eased lockdowns for businesses as its economy was already tanking even before the pandemic because of the U.S. sanctions on its oil industry and exports.In contrast to previously defiant statements that Iran will withstand any sanctions of its 'enemies', Iranian President Hassan Rouhani admitted in November that it was very difficult to run the country with severely crippled oil revenues.Now the coronavirus, the crash in global oil demand, and the collapse in oil prices have further hit the Islamic Republic and its key income source, oil revenues.

        "content": "Apache Corp became the latest oil major to report a negative net result for the first quarter, booking a loss of $4.5 billion, or $11.86 per share for the period.Like its peers, Apache also slashed its capital expenditure by 55 percent compared with 2019 to some $1.1 billion and cut its dividend by 90 percent. The company said it would use the cash saved from dividends to strengthen its financial position.Apache has reduced the number of its drilling rigs in the Permian from 21 at the start of the year to just one and plans to halt all drilling and fracking operations after it completes one last well for the year. The approach is likely to become more widespread in the shale patch, where oil prices have hit producers particularly hard. Last month, Apache said it had managed to cut annualized costs by more than $300 million, compared with an earlier target of $150 million in cost savings. This year alone, the company said, it will save some $225 million.\"We have made substantial progress on our organizational redesign initiative, which began in the fall of 2019. This is enabling more flexible resource allocation and increased collaboration while delivering cost savings that are critical in the current environment,\" chief executive John Christmann said at the time.Apache is one of the biggest players in the Permian, with average daily production of 96,919 barrels over the first quarter. This was down from 103,275 bpd at the end of 2019. Its international output--in Egypt and the North Sea--also declined during the first quarter, with the total, including U.S. and international production, down by more than 7,000 bpd during the reporting period.As production shrinks, however, Apache last month announced a second significant oil discovery in a block that it explores in partnership with French Total in Suriname.

        "content": "A Colombian national under U.S. sanctions for his ties to Nicolas Maduro is helping the regime in Venezuela with a gold-for-oil products scheme with Iran, Bloomberg reported on Friday, citing seven sources with knowledge of the matter.  According to some of the sources, Alex Nain Saab Moran - sanctioned by the U.S. for orchestrating a corruption network in Venezuela from which Maduro's regime has profited - has recently traveled to Iran's capital Tehran with executives of Venezuela's state oil firm PDVSA as part of a deal in which Iran is sending gasoline additives and parts for refineries in exchange for gold from Venezuela.A Miami-based lawyer for Saab, Maria Dominguez, denied any participation of her client in any such events in a message to Bloomberg. Last July, the U.S. Treasury sanctioned Alex Saab over a corruption scheme that has enabled Maduro and his regime to profit from food imports and distribution in Venezuela, at the expense of starving Venezuelan people in the horrific economic crisis.\"Alex Saab engaged with Maduro insiders to run a wide scale corruption network they callously used to exploit Venezuela's starving population. Treasury is targeting those behind Maduro's sophisticated corruption schemes, as well as the global network of shell companies that profit from the former regime's military-controlled food distribution program,\" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in July.Last week, U.S. Special Representative for Venezuela Elliott Abrams said that Maduro's regime in Venezuela is paying Iran in gold for help with Venezuela's crumbling oil industry. \"Those planes that are coming in from Iran that are bringing things for the oil industry are returning with the payments for those things: gold,\" Abrams said in conversation at the Hudson Institute, a conservative Washington think tank. In April alone, Venezuela loaded 9 tons of gold, worth around US$500 million, on airplanes for Iran, in exchange for Iranian help for repairing Venezuela's crumbling refineries, sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg last week.

        "title": "UAE Making Even Bigger Cuts To Oil Production Next Month",
        "content": "The United Arab Emirates will cut even more oil production in June, UAE Minister of Energy and Industry Suhail bin Mohammed Faraj Faris Al Mazrouei announced this week.The production cuts, according to Al Mazrouei, will increase by another 100,000 bpd next month, after already reducing its oi production \"in line with the OPEC+ agreement\" in May. This comes after the OPEC member increased its production to more than 4 million bpd in April, when Saudi Arabia was also busy adding crude oil into the global supply glut at a time when the world was shutting down in response to the coronavirus, crippling the demand for crude.Today's news comes as Saudi Arabia, too, said it would cut beyond its promised cuts next month. Saudi Arabia has pledged as part of the OPEC agreement to cut its production to 8.5 million bpd, but said this week that it would cut to 7.492 million bpd in June, after the Saudi energy ministry ordered Aramco to cut bigger.Oil prices had rallied earlier on Monday on this news that even more oil production would be taken out of the mix next month. But by 2:30pm ET, WTI had slipped 3.31% on the day, with the Brent benchmark slipping nearly 5% back below $30 per barrel.Kuwait also announced that it would cut its oil production even more than the OPEC+ agreement called for, by an additional 80,000 bpd in June.But the move to cut additional barrels by Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE was seen not as a positive move, but as an out-of-options move as Middle East producers find themselves without buyers. Today's announcement of additional cuts could, therefore, spark fear instead of confidence as the market views it as a reflection of the true state of the market.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "As India's fuel demand picks up from April lows, Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), the country's biggest refiner and fuel retailer, is gradually boosting operations across its refineries and aims to raise utilization to 80 percent by the end of May, compared to 45 percent in early April.Indian Oil's refineries currently operate at around 60 percent of their design capacities, while plans are to boost those utilization rates to about 80 percent of capacity by the end of this month, the company said in a statement on Monday.  \"The Corporation's refineries were operating full throttle before the COVID lockdown but had to curtail throughputs and bring operations down to nearly 45% of design capacities by the first week of Apr. '20 in view of product containment issues forced by a steep drop in demand,\" the refiner said, noting that even at low capacity utilization, it was on standby to scale up oil refining throughputs once demand begins to recover.In April, gasoline and diesel demand in the world's third-largest oil importer, India, was estimated to have crashed by around 60 percent annually due to the nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of the coronavirus.India - with a population of 1.3 billion people - went into a nationwide lockdown at the end of March. It has since extended that lockdown to the middle of May.Due to this lockdown and to India's struggles to contain the spread of the coronavirus, fuel demand plummeted in April. Refineries then cut run rates and struggled to store crude and refined products in the dwindling available storage capacity.  Now the increased crude processing throughput at the largest Indian oil refiner suggests that the worst of the demand loss may be over in the world's third-biggest oil importer.With lockdowns eased in some European countries and U.S. states, gasoline demand worldwide has also been crawling up in the past two weeks, fueling hopes that oil demand for road transportation could lead the recovery of global oil demand.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "title": "What Will Follow The Biggest US Rig Count Collapse In History",
        "content": "The Covid-19 pandemic has caused the largest horizontal rig count collapse ever recorded in the US, a Rystad Energy analysis of Baker Hughes data shows. The total horizontal oil rig count fell below 270 rigs last week, a 57% decline from the peak of 624 rigs seen in the middle of March 2020. Horizontal gas drilling was down to 70 rigs last week, which is 54% below the previous peak seen in June 2019.The magnitude of the decline in horizontal oil drilling makes this downturn even more unique, compared to the previous downturn of 2015-2016, where declines all the way from the peak to the trough reached around 53% to 54%.While we have not reached the bottom yet, we have most likely passed the peak pace of decline, both in absolute and percentage terms. After several weeks of observing a decrease of 50-55 rigs per week, the oil rig count was down by only 32 rigs last week. On a two-week basis, a 23.4% fall was recorded last week - certainly moderate in comparison to the peak two-week decline level of 25.6% seen the week before.\"The oil price crisis and the impact of Covid-19 has resulted in the most dramatic collapse of the US Land rig market in history. There are two key trends around basin mix; the share of Permian increased in terms of total horizontal oil drilling from around 62% to about 73%, while the share of gas in total horizontal drilling increased from 12% to 21%. We anticipate that both of these shares will continue to climb in the next few weeks.,\" says Artem Abramov, Rystad Energy's Head of Shale Research.The number of counties with active horizontal oil drilling across the whole country has kept declining. Last week, North Slope in Alaska, Walker Ridge in Louisiana, and Ellis County in Oklahoma saw the departure of their last active rigs. This brought the total number of active counties in the country from 49 to 46, a record-low level in modern history.Meanwhile, the number of active counties has stabilized in the state of Texas at 28 counties, and in the Permian Basin at 18 counties.Total horizontal rig count in the Permian fell below 200 rigs and now exhibits more than 50% decline from the peak in March 2020. The three largest sub-basins, Delaware New Mexico, Delaware Texas and Midland North, are now diverging rapidly from each other in terms of the magnitude of decline. Delaware Texas is rapidly losing its rigs having fallen from the peak of 118 rigs to 44 rigs, due to both structural declines and the reallocation of some rigs to sweet spots in New Mexico.Midland-focused operators with Delaware exposure have always prioritized activity outside Delaware acreage. Drilling in Delaware New Mexico stabilized last week, although additional declines might still be observed in the next few weeks. The relative resiliency of Delaware New Mexico can be largely explained by the lack of drilling activity declines realized by ExxonMobil and Devon Energy, which together account for around 50% of the active rigs now in the sub-basin.The Midland North Basin is seeing more significant declines than Delaware New Mexico, though these declines are really driven by the eastern portion of the basin, which hosts Howard and Glasscock counties. Midland County, for example, exhibits only 44% decline from the peak, which is comparable to Lea County in New Mexico.Outside of the Permian, declines persist in Eagle Ford, Bakken and SCOOP & STACK. The total horizontal rig count in these three basins combined is down to 59 rigs which is around a 66% decline from the peak activity level seen in early 2020. Horizontal drilling has been relatively flat in DJ and PRB basins in recent weeks, following a period of material downward adjustment.Gas-focused drilling has kept declining gradually, although Haynesville is now exhibiting some signs of stabilization. Total horizontal gas drilling in Appalachia, which includes Marcellus and Utica, is already down to 35 rigs. The rig count could fall below 30 by the end of 2Q20 before stabilizing in the second half of the year.By Rystad EnergyMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

Saudi Arabia, OPEC's top producer and the world's top oil exporter, is preparing to borrow dozens of billions of US dollars this year to plug the widening budget gap due to the oil price crash.Last week, the Saudi Finance Minister had already warned that the government was preparing to implement \"painful\" measures for propping up the oil-dependent economy.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Aramco is considering staggering payments for the 70 percent in chemicals conglomerate Sabic that it said it would acquire last year.Bloomberg reports that the options the oil major was mulling over involved delaying payments for the majority stake in Sabic as well as reducing the initial installment to the seller, Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund.Aramco signed the deal to buy 70 percent in Sabic from the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia in March 2019, for the equivalent of US$69.1 billion in Saudi riyals at the time. The acquisition was part of Aramco's preparation for going public, which happened, after much anticipation, at the end of last year.Meanwhile, an exclusive Reuters report said that Aramco was also looking to review the price of the Sabic acquisition. The chemicals major's market value, according to the report, which cited unnamed sources, had fallen by 40 percent since the start of the latest oil price rout, with the price Aramco paid for the 40-percent stake high above the current trading price of Sabic.The Reuters report also notes Aramco has also suffered the fallout of the oil price crisis. The company is supposed to pay some $75 billion in dividends to its majority owner, the Saudi government, but its free cash flow is less than that, hence the need to review the Sabic deal. The sovereign wealth fund, meanwhile, was looking to extend the maturity of a $10-billion loan that it took with ten banks last year to boost the availability of short-term funding for new investments. The loan was to be repaid after the completion of the Sabic deal.Separately, the Saudi government is turning to bond markets amid persistently low oil prices that have pressured oil revenues. Last month, Riyadh issued its second bond since the start of the year, at $7 billion, after a much more modest first one, at $2.5 billion.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

What's worse is that the increase in new cases comes after a national decline in new cases that prompted a relaxation of some lockdown measures. The country has recorded a total of 107,603 cases, with 6,640 deaths as of Monday.Earlier this month, media reported, citing medical officials, that the number of new infections was rising across Iran's oil heartland, Khuzestan province, of which the Abadan County is part.The Khuzestan province in southwestern Iran bordering Iraq and lying on the Persian Gulf is home to most of Iran's oil and gas fields - the chief foreign income for the Islamic Republic, which is being severely crippled by the U.S. sanctions on its oil exports. Khuzestan also hosts the country's ports and the land routes to them, through which most of Iran's exports and imports pass.Despite the pandemic, however, Iran is still building a major new pipeline that would transport oil and oil products from Khuzestan to the coast on the Gulf of Oman. The Guriyeh-Jask pipeline will have a capacity of at least a million barrels of crude or petrochemicals. As Simon Watkins wrote earlier this month for Oilprice.com, the pipeline would allow Iran to boost its oil exports significantly while retaining the ability to disrupt oil flows through the Strait of Hormuz.The oil price crash has been a particularly cruel blow to Iran, which was already suffering the effects of U.S. sanctions and a fast rise in Covid-19 infections. Yet, to keep up morale, President Hassan Rouhani has downplayed the effect of low oil prices on the Iranian economy.While he acknowledged the price crash \"has created problems for all of us, even for us,\" The New York Times quoted Rouhani as saying in April, the president added, \"Because our dependency on oil was reduced -- by choice or not, willingly or enforced by the enemy -- definitely our losses will be less.\"By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "title": "The One Factor That Will Determine The Size Of India's LNG Boom",
        "content": "India, the fourth-largest importer of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in the world, will boost its imports by one-third over the next three years, but the import growth will depend on the state of the land gas pipeline network development, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said in an analysis on Friday. India, which doesn't import natural gas via pipelines, has been increasingly relying on LNG imports for its fast-growing gas demand while domestic production is steadily declining. India's LNG imports have increased to represent more than half of its natural gas supply last year, up from 31 percent of gas supply back in 2012, according to EIA estimates.   To meet rising LNG demand and imports, India commissioned earlier this year its sixth LNG import terminal and is building another four facilities expected to come online by 2023. Yet, India's LNG import growth will not only depend on the pace of LNG import and regasification terminals construction, but also on the speed at which the country will be building gas pipelines to carry the gas from its coasts to the landlocked areas of demand, the EIA said. \"The construction of domestic pipelines to move LNG from the coastal import facilities to major demand centers further inland has experienced delays. Future growth in India's LNG imports will depend on the timely completion of natural gas pipeline networks,\" according to the EIA. During the current lockdown, India's LNG importers were said to have declared force majeure on imports. According to a Wood Mackenzie analysis this week, India will see a V-shaped recovery in LNG imports from the middle of June, despite the fact that industrial demand has significantly slowed down during the lockdown. Before the lockdown, India's \"increased spot purchases were a rare glimmer of hope in the increasingly oversupplied LNG market,\" WoodMac said.

        "content": "The Railroad Commission of Texas and oil producers' associations are warning oil firms in the state that people have been visiting oil sites claiming, falsely, to be inspectors of the Railroad Commission, the oil regulatory body in Texas.   \"Nefarious activity in the oil patch is on the rise, including an increase in oil and equipment theft,\" Ed Lonanecker, president of the Texas Independent Producers & Royalty Owners Association (TIPRO), told Houston Chronicle's Sergio Chapa.TIPRO, the Railroad Commission, and the Texas Oil & Gas Association have all issued warnings to oil firms to beware of people claiming to be inspectors--a felony under Texas law which carries a jail sentence of six months to two years plus a fine of US$10,000.According to TIPRO, there was at least one case in which a person falsely claiming to be an inspector told an oil firm in the Permian to immediately halt operations until further notice.\"We aren't speculating about who is impersonating an inspector but this is illegal activity and we wanted to make sure our members were aware,\" TXOGA Communications manager Haley Emerson told Houston Chronicle.Earlier this week, the Railroad Commission of Texas voted against the idea of pro-rationing production in Texas, after Ryan Sitton, the Commissioner who first floated the idea failed to convince his two co-commissioners of the need for mandatory cuts.On Tuesday, Commission chairman Wayne Christian voted against the pro-ration, as he had said he would do. Christian presented a motion to dismiss Pioneer and Parsley Energy's verified complaint to determine reasonable market demand for oil in the State of Texas. The motion passed 2-1.\"This motion ensures Texas companies, rather than the government, can decide for themselves what level of production cuts make sense for them to make while they weather the storm of market instability,\" Christian said.Todd Staples, president of the Texas Oil & Gas Association, welcomed the decision, saying: \"We are pleased that the Railroad Commission will not be pursuing proration because that approach would have made matters worse.\"  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "The federal government moved to block a Washington state law that sought to reduce the amount of volatile gases in crude oil that traveled across its territory in oil trains.The Associated Press reports the Department of Transportation had established that federal law preempts the state law.\"A state cannot use safety as a pretext for inhibiting market growth or instituting a de facto ban on crude oil by rail within its borders,\" said in the ruling Paul Roberti, chief counsel of the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration at the department.The department looked into the Washington law after the attorneys general of North Dakota and Montana petitioned it, arguing the Washington law was effectively a ban on the crude oil produced in the two states.Montana's Attorney General said the state of Washington had tried to \"dictate what commodities other states can transport to market.\"Federal officials judged that the removal of more volatile gasses would not have a significant effect on the severity of oil train crashes, which negates Washington state's safety argument in support of the controversial legislation.The AP notes North Dakota alone shipped some 300,000 bpd of oil by train before the crisis depressed production.\"Washington's law helps protect the public from the inherent risks of transporting oil by rail by decreasing explosion risk in the event of an oil train derailment,\" commented the communications director for Washington Governor Jay Inslee. \"Public health remains our top priority and we are considering our options.\"One could argue that the however many volatile gasses you extract from crude oil, it will remain combustible. Therefore, the only way to prevent oil train crashes is to stop oil trains from moving.Meanwhile, traders are turning to rail cars as storage space for temporarily unsellable oil, Reuters reported in April, adding these to another unusual storage option: pipelines.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "title": "Nigerian LNG Has Nowhere To Go As European Demand Crashes",
        "content": "One of Europe's key liquefied natural gas (LNG) suppliers, Nigeria, has seen demand for its cargoes in Europe crater in the coronavirus pandemic as buyers defer deliveries.Now, Nigeria's LNG is idling on tankers that serve as floating storage, analysts tell Bloomberg.Over the past two months, Nigeria continued to send LNG cargoes to one of its main markets, Europe, but with many major European economies in lockdown, demand has plunged, and customers with options to defer have been postponing the offloading of the cargoes. This has created a fleet of tankers carrying LNG that are now just floating storage, according to commodity tracking firm Kpler, cited by Bloomberg. LNG prices at their lowest in years have forced traders to keep LNG on the tankers, waiting for demand to improve. But prices are not set to improve in the summer, according to Manas Satapathy, managing director for energy at Accenture. \"The worst is yet to come, we will likely see super low prices in late June, July, August,\" Satapathy told Bloomberg. The crash in LNG demand in Europe during the pandemic and the high storage levels will likely mean that the continent will struggle to act as a sponge to absorb excess LNG supply this year as it did in 2019, Rystad Energy said in an analysis last week. Last year, Europe became the \"de facto global LNG sink,\" when milder winter in Northeast Asia slowed down LNG demand growth there, the energy research firm said. In 2019, Europe's total LNG imports surged by 80 percent compared to 2018, while in January and February 2020 - before the European lockdowns and when the coronavirus hit Asia - Europe's LNG imports jumped 35 percent, thanks to the UK, Spain, and Belgium. \"We still don't have an end date for when Europe will completely re-emerge from lockdown, and the impact will probably be deeper coming into the summer months. With gas storage tanks already almost filled to the brim, Europe's capacity to import and actually use the same amount of LNG as in 2019 seems like a tall order, especially if we see another mild winter,\" Rystad Energy said.

        "title": "Asian LNG Prices Spike 20% As Demand Returns",
        "content": "The spot price of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in Asia has surged by more than 20 percent in one week after demand in key importers China and South Korea picked up, while buyers have also canceled U.S. LNG cargoes, traders told Reuters on Wednesday.  The spot price at which several LNG cargoes have been traded have ranged between $2.40 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) and $2.65/MMBtu this week, up from just $2/MMBtu last week, according to several traders who spoke to Reuters.Demand started to snap back in Asia on relaxed lockdowns and a return to business activity. At the same time, buyers in Asia as well as Europe were said to have canceled in April some 20 cargoes from U.S. LNG projects.This week, the uptick in demand and the lower supply have sent LNG prices jumping.  LNG spot prices in Asia began to crawl up last week as countries in the region eased lockdowns, which created some demand. Before that, LNG spot prices in Asia had fallen for three weeks in a row amid sluggish demand in the COVID-19 pandemic and an excess of spot supply.In April, while demand for LNG was still very low, China was said to have taken advantage of the ultra-low prices, stocking up on cheap LNG.Even before the pandemic, natural gas prices - from Asia's spot LNG prices to the price in northwest Europe's hubs and the U.S. benchmark Henry Hub - were falling because natural gas and LNG supply globally exceeded the growth in demand. LNG spot prices had hit a decade low due to warmer winter weather in many parts of Asia, booming new LNG supply--especially from the U.S. and Australia--and slower import growth in China.Then came a milder winter in North Asia and high LNG inventories across Asia in the winter season. All these factors sent LNG prices to multi-year lows. And then came the pandemic that further cratered the LNG market as business activity stalled during lockdowns.

        "content": "ENN Energy Holdings, one of China's largest natural gas distributors, is not ruling out the possibility that natural gas prices could follow last month's WTI Crude move and flip to negative because of insufficient storage.  \"For natural gas, I have heard about the possibility of negative prices. I also think it could happen,\" Wang Yusuo, chairman at ENN Energy Holdings, said at the company's online shareholders' meeting on Wednesday, as carried by Bloomberg.  \"That's because natural gas has even more limited storage capacity and its production is also more rigid. So it may happen. But I don't think it will be a dominant or long-lasting scenario,\" Wang added.  The manager, however, did not specify which natural gas benchmark in which region could turn negative.Such a move in natural gas prices would not be something totally unheard of, especially after last month's plunge of the WTI Crude front-month oil futures contract a day before its expiry.A negative price for natural gas in some regions would not be a first.In the spring of last year, natural gas prices at the Waha hub in West Texas plummeted to record low negative levels, as pipeline constraints and problems at compressor stations at one pipeline stranded gas produced in the most prolific U.S. shale oil basin.As far as the Henry Hub U.S. natural gas benchmark prices are concerned, the EIA expects in its May Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO), the spot price at Henry Hub to remain low compared with historical levels in the near term, due to lower business activity and higher-than-average storage levels.In Q3 2020, lower natural gas production and higher industrial and heating demand are set to lift Henry Hub prices.The EIA expects the Henry Hub spot prices will rise from an average of $2.14 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) this year to an average of $2.89/MMBtu in 2021.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

At least three Asian oil customers who buy oil from Iraq were told not to expect the full volumes next month, according to Bloomberg's sources.It is a rare occurrence for OPEC's biggest cheater in the previous OPEC+ pacts to reduce supply to its key market, Asia, and inform clients of reduced allocations even before Saudi Aramco, which is late with its allocations for June this month.The reduction in Iraq's exports could be a sign that even OPEC's least compliant member is trying to play its part this time, as oil prices are so low that they are devastating Iraq's primary budget income, oil revenues.While Iraq is cutting allocations for June, it was still struggling to come up with a plan about which oilfields should cut production, even after the OPEC+ agreement had already entered into force. As of last week, Iraq hadn't informed its key oil customers about how much crude the country would export because of protracted talks with international oil companies, which have been further complicated by Iraq's inability to form a new government, industry and trade sources told Reuters last week. As part of the OPEC+ deal, Iraq needs to cut around 1 million barrels per day (bpd) of its production, which stood at 4.585 million bpd in March 2020, as per OPEC's secondary sources in its latest Monthly Oil Market Report (MOMR).But Iraq has yet to agree how the cuts should be divided among the many major Iraqi oilfields, most of which are operated by international majors, including ExxonMobil, BP, Eni, and Lukoil, a spokesman for the Iraqi state-owned Basra Oil Company (BOC) told Reuters.

        "content": "Tesla's factory in Fremont, California, reopened this week in violation of a shutdown order issued by the health authorities of Alameda County, but it didn't stop Elon Musk from considering a move to another more business-friendly state like Texas.The California county authorities confirmed that the Tesla plant had been reopened, adding that they had notified the company it could only maintain minimum operations until the county reviewed and approved its safety plan.As for arrests, which Tesla's chief executive Elon Musk acknowledged as a possibility and said he should be the only one to get arrested, none were made.\"I will be on the line with everyone else. If anyone is arrested, I ask that it only be me,\" Musk tweeted yesterday. The Tesla CEO also said, in response to a question about whether the state of California had approved the reopening of the factory, that \"Yes, California approved, but an unelected county official illegally overrode. Also, all other auto companies in US are approved to resume. Only Tesla has been singled out. This is super messed up!\"Musk's fight with the Alameda County health authorities escalated earlier this week, when he threatened to pull the company out of California and relocate production to Nevada or Texas. As usual, he took to Twitter to launch his attack.\"Tesla is filing a lawsuit against Alameda County immediately. The unelected & ignorant \"Interim Health Officer\" of Alameda is acting contrary to the Governor, the President, our Constitutional freedoms & just plain common sense!\" Musk tweeted on Saturday, just as Tesla said in a blog post that it would reopen the Fremont factory in accordance with strict rules for safety.\"Frankly, this is the final straw,\" Musk continued on Twitter. \"Tesla will now move its HQ and future programs to Texas/Nevada immediately. If we even retain Fremont manufacturing activity at all, it will be dependent on how Tesla is treated in the future. Tesla is the last carmaker left in CA.\"It was no idle threat, either. Tesla filed a suit against Alameda County this week, Business Insider reported, citing the suit as alleging the county order ignored an earlier order issued by Governor Newsom, which allowed business in 16 industries, including transportation, to resume operation.Musk's advances toward Texas did not go unnoticed. A Hidalgo County judge sent a letter to Elon Musk, wooing him to move Tesla's California plant to his county, valleycentral.com reported.\"I have recently read of your displeasure with authorities in California and your desire to relocate to Texas 'immediately' ... You, of course, are well familiar with South Texas given the presence of the SpeceX launch site at nearby Boca Chica Beach. What you may not be familiar with is the Rio Grande Valley's and Hidalgo County's existing relationship with automobile manufacturing and the value it may bring to Tesla Motors,\" the letter read in part, adding that there is no longer a shelter at home mandate.

        "content": "The American Petroleum Institute (API) estimated on Tuesday another large crude oil inventory build, of 7.58 million barrels for the week ending May 8 even as several U.S. states begin the slow process of reopening certain segments of their battered economies.Today's inventory build was expected to be just 4.147 million barrels--less than half of the weekly inventory builds we've seen over the past few weeks, according to API data. The figures were, however, nearly double those expectations.In the previous week, the API estimated a large build in crude oil inventories of 8.440 million barrels, while the EIA's estimates were for a significantly smaller build of 4.6 million barrels for that week.Oil prices were trading up on Tuesday afternoon prior to the API's data release, as news of additional OPEC production cuts reinvigorated markets skittish about oversupply at a time when demand continues to lag.  The United States, for its part, is seeing its own drop supply, from 13.1 million bpd at its height to 11.9 million bpd for May 1, according to the Energy Information Administration.At 3:39 pm EDT on Tuesday the WTI benchmark was trading up on the day by $1.71 (+7.08%) at $25.85--$.15 down from this time last week. The price of a Brent barrel was also trading up on Tuesday, by $0.32 (+1.08%), at $29.95--down roughly $0.50 per barrel week on week.The API reported a draw of 1.911 million barrels of gasoline for week ending May 8--less than last week's 2.237-million-barrel draw. This week's draw compares to analyst expectations for a more optimistic 2.216-million-barrel draw for the week.Distillate inventories were up by 4.712 million barrels for the week, compared to last week's 6.143-barrel build, while Cushing inventories saw a draw of 2.26 million barrels.At 4:43 pm EDT, WTI was trading at $25.85 while Brent was trading at $29.95.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Russia's largest oil producer, Rosneft, will slash its investments for 2020 by 21 percent from earlier plans, due to the dramatic situation on the oil market and the new OPEC+ deal in force since May 1, Rosneft's chief executive Igor Sechin told Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday.Considering the dramatic state of the global oil market and the decision to cut oil production, Rosneft will have to optimize its capital expenditures, Sechin told Putin, the Kremlin said today.  Rosneft will try to keep its investment program for this year at around US$10.2 billion (750 billion Russian rubles), down from US$12.9 billion (950 billion rubles) in capex planned earlier, Sechin said.Rosneft's boss also asked Putin to look into ways to make obtaining credit easier, to help producers, contractors, and suppliers.Sechin also asked if the government could defer oil exploration-related taxes to a future period, in order to help oil companies to go through the current crisis, and recalibrate oil transportation tariffs to the current price of oil. Currently, transportation costs account for 32 percent of Rosneft's final cost of oil, Sechin said.Oil executives in Russia, including Sechin, have often criticized the OPEC+ pact, which began its efforts to fix the market and prop up prices in January 2017. Russian firms have argued that the OPEC+ cuts only serve to prop up U.S. shale production with higher oil prices, giving America more share on the global market at the expense of Russia and its OPEC allies in the OPEC+ deal. Many analysts saw Moscow's refusal in early March to back a collective 1.5-million-bpd cut from all OPEC+ members as the end of the Russian patience for propping up U.S. shale. As part of the latest OPEC+ pact, Russia will have to cut its oil production from around 11 million bpd to 8.5 million bpd in May and June--and many analyst expect Russia would not be able to fully comply with its share of the cuts, again.

        "content": "Norway is set to use a record amount of petroleum revenues from its US$1-trillion oil fund - the world's largest sovereign wealth fund - this year to counter the economic slump from the COVID-19 pandemic and low oil prices.The government of Western Europe's largest oil producer, whose wealth fund has amassed more than US$1 trillion from petroleum revenues over the decades - proposed on Tuesday a revised budget for 2020, which calls for using US$41 billion (419.6 billion Norwegian crowns) from the fund. This sum would account for 4.2 percent of the estimated value of the fund at the beginning of this year.    Norway has rarely used more than 3 percent of the Government Pension Fund Global, as Norway's oil fund is officially known.\"'Increased spending has been a necessity in the current situation - both to avoid an even sharper downturn and to help healthy companies through the crisis so they can create jobs and growth when normal circumstances return,\" Finance Minister Jan Tore Sanner said in a statement.Norway's economy has been hit by the social distancing measures like every other country around the world, while the oil and gas sector - a major contributor to the economy - is also suffering from the low oil prices after oil demand crashed in the pandemic.Last week, Norway slashed its key policy rate to 0 percent in a surprise move, citing the oil price crash and the sharp drop in economic activity as a result of the pandemic.   \"The downturn is amplified by the severe impact of the pandemic on surrounding countries and by a sharp fall in oil prices. Lower oil prices have contributed to weakening the krone exchange rate,\" Norges Bank said in a statement, after delivering what analysts described a 'surprise' cut by 25 basis points to zero.   In a bid to support global efforts to prop up oil prices and ease the glut, Norway has decided it would cut its crude oil production by 250,000 bpd in June, and then maintain a 134,000-bpd lower rate of production for the rest of 2020. This is the first time Norway has joined oil production cuts since 2002. Then, Norway reduced its production rate by 150,000 bpd over the first half of the year, after oil fell below $20 a barrel following the 9/11 terrorist attacks.

This declaration would allow drillers to keep their leases.According to the Commission, no vote has yet been taken.Crude oil leases typically require the holder to perform certain activities, such as drilling a set number of wells over a given period, or risk losing the right to the land.In addition to declaring some production waste, oil producers proposed to the Oklahoma Corporation Commission to mandate output cuts. The commission has not decided on that proposal, either.Due to a last-minute amended application by the Oklahoma Energy Producers Alliance, or OEPA, the parties in the case will now have until May 18th to file comment on the changed application.Interestingly enough, the regulator last month already adopted an emergency order, under which drillers could declare some oil economic waste and shut in wells to curb their losses. In fact, one commissioner dissented officially against the emergency order, arguing it was \"replete with fatal errors.\"There are opponents to the proposals among oil companies as well. According to Crawley Petroleum Corp, the order that allows companies to declare some production economic waste could lead to lawsuits, Reuters reports.\"The notion that we don't have the right to do this (shut wells) absent of this order is a fallacy,\" the company's chief executive Kim Hatfield said.The situation within the industry is the same as it is in Texas and other oil states; while some producers insist that the state authorities act to support the industry, others are against any regulatory interference.Also, like in Texas, the regulators seem wary of ordering production curtailment, not least because drilling in Oklahoma is already down substantially. According to the American Petroleum Institute and the Petroleum Alliance of Oklahoma, drilling is down by as much as 90 percent from pre-crisis levels.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

The European firms include commodity trading and distribution company Elemento Ltd, and Geneva-based Swiss Oil Trading and Supply SA--a physical crude oil trading company.The FBI is gathering data for a US Treasury Department inquiry, to see which, if any, of the abovementioned companies violated the U.S. sanctions that seek oust the Nicolas Maduro regime.Neither the US Department of Justice nor the Treasury Department confirmed that the companies were being investigated, Reuters said.Venezuela and its troubled oil industry have been operating poorly under U.S. sanctions,  which the United States has exercised its right to pursue before, most notably against a Rosneft subsidiary who was trading in Venezuelan crude oil in violation of U.S. sanctions. That subsidiary had been propping up Maduro in the absence of other willing Venezuela crude oil traders, according to the United States.Now, Venezuela must find other outlets for its crude oil.Both Abordo and Schlager told Reuters that they have contracts with Venezuela to swap food and water trucks for crude oil--a transaction that they say steers them clear of any U.S. sanctions violations.PDVSA export documents seen by Reuters shows Abordo and Schlager now serve the largest middlemen for Venezuelan crude oil.Venezuela's oil production fell to just 622,000 bpd in April 2020, according to OPEC's latest Monthly Oil Market Report, less than half of the 1.354 million bpd Venezuela produced in 2018.

        "content": "The drastic spending cuts across the U.S. shale patch due to the low oil prices will likely lead to a 6.1-percentage point slump in total U.S. business fixed investments in the second quarter, Dallas Fed economists said in a new analysis this week.  Over the past decade, oil and gas sector investments have grown as a share of total U.S. nonresidential business fixed investments, thanks to the shale boom. In the 2010s, U.S. oil firms spent a total of $1.2 trillion on drilling and completing wells, boosting U.S. crude oil production by almost 140 percent in the past decade. The share of the oil and gas industry's investment of U.S. nonresidential business fixed investment - an important component of the country's GDP - averaged 6.4 percent, double for the share in the previous decade, the Dallas Fed noted.Even before the oil price collapse in early March, some U.S. oil firms had started to reduce planned investments for 2020 by 10-20 percent, abandoning the 'production growth at all costs' strategy as investors demanded returns and profits.But after prices collapsed to multi-year lows with the crash in demand from the pandemic along with the Saudi oil price war, the U.S. shale patch was very quick to pull back investment and drilling activity. Due to the oil price crash, the global glut, and lack of storage, U.S. oil firms are announcing production curtailments by the day.Related: How Accurate Are EIA And API Inventory Reports?The Dallas Fed expects industry capital expenditures (capex) to plunge by about 35 percent during the second quarter of 2020--a drop steeper than the declines in first-quarter 2016 and during the oil bust of 1986.The 35-percent crash in investments in the energy sector is set to be a significant drag on total U.S. business fixed investment this quarter, with U.S. fixed investment expected to drop by 6.1 percent.The outlook on the U.S. production is uncertain, according to Dallas Fed economists.\"While U.S. oil production growth was already on the verge of leveling off due in part to the steep output-decline rate of existing wells, the drilling slowdown makes it likely that U.S. output will struggle to reach its previous highs in coming years,\" they said.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

Earlier this year, the United States slapped sanctions on Rosneft's Swiss-based trading arm as part of its attempts to cut off all revenue streams to Nicolas Maduro's government in Caracas. The U.S. has signaled that it is ready to tighten even more the noose around the Venezuelan government. Commenting on Rosneft's Q1 performance, chief executive officer Igor Sechin said on Friday:\"In second quarter of 2020, the Company closed a previously announced transaction to transfer to a company that is 100 % owned by the Government of the Russian Federation all assets in Venezuela, including participation shares in projects of Petromonagas, Petroperija, Boqueron, Petromiranda and Petrovictoria, as well as oilfield service companies and trading operations.\" Rosneft's operations in Venezuela \"have been completely discontinued,\" Sechin said. Meanwhile, Russia's top oil producer reported a net loss of US$2 billion for the first quarter of 2020, due to the low oil prices and the depreciation of the Russian ruble. The Q1 loss compares to a net profit of US$1.9 billion for the first quarter of 2019.Liquids production fell by 2.2 percent year on year to 4.64 million bpd in Q1 2020, \"due to continued compliance with OPEC+ Agreement constraints,\" Rosneft said.

        "content": "Chinese refineries increased their run rates by 11 percent last month as the country began to emerge from the months-long lockdown prompted by the coronavirus outbreak that became a pandemic.At 13.1 million bpd, the April run rates were also higher than the average for the same month in 2019, although by less than 1 percent, Reuters reported.The news indicates a marked improvement in oil demand, at least from refineries in the world's top oil importer. Even the four-month average for January to April was not much lower than the year-earlier period: that average was about 12.28 million bpd, according to Reuters calculations, down by 3.4 percent from the average for January to April 2019. Given the massive change in oil demand from a year ago, the reduction in run rates was indeed modest.To compare, in February, at the height of the outbreak in China, refinery run rates fell to the lowest in six years, at some 10 million bpd. At the same time, refiners took advantage of the oil price rout to stock up on cheap oil while the rout lasted. Now, refinery runs are expected to continue to rise as industrial activity in China recovers to normal levels. Capacity utilization rates at independent refiners rose to 73 percent last month, according to data cited by Reuters, which was a record high. Meanwhile, at state refiners, utilization rates have increased to an average of 79 percent this month.Refiners in China could use a pickup in oil demand for sure. Last year teapots added 900,000 bpd in new refining capacity, raising concerns about excess in that department. Total refining capacity on the world's largest oil importer stood at 17.2 million bpd as of the end of 2019, and if refiners stick to their plans, it should continue rising.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "While much of the United States--including Texas--is taking steps to reopen the economy, oil and gas jobs are still on a downward spiral, with oil and gas jobs in Texas this week seeing another 1,000 oil and gas jobs vanish, the Houston Chronicle reported on Thursday, amid the effects of the coronavirus that has stripped demand out of the market.ProPetro Services--a Midland-based oilfield services company, laid off nearly 400 people, the Houston Chronicle said, citing a company filing with the Texas Workforce Commission.Tenaris, an oilfield pipe manufacturer just south of Houston, cut 200 employees this week.The oil and gas industry in Texas had already shed over 30,000 jobs as of a few weeks ago, according to BW Research.CEO of Texas economic research firm Perryman Group estimated that Texas could end up shedding nearly 100,000 oil and gas jobs. But the true toll could be much higher, when you factor in all the retail and hospitality businesses that will be affected by the contraction of the oil industry. All told, Perryman forecast that Texas could see 1 million jobs lost.Overall, the U.S. oil and gas industry lost 51,000 drilling and refining jobs in March alone.While the situation for oil country still looks dire, the price of WTI perked up on Thursday afternoon, rising nearly 10% to $27.74 per barrel as IEA suggested that the outlook for Fall 2020 oil demand wasn't as grim as it was before as lockdowns begin to ease.

        "content": "U.S. import prices declined in April by the biggest monthly drop in more than five years, as fuel import prices slumped by the most since records began in 1992, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Thursday.  U.S. import prices fell by 2.6 percent in April, after a 2.4-percent drop in March, with both monthly declines led by falling fuel prices, the BLS said.In March and April, crude oil prices slumped by 60 percent from their recent highs in January after the previous OPEC+ pact fell apart in early March and Saudi Arabia waged an oil price war for market share by discounting deeply its oil for April. The global oil demand loss due to the lockdowns and travel restrictions in the coronavirus pandemic further depressed international benchmark prices as demand crashed by around 30 percent in April.Prices for imported fuel plunged by 31.5 percent in April, after a 26.0-percent decline in March, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed.The April decline was the largest one-month drop since the U.S. Import and Export Price Indexes were first published monthly in September 1992, the BLS said. The drop in import fuel prices was mostly driven by a 33.0-percent drop in the price index for import petroleum, while natural gas prices also declined in April, by 3.3 percent.  On a yearly basis, prices for import fuel fell by 56.6 percent from April 2019 to April 2020 - this was the biggest 12-month drop since the yearly index was first published in December 1984, according to BLS data.Over the past year, petroleum prices slumped by 58.5 percent, more than offsetting the 5.9-percent increase in natural gas prices. Excluding fuel, prices for all other U.S. imports inched down by 0.5 percent in April compared to March. For exports, prices for non-agricultural industrial supplies and materials fell by 10 percent in April compared to March, led by a 28.2-percent drop in fuel prices.

        "title": "IEA: Oil Market Recovery Faces Two Major Uncertainties",
        "content": "Even after the 'Black April' ended and demand started to crawl up, the oil market and supply-demand balances continue to face two major uncertainties on its fragile road to recovery--a possible second wave of COVID-19 infections and potentially underwhelming OPEC+ compliance with the cuts, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Thursday.   In its Oil Market Report for May, the IEA noted that despite pledges both for deeper cuts and over-compliance from OPEC's Middle East heavyweights Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Kuwait, it is highly uncertain how compliant the whole OPEC+ group would remain with the production reductions. One of the biggest questions that the oil market faces is whether the OPEC+ participants could achieve and then keep the cuts, the IEA said.  An even bigger headache for the oil market rebalancing and oil price recovery is the major uncertainty if coronavirus infections will start rising again in a second wave, after economies have started to re-open and lockdowns are being eased, including in some of the worst hit countries in Europe such as Italy and the United Kingdom.\"These are big questions - and the answers we get in the coming weeks will have major consequences for the oil market,\" the Paris-based agency said.These uncertainties, if realized, could put at risk the IEA's slightly more optimistic view on the global oil market this month compared to last month. In the May report, the IEA expects global oil demand to drop by 8.6 million bpd in 2020--a major demand loss this year, but slightly less than the 9.3-million-bpd demand destruction the agency had predicted in its report in April. For Q2 2020 alone, the IEA expects demand to plunge by 19.9 million bpd compared to last year's consumption levels.\"A resurgence of Covid-19 is a major risk factor for demand,\" the IEA warned.

        "title": "Oilfield Services Stocks Lose Half Their Value In 2020",
        "content": "It is widely acknowledged that the oilfield services sector (OFS) is the energy world's worst-hit market from the Covid-19 pandemic. What is staggering is the extent that the capitalization of listed OFS companies has fallen. A Rystad Energy analysis reveals that stocks in OFS companies have collectively lost half their value since the beginning of 2020.Analyzing a representative group of 116 listed OFS companies, accounting for around 71% of the traded equities in the sector in 2019, Rystad Energy found that the firms have lost approximately 49% of their market capitalization since the beginning of this year.The best performers among service companies were in the Engineering, Procurement, Construction and Installation (EPCI) sector, which only saw market capitalization drop by 27% compared to the value erosion of between 39% and 54% for most other service segments. The most affected stocks were in offshore drilling, a segment that has nosedived by about 80% since the beginning of this year.\"In a nutshell, our analysis indicates that companies with exposure to EPCI, facility leasing, maintenance and inspection services, SURF or subsea equipment have been less punished by investors, who have prioritized limiting their exposure to well services, drillers, acquisition contract seismic and the North American market,\" says Rystad Energy senior energy service analyst Binny Bagga.Another general trend is that share prices of companies that have consistently paid dividends/distributions over the past years have dropped less than non-dividend-paying companies.Related: Oil Prices Jump On Surprise Crude Inventory DrawOne explanation for the EPCI performance is that a significant proportion of EPCI company revenues stems from industries outside of the oil and gas sector. Another respite for the EPCI segment is that the average contract cycle time is longer than for most other segments, which means that these companies are more likely to be busy with existing projects even if new sanctioning activity is low.The second-best-performing service segment consists of companies with multi-segment operations, and three elements stand out in particular here. First, this segment index is positively impacted by large-cap companies, especially those with significant exposure to EPCI, facility leasing, inspection and maintenance services. Most of the better-performing names also have diversified geographical exposure.Secondly, the index performance, in general, is negatively impacted by companies dependent on North American well services. Lastly, about half of the companies in this service segment index have consistently paid dividends over the past three years. Most of these companies have been rewarded with a better share price performance or less market value erosion compared to non-dividend-paying companies.As for the subsea service segment, investors seem to be more favorably inclined toward companies with a larger exposure to SURF and subsea equipment than to companies only exposed to subsea services. This is to a great extent driven by longer contract durations for the former group.Related: Has Demand For Oil Already Peaked?When it comes to maintenance and operations, the segment's performance is adversely impacted by offshore vessel companies, whose shares have dropped more than companies in facility leasing and other maintenance and operations. The companies within this segment already had excess capacity overhang challenges when this downturn began, and are now exploring every possible strategy to survive.In the seismic and G&G service segment index, around three-quarters of the companies have seen their market cap erode by more than 60% this year. This segment is highly vulnerable to exploration cost cuts by E&P operators, and to complicate matters further the segment's average contract recycle duration is around two years. The plight of well services companies with strong exposure to the North American (NAM) region is well known in the market. More than half of the companies in our NAM well services index have had market cap erosion of more than 60% this year, with some players slumping more than 80%. Overall this segment is plagued by little service differentiation, which is expected to have a profound impact on pricing and utilization as E&P operators continue to slash their budgets.The story is much the same for onshore drillers, as share performances and investor appetite for North American-leveraged land drillers have quickly taken a turn for the worse. Our analysis indicates that international exposure is proving beneficial, especially to the Middle East, which is expected to be more resilient than North and South American markets.Many offshore drillers, the worst-performing service segment, are in the process of exploring financial restructuring options, while some of the others have engaged in share repurchase options to shore up stock prices.Finally, looking at company size, our analysis indicates that large-caps have outperformed the small-cap and micro-cap shares in the OFS market. Furthermore, the share performance gap between large-caps and other categories has widened in recent weeks.\"The result of this crisis will likely be more financial restructuring and consolidation to right-size the capital base across the service segments. Additionally, we will see more companies canceling dividend payments and resorting to poison pills and reverse stock splits as the time goes by,\" Bagga concludes.By Rystad EnergyMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

The total job loss so far constitutes as much as 17 percent of total employment in the industry, BW Research said.Last month, a group of organizations, including BW Research Partnership, warned that more than half a million jobs could be lost in the renewable energy industry because of the crisis. At the time, one of the organizations, E2, said the number of jobs lost in March was equal to the number of new jobs added in the industry last year.And the pain is not over either, BW Research Partnership warned in its report, with the number of job losses continuing to increase this month and beyond.\"Our previous projection of a half million or 15 percent of all clean energy jobs lost by the end of June has already been surpassed,\" BW Research Partnership said. \"Based on that analysis, along with forecasts from clean energy trade groups and reports from individual companies, we conservatively project that the clean energy sector will lose about a quarter of its workforce or 850,000 jobs by the end of the second quarter if no actions are taken to support the clean energy industry and its workers.\"According to another survey, from the Solar Energy Industries Association, the solar power industry alone could shed half of its 250,000 jobs over the next few months unless urgent relief measures are put into action.Back in April, E2 called on Congress to help the industry get through the crisis with as little losses as possible by extending tax incentive application deadlines and by providing temporary refundability for renewable tax credits \"that are increasingly difficult to monetize.\"By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

The cargo should help alleviate a growing shortage of gasoline in the sanctions-stricken South American country.The Clavel, a medium tanker, loaded in March at the Iranian port of Bandar Abbas, and this week passed the Suez Canal, the data showed.TankerTrackers.com co-founder Samir Madani confirmed the data to Oilprice.com, noting that there were several vessels en route from Iran to Venezuela, with the cargo all or mostly gasoline.Venezuela is in the grips of a major gasoline shortage as refineries are unable to operate at run rates higher than 10 percent because of a shortage of diluents necessary for the production of fuels as well as an urgent need for repairs.Iran, a fellow target of U.S. sanctions, last month sent to Venezuela two plane loads of equipment and chemicals necessary for the production of gasoline as it agreed to help Caracas restart one refinery, with a capacity of 310,000 bpd. At the time, sources told the AP that 14 more flights were scheduled to arrive from Iran to Venezuela, some of them carrying refinery technicians.Venezuela, according to a Bloomberg report, was paying Iran for its help with the refinery in gold, with nine tons of the precious metal already transferred to Iran. The Iranian Ambassador to Venezuela dismissed the report as a \"baseless rumor\".Whatever financial exchange is taking place, Venezuela is in dire need of help with its refineries. The problems with its gasoline supply began to emerge earlier this year as the United States continued to tighten the sanction noose around Caracas' neck. At one point, a group of private companies even called on the government to allow gasoline imports to ease the pain caused by the state of the country's refinery network and the suspension of gasoline imports from the U.S.According to local legislation, the Venezuelan state is the only party that can sell gasoline on the local market.By Irina Slav from Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

At the end of 2019, Kurdistan and the federal government of Iraq had agreed that KRG would transfer oil revenues and 250,000 bpd to the federal government.But the federal government has said that Kurdistan has failed to send oil or cash Baghdad's way.The federal government of Iraq pays nearly half of the sum necessary to cover KRG administration employees.Kurdistan, for its part, was severely hit by the oil demand and oil price collapse in March and April and is struggling with payments.\"The Kurdistan Region is going through difficult economic times due to falling oil prices and the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, and must make adjustments due to limited financial resources,\" Prime Minister Masrour Barzani said at a KRG cabinet meeting this week.After weeks of negotiations and a meeting between KRG representatives and officials from Iraq's federal government on Wednesday, the spokesman for Kurdistan's Regional Government, Jutiar Adel, said, as carried by Middle East Monitor:\"Within the framework of the agreement concluded in 2019, we are willing to deliver 250,000 barrels of oil per day to the federal government. We are also committed to transferring the financial revenues generated from oil sales to the Iraqi state treasury.\"Meanwhile, Kurdistan said last month that it would defer payments to oil companies operating in the region for the oil sales they had made between November 2019 and February 2020, as Iraq and the Kurdistan region are struggling to meet their obligations after the oil price crash.

It that point, the value of FSD is probably somewhere in excess of $100,000,\" Musk also said in the tweet.Roadshow reports the current price for the full self-driving package is about $7,000, adding that Tesla last raised the price of models with that package last August. At the time, the price increase was again $1,000.Even earlier, in July 2019, Musk said, in a string of tweets, that Teslas could become not a little, but a lot more expensive once they were equipped with complete self-driving capabilities.\"All HW2+ cars are upgradable to full self-driving capability with Tesla FSD computer & all production in past few months has FSD computer,\" Musk said at the time. \"HW2\" refers to the Tesla system that enables full self-driving functionality in the cars. \"Production fully switched over ~3 months ago. Functionality won't diverge until Q4, as it's limited by software validation. Will be later for Europe compared to rest of world due to regulatory constraints that were put in place years ago by big ICE companies.\"For clarification, the so-called FSD system does not turn a Tesla into an autonomous vehicle. The system works in tandem with the infamous Autopilot system that has been blamed by drivers for several crashes involving Teslas over the last few years. Currently, the FSD system allows for automatic lane changing, parking assistance, a summon feature, and automatic control of traffic light and stop signals. The next feature to be added to the system is automatic steering.According to Musk, the Autopilot system will be advanced enough to drive alone from one location to another by the end of this year.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

It will be a record monthly loss.The largest drop on the list for crude oil and condensate production is in the Permian, which is expected to fall by 87,000 bpd to 4.290 million bpd. The next largest basin, the Eagle Ford, is expected to fall by 36,000 bpd in June, to 1.174 million bpd.There are losses expected in all seven basins on the EIA's list.Gas production is expected to see across-the-board losses, too, with the EIA predicting a loss of 779 million cubic feet per day. For gas production, the EIA is expecting that Anadarko will see the largest drop of 244 million cubic feet per day to 6,486 million. The next largest loss in June will come from the Permian, with a loss of 210 million cubic feet per day.  The anticipated losses in production both this month and next are not surprising, although they are significant. Oil producers across the globe have cut production both as a market strategy and as a natural consequence of the low oil prices and shrinking storage capacity for crude oil.Oil prices ticked up on Monday on positive developments on a possible coronavirus vaccine, as China's demand for crude is looking up, and as the EIA predicted even greater production losses next month after the United States has already seen its crude production fall by more than 1 million barrels per day.WTI was trading up 11.59% on the day at 4:30 pm EDT, at $32.84.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

U.S. refiner Citgo is the crown jewel in the holdings of Venezuela's state oil firm PDVSA, but the rejection of the Supreme Court to hear Venezuela's arguments for appeal of the previous ruling could mean that Venezuela is now even closer to losing control over Citgo than before, according to Bloomberg.Citgo Petroleum Corp is one of the largest oil refineries in the United States. Its current operations are managed by two dueling boards of directors--one appointed by Nicolas Maduro and one appointed by Juan Guaido--the opposition leader recognized as the legitimate president by the U.S. and 50 other countries - and both are digging in over the power struggle for Venezuela's U.S.-based refinery that rakes in US$30 billion in revenue. In the summer of 2019, a U.S. federal appeals court rejected PDVSA's appeal to knock down an earlier court order that allowed Crystallex to take over Citgo shares in compensation for US$1.4 billion for the expropriation of assets in Venezuela.Venezuela has long argued that Citgo should be immune from the billions in debt that Venezuela has accrued on the grounds that they are two separate entities, but U.S. courts disagree, ruling that PDVSA and Citgo's U.S.-based parent company PDV Holding did not show adequate separation from the Venezuelan government, which has accrued billions in debt with multiple parties.The Republic of Venezuela had appealed at the U.S. Supreme Court the Third Circuit court's decision from last year to allow Crystallex to claim its compensation, saying that the seizing of Citgo shares would be a conflict under federal sovereign immunity law.Still, Crystallex would need a U.S. sanctions waiver to execute its claim, an adviser for Juan Guaido told Reuters last year after the court allowed it to proceed with claiming its compensation award.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Iran has warned the United States not to interfere with any Iranian fuel shipments to Venezuela in Caribbean waters, Iran's foreign ministry said on Sunday, following reports that the U.S. could consider measures in response to those shipments.Last week, a senior U.S. Administration official told Reuters that the United States was looking into measures that it could take in response to shipments of fuel from the Islamic Republic to the regime of Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela.Crisis-hit Venezuela is now reeling from severe U.S. sanctions on its oil industry, years of lack of investments in maintaining its dilapidated refineries, the coronavirus pandemic, and low oil prices. Fuel shortages in the South American country sitting on top of the world's largest oil reserves are more acute than before.Iran and Venezuela, both under strict U.S. sanctions, have reportedly boosted their cooperation in recent months. Last month, U.S. Special Representative for Venezuela Elliott Abrams said that Maduro's regime in Venezuela is paying Iran in gold for help with Venezuela's crumbling oil industry. According to tanker-tracking data provided to Reuters by Refinitiv Eikon, at least one tanker has loaded fuel at an Iranian port and is currently traveling to Venezuela.\"Following the release of reports suggesting U.S. officials had threatened to harass Iranian tankers carrying fuel to Venezuela, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, in a letter to U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres, warned the United States about sending troops to the Caribbean Sea with the aim of interfering with the transfer of Iran's fuel to Venezuela,\" Iran's foreign ministry said on Sunday.In addition, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister for Political Affairs, Seyyed Abbas Araqchi, summoned the ambassador of Switzerland, which represents the U.S. interests in Iran, and \"asked the top diplomat to relay to Washington officials Iran's serious warning over any possible threat by the U.S. against Iranian tankers,\" Iran said.\"Zarif stressed that the U.S. must give up bullying on the world stage and respect the rule of international law, especially free shipping in the high seas,\" Iran's foreign ministry said.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "title": "Total Backs Out Of Buying Occidental Assets",
        "content": "Total will no longer pursue the acquisition of Occidental's assets in Ghana, the French supermajor said on Monday, after a snag in the sale of assets in Algeria as part of the Occidental-Anadarko deal last year.When Occidental Petroleum completed one of the largest oil mergers and acquisitions (M&A) of the past few years, buying Anadarko Petroleum and assuming its debt in a transaction valued at a total of US$55 billion, Occidental had signed a binding agreement to sell Anadarko's assets in Algeria, Ghana, Mozambique, and South Africa to Total for US$8.8 billion.Since the completion of the Occidental-Anadarko deal, on which the African asset sales were contingent, Occidental and Total have completed the deals under which Total bought Anadarko's assets in Mozambique and South Africa.But the sale in Algeria has fallen through, Total said today.\"Occidental has informed Total that, as part of an understanding with the Algerian authorities on the transfer of Anadarko's interests to Occidental, Occidental would not be in a position to sell its interests in Algeria,\" the French supermajor said in a statement.Since the sale of the Ghana assets was contingent on the completion of the sale of the Algerian assets, Total is now discontinuing plans to acquire Anadarko's assets in Ghana.\"This decision not to pursue the completion of the purchase of the Ghana assets consolidates the Group's efforts in the control of its net investments this year and provides financial flexibility to face the uncertainties and opportunities linked to the current environment,\" Patrick Pouyanne, Total's chairman and chief executive officer, said.  The collapsed deal for the Algerian assets means preserving cash for Total in times of high uncertainty. But it is another blow to Occidental, which was relying on the sales of Anadarko's African assets to receive a total of US$8.8 billion that could partially reduce the huge debt it had accumulated to buy Anadarko in what analysts now see as an ill-timed decision to pursue such a huge and leveraged transaction.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Oman has decided to liquidate a solar power company it funded together with Shell because of the persistent depression in oil prices, Reuters reports, citing Omani media.The decision to liquidate GlassPoint Solar was taken last week, ending the ambition of Petroleum Development Oman and Shell to replace natural gas in enhanced oil recovery with solar power to produce steam that would then get injected into oil wells.The company was in charge of the Miraah project in Oman: a 1.021 GW solar farm built at the Amal field in southern Oman. The project was estimated to have a cost of $600 million. The funding for GlassPoint Solar came in at $30 million from Petroleum Development Oman, Shell, and a group of private equity firms.\"We regret that GlassPoint Solar Inc has gone into liquidation at a time of considerable global business distress and uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic,\" Petroleum Development Oman said in a statement. The company had a 31-percent stake in GlassPoint Solar.Oman is among the oil producers most vulnerable to oil price shocks, the International Monetary Fund said in February this year in an analysis on the resilience of Gulf state economies. That analysis, which focused on the long-term outlook of the region, predated the start of the global pandemic, which has certainly aggravated matters for those already vulnerable to low oil prices.Moody's also sees Oman as one of the most vulnerable oil producers in terms of credit profiles. Fitch Ratings also placed Oman among the oil producers, \"where weaker balance sheets and policy buffers will limit governments' capacity to respond to the oil price slump without putting pressure on their ratings.\"Oman's break-even price - the oil price required to balance the government budget, all else being equal - is $82 a barrel Brent crude, according to Fitch Ratings.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "title": "UK Oil Tanker Attacked By Pirates Off Yemen Coast",
        "content": "Pirates launched an attack on a UK-flagged chemical tanker this weekend in the Gulf of Aden, off the Yemeni coast. The guards on the vessel managed to repulse the attack without any injuries and only minor damage to the tanker, the AP reported, quoting a statement from Stolt Tankers, the owner of the vessel.According to the company, the tanker, Stolt Apal, was about 75 nautical miles off the coast of Yemen when six armed men in two skiffs approached it. The guards and the attackers exchange fire and the guards of the Stolt Apal managed to disable one of the pirates' skiffs, which effectively ended the attack.The AP notes this was the ninth pirate attack in the Gulf of Aden since the start of the year. Data from the World Economic Forum shows a 24-percent increase in overall piracy so far this year, compared with the same period of last year. The WEF warned the coronavirus pandemic could worsen the situation further because \"Poorer governments are less able to battle piracy as the coronavirus pandemic weakens economies.\"The Gulf of Aden contains one of the world's biggest oil chokepoints, Bab el-Mandeb. Some 3.8 million bpd passed through it as of 2016. This made it the fourth-largest channel for oil in the world, after the Strait of Hormuz, which sees 17 million bpd pass through it, the Strait of Malacca between Indonesia and Malaysia, which sees daily traffic of 15.2 million bpd, and the Suez Canal, with daily traffic of some 4.6 million bpd as of 2016.Since it passes between war-torn Yemen on the one side, and Eritrea, Djibouti, and Somalia on the other, shipments of crude oil via Bab el-Mandeb are under constant threat from pirates and other militant groups operating in the area.For a long time the Gulf of Aden was considered the most dangerous of the oil chokepoints because of piracy but this year, another Gulf took the crown: the Gulf of Guinea. In the first quarter of this year, the oil production hub on the Western African coast was home to 21 of the total 47 pirate attacks for the world.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "After a month of tensions in Malaysia's exclusive economic zone in the South China Sea, a Chinese survey vessel has left Malaysian waters, Reuters reported on Friday, quoting data from Marine Traffic.In the middle of April, tensions flared up again in the disputed South China Sea, after Chinese research and survey vessel Haiyang Dizhi 8 started tagging an exploration ship, West Capella, which Malaysia's state oil firm Petronas had hired for exploration in the area.  The long-running dispute in the South China Sea involves territorial claims by China as well as Vietnam, the Philippines, Taiwan, Brunei, and Malaysia. China has territorial claims to about 90 percent of the South China Sea, which has put it at odds with its neighbors.The Haiyang Dizhi 8 ship has been close to the West Capella exploration vessel operated by Petronas. The same Chinese ship had been spotted off Vietnam's waters before that, and was moving closer to Malaysia in mid-April, according to ship-tracking data cited by Reuters at the time.Today, the Chinese vessel left Malaysia's exclusive economic zone en route to China, flanked by at least two other Chinese ships, according to data from Marine Traffic cited by Reuters.  Earlier this week, the Malaysian oil exploration ship West Capella left the disputed area on Tuesday, security sources and the vessel's operator told Reuters. Offshore drilling firm Seadrill, via its communications director Iain Cracknell, confirmed to Reuters that the West Capella vessel contracted by Petronas had left the area after completing its exploration surveys.Tensions in the South China Sea have increased in recent weeks. Last month, the U.S. State Department said, commenting on reports that China had sunk a Vietnamese fishing vessel in the South China Sea:\"We call on the PRC to remain focused on supporting international efforts to combat the global pandemic, and to stop exploiting the distraction or vulnerability of other states to expand its unlawful claims in the South China Sea.\" By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "title": "PetroChina's Biggest Refinery To Restart In June",
        "content": "PetroChina's biggest refinery, a 410,000-bpd facility in Dalian, will resume operations in late June after a two-month overhaul, Reuters reports, citing a statement by the oil company.This could mean an increase in Chinese oil imports from Russia because the Dalian facility is connected to the East Siberia-Pacific Ocean pipeline, and is the biggest processor of the ESPO blend, Reuters notes.The restart of the Dalian refinery will add to rising run rates in the world's top oil importer, which would likely be taken as good news for demand, no matter where the supply comes from.There are already reports that Chinese refiners are ramping up their processing rates. In April, these rose by 11 percent from March as the country began to emerge from the months-long lockdown, reaching 13.1 million bpd. Also, the four-month average run rates for January to April were only moderately down on the year, suggesting that the industry did not suffer too severe a blow from the lockdown.Now, refinery runs are expected to continue to rise as industrial activity in China recovers to normal levels. Capacity utilization rates at independent refiners rose to 73 percent last month, which was a record high. Meanwhile, at state refiners, utilization rates have increased to an average of 79 percent this month.This means that fuel output will increase as well, in a market already quite well supplied with fuels, Reuters' Clyde Russell wrote in a recent column. In April, Russell noted, Chinese fuel exports hit a record of 8 million tons, up 10.2 percent on the month and almost 30 percent on the year.This would mean lower profit margins for an industry already struggling with these because the increase in fuel exports has been consistent for over a year. At the same time, processing capacity has been increasing, too. Last year alone, independent refiners in China added 900,000 bpd in new refinery capacity, and more is on the way over the next couple of years. Unless demand across Asia and beyond improves markedly, the refining industry in China may find itself in more trouble in tune with the ramp-up in fuel production and exports.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "The U.S. Administration is holding this week an oil and gas lease sale in New Mexico while American producers curtail production in response to low oil prices and environmentalists and indigenous groups protest lease sales and drilling plans.The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has scheduled the oil and gas lease sale in New Mexico for the week starting May 18, and the online auction is set to begin on May 20 and end on May 21. BLM proposes to offer 95 parcels totaling 45,446 acres in Chaves, Eddy, and Lea counties in New Mexico; and Wise County in Texas.The oil and gas lease sale in the state home to the westernmost part of the Permian basin will be the first auction for drilling on federal land since U.S. benchmark prices flipped negative in April a day before the expiry of the May futures contract of WTI Crude.While BLM says that the lease sale is keeping with the Administration's goal of promoting American energy security, environmentalists and other groups have protested against the sale, saying that public comments on the auction have been hampered by the COVID-19 outbreak.WildEarth Guardians also said earlier this month that BLM and the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) denied requests to suspend the public comment period on a controversial drilling plan for the Greater Chaco region.\"Ignoring these requests, the Bureau of Land Management is refusing to relent on the Trump's Administration's \"energy dominance agenda,\" despite record low oil prices questioning whether oil and gas drilling is now revenue negative for communities and New Mexico at-large,\" WildEarth Guardians said.In March, after oil prices crashed, the U.S. Administration held oil and gas lease sales in four states, despite calls for immediate suspension of oil and gas drilling lease sales on federal land amid slumping prices.

With these avenues exhausted, oil and gas companies have become increasingly reliant on artificial intelligence and computing power, which allow them to eke out additional gains from their processes through real-time big data, algorithms to analyze seismic data, deep machine learning, and fuzzy logic, to name a few.Especially after the coronavirus pandemic stripped away a huge chunk of demand and oil prices fell recently even into negative territory, these AI and computing services have become even more critical to the industry.Meanwhile, big data, AI, 5G and the IoT--whether or not they are employed by oil and gas companies--could be responsible for 20% of the world's electricity consumption and 5.5% of the world's CO2 emissions by 2025 based on findings from a peer-reviewed study by Swedish researcher Anders Andrae, as people scramble to stay connected through smart phones and the internet.

        "content": "The renewable energy industry will see a decline in growth this year but will recover and start growing again next year, the International Energy Agency has said in a new report.This year would be the first in two decades when new solar and wind power capacity additions will see a dip, the IEA said, noting that so far, the industry has demonstrated strong resilience to the consequences of the pandemic.Even so, many projects will be delayed, leading to 13 percent fewer solar and wind power capacity additions this year, compared with 2019. In 2021, however, total new renewable energy additions will recover to 2019 levels, not least because of two large-scale hydropower projects set to come online in 2021. This means that solar and wind will see slower growth for new additions than previously expected by the authority, and by as much as 10 percent.However, this should not be cause for worry as previous forecasts were invariably upbeat, leaning on continued government support for renewable energy. None of the forecasts could anticipate the coronavirus pandemic and the extent of its impact on the world.\"The resilience of renewable electricity to the impacts of the Covid-19 crisis is good news but cannot be taken for granted,\" the head of IEA, Fatih Bitol, said. \"Countries are continuing to build new wind turbines and solar plants, but at a much slower pace. Even before the Covid-19 pandemic struck, the world needed to significantly accelerate the deployment of renewables to have a chance of meeting its energy and climate goals. Amid today's extraordinary health and economic challenges, governments must not lose sight of the essential task of stepping up clean energy transitions to enable us to emerge from the crisis on a secure and sustainable path,\" he added.Meanwhile, another report has warned that solar and wind power companies face another challenge: declining revenues.

        "content": "At least three tankers loaded with Canadian crude have headed to China since the start of the year, Bloomberg reports, citing shipping data. This is the latest sign of how the oil crisis is changing demand patterns.The usual buyers of Canadian crude are U.S. refineries, but demand has been depressed in the United States. In China, however, it appears to be improving, benefiting the long-suffering Canadian oil industry. Oil sands producers had to shut in about 1 million bpd in oil production amid the latest price crisis, and the survival of some is questionable.The federal government has had to step in with financial support, linking it, however, with climate change commitments. Even with these, the industry and the Alberta government welcomed the aid, which will be made available both for small and large oil companies.\"We know that the [financial] need could be great. We've seen some recovery in energy prices, that's very welcome, but these prices that we're seeing today are by no means close to profitable for the industry,\" Alberta finance minister Travis Troews said, as quoted by Global News.Canadian oil firms have been reducing spending and output at many heavy oil projects in Alberta, due to the unsustainably low oil prices and the demand crash in the COVID-19 pandemic. The cuts have worked: earlier this month, the local benchmark, Western Canadian Select, narrowed its discount to West Texas Intermediate to less than $4 a barrel, the smallest gap in 12 years. News about increased storage--by no less than 2 million barrels--also contributed to WCS's improved performance relative to WTI.Meanwhile, refineries in China are raising run rates as the country comes out of lockdown, and imports are on the rise once again.

Meanwhile, the EIA's estimates were for wildly different, with the industry body reporting last week that the inventories had fallen by 700,000 barrels.WTI was trading up on Tuesday afternoon prior to the API's data release, but the day had already seen swings from a gain for the day to a loss, then back to a gain as the demand picture looks a bit rosier than has in past weeks on the last day of the June futures contract--a day that last month was plagued with uncertainty and negative oil prices.Oil production in the United States has now fallen from 13.1 million bpd on March 13 to 11.6 million bpd for May 8, according to the Energy Information Administration--a drop of 1.5 million bpd.At 4:00 pm EDT on Tuesday the WTI benchmark was trading up on the day by $0.54 (+1.70%) at $32.36--nearly $7 per barrel up from this time last week.

All vehicles on Spanish roads will also have to be zero-emission by 2040, according to the draft law.The Spanish cabinet hopes that the new legislation, if passed, could mark the course to recovery for the country and its economy after the COVID-19 pandemic, in which Spain is one of the worst affected countries in the world.The new legislation would put Spain on course to fulfill its pledges under the Paris Agreement and play a crucial part in the EU Green Deal.  If the bill becomes law, Spain will join another major European economy, the UK, in enshrining a net-zero pledge into law.In June last year, the UK became the first major economy in the world to enshrine into law its target to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. Under the law, the UK will be required to have net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, compared to a previous target of at least an 80-percent emissions reduction from 1990 levels.Earlier this year, the European Commission proposed enshrining the European Green Deal's commitment for carbon neutrality by 2050 into legislation as part of the European Union's heightened focus on climate action and policy.Under a European Climate Law, the 2050 carbon neutrality target would become legally binding and all EU institutions and member states will be collectively bound to take the necessary measures at the EU and national level to meet that target.

The oil price crash in early March dragged down with it the share prices of all major oil companies in the world, as Saudi Arabia flooded the market with oil while the coronavirus pandemic was battering global oil demand.Over the past week, shares in oil majors have been rising in lockstep with rising oil prices, as signs of demand recovery began to emerge not only from China but also from the United States.Shares in Aramco are now above the levels just before its majority owner, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, waged an all-out price war with Russia to claim more market share. Aramco, which has been trading on a stock market since early December 2019, has a much smaller trading volume each day compared to the major international oil companies.Aramco's average daily traded volume of shares was around $35 million last week and US$100 million on Monday. To compare, shares in ExxonMobil traded on Monday were worth US$1.4 billion, according to Bloomberg estimates.Earlier this month, Saudi Aramco reported a net income of US$16.66 billion for the first quarter of 2020, down from net earnings of US$22.2 billion for Q1 2019, due to the coronavirus pandemic and the oil price crash that Saudi Arabia itself helped to worsen with the oil price war in March.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "title": "U.S. Overtakes China As Most Attractive Destination For Renewables",
        "content": "The United States beat China to become the world's most attractive country for investments in renewable energy, and the prospects for the U.S. renewables sector after the pandemic are bright despite the current setbacks, E.Y. said in a new report on Tuesday.  The latest edition of the Renewable Energy Country Attractiveness Index (RECAI) developed by E.Y. showed the U.S. snatching the top spot away from China for the first time since 2016. The shift in attractiveness in the United States was largely due to the short-term extension to the production tax credit (PTC) for wind power and long-term growth in offshore wind plans, which envisage investments of US$57 billion for the installation of up to 30 gigawatts (G.W.) by 2030, E.Y. said.At the same time, growth in China's renewables market has slowed down because the authorities want to wean the renewables market off subsidies, the consultancy noted. The slashed subsidies and lower demand from the coronavirus pandemic bumped China off its first-place seat, according to E.Y.Apart from the U.S. and China, the top ten most attractive markets for renewables investment include France, Australia, Germany, the UK, India, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Japan.Of these, India slumped from third place in the previous index to 7th place now, as its \"progress in renewables has been labeled as 'disappointing'\", E.Y. said, adding that India could miss its target for 175 GW of renewables installed in 2020.In the United States, the COVID-19 pandemic is currently disrupting the sector, and jobs are being lost like in every other sector in the country. But the prospects for after the pandemic continue to be favorable, E.Y. said in its analysis on the United States.\"While the COVID-19 pandemic presents near-term headwinds to renewables, the longer-term prognosis remains favorable. One powerful driver for the sector is the clean or renewable energy targets set by a growing number of states,\" said Brian Murphy, Partner, Power & Utilities Tax at Ernst & Young.Other major drivers of the U.S. renewables industry will be declining costs of renewables and increased calls for climate awareness and sustainability among ratepayers and corporate buyers, which have encouraged utilities to favor renewables for new capacity, Murphy said.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Just three out of twelve public oil and gas firms in the United States have so far said they had returned loans received under the program to help small businesses keep employees during the COVID-19 pandemic, Reuters reported on Tuesday, citing securities filings.The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) of the U.S. Small Business Administration was intended for small businesses that do not have access to other sources of funding, such as bond or equity markets.The PPP, a loan designed to provide a direct incentive for small businesses to keep their workers on the payroll, will be forgiven by the SBA if all employees are kept on the payroll for eight weeks and the money is used for payroll, rent, mortgage interest, or utilities, the Administration says.But in the initial confusion about guidance on who is and who is not entitled to receive loans under the program, many listed companies have applied for and received such loans, including a dozen smaller but listed U.S. oil and gas firms.Three of those, PDC Energy, Natural Gas Services Group, and Dawson Geophysical have returned millions of U.S. dollars in loans they had received under the PPP loan.Denver-based PDC Energy said in an SEC filing in early May that it had applied for and received a US$10 million loan in April through the PPP.\"Pursuant to recently released guidelines with respect to the CARES Act and the SBAPPP loans, we returned the $10 million of funds,\" the company said.Natural Gas Services Group's chief executive Stephen Taylor said on the earnings call this month that the firm had applied for and received a US$4.6 million loan under PPP. Although the firm still considers it eligible under the program, NGS decided to return the loan. But after returning that loan, NGS was forced to reduce its workforce by 20 percent, or roughly 50 of team members, Taylor said, noting that, \"In effect, public companies in our employees were discriminated against what became a politically driven process.\"Dawson Geophysical of Midland, Texas, said last week it had returned the US$6.37-million loan it had received under PPP \"out of an abundance of caution and in light of the new guidance.\"Other companies have also received loans under PPP, but have not indicated yet whether they intend to return those loans, according to Reuters.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "The Ukrainian port Odessa on the Black Sea will receive its first-ever crude oil cargo of WTI Crude from the United States, after the U.S. shipped its first oil to Ukraine just last year as it looks to wean off Russian oil and gas supplies after Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014.A first cargo of WTI Crude to Odessa is set for arrival at the port on Wednesday, industry sources told Reuters. According to the sources, the tanker UMLMA carries 80,000 tons of WTI Crude to Odessa. Marine Traffic data shows that the UMLMA crude oil tanker traveled from Port Neches in the U.S. and was very close to Odessa, Ukraine, early on Wednesday.This is not the first oil cargo of American crude oil to Ukraine, but it is the first WTI Crude cargo to Odessa, a month after the front-month WTI Crude futures dipped into negative territory a day before the contract expired.Ukraine's first-ever U.S. crude oil cargo was received in July last year, when a tanker carried 80,000 tons of Bakken crude to the port of Odessa.Before today, the last U.S. oil shipment to Odessa was again another Bakken crude cargo in March this year.  Ukraine and some other countries in eastern Europe such as Poland have turned to buying American oil as they want to diminish the energy influence of their large neighbor Russia.The entrance of U.S. oil into Odessa follows another first for US oil. The United States has also just sent the first cargo of U.S. crude oil to Belarus as part of a pledge made earlier this year, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last Friday, while Belarus seeks to diversify its oil imports after a bitter spat with Russia over oil supply and prices this winter.Despite the settling of the dispute, Belarus is still looking to diversify its oil import sources to cut dependence entirely on Russian oil supply. Earlier this month, Belarus welcomed the first cargo of crude oil from Saudi Arabia.Belarus will continue to work with countries from which it had already bought oil, Azerbaijan and Norway, as well as its new partners Saudi Arabia and the U.S., First Deputy Prime Minister, Dmitry Krutoi, told the state news agency of Belarus, BelTA.

        "title": "U.S. Approves $43B Alaska LNG Project Which Still Seeks Investors",
        "content": "The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approved this week the construction and operation of the Alaska LNG project estimated at US$43 billion, which has been years in the planning but still lacks investor commitments for its completion.  FERC authorized on Thursday the Alaska Gasline Development Corporation (AGDC)--an independent, public corporation of the State of Alaska--to liquefy and export liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the North Slope to an export facility in Nikiski, Alaska. The Alaska LNG Project consists of a Gas Treatment Plant on Alaska's North Slope, an 800-mile pipeline, and an LNG facility in Nikiski, Alaska, and is estimated to cost US$43.4 billion.Commenting on FERC's project authorization, Alaska Governor Mike Dunleavy said:\"Today's federal authorization is a key step in determining if Alaska LNG is competitive and economically beneficial for Alaska. I commend the AGDC team for their diligence. The ongoing project economic review and discussions with potential partners will determine the next steps for this project.\"\"Our momentum continues as we complete our assessment of the project's economics and competitiveness, and engage with potential project partners to determine the best path forward for the Alaska LNG Project,\" said AGDC President Frank Richards.The project was first proposed in 2014, but in 2016 the partners in the project, ExxonMobil, BP, ConocoPhillips, and TransCanada, withdrew as potential investors and the state of Alaska took over the project.According to Alex DeMarban of Anchorage Daily News, FERC's authorization of the project could be a key step for a potential sale of the project to investors or buyers.However, considering the current state of the global LNG market with prices at record lows and demand sluggish in the COVID-19 pandemic, investors may not be rushing to pour billions of US dollars to complete the project, all the more so that oil and gas supermajors are tightening their belts after the oil price crash in March.

The delay comes a day after the Bureau of Land Management unexpectedly postponed an oil and gas lease sale that was scheduled for this week without providing an explanation.\"They're just postponed,\" JulieAnn Serrano, Lease Sale Supervisor and Supervisory Land Law Examiner for the Bureau of Land Management's New Mexico State Office told Oilprice.com when asked for a reason for the postponement.What links the two events is the fact that the lease sale, like the drilling plan for the lands around the Chaco Culture National Historical Park, has attracted criticism from environmentalist groups and other stakeholders regarding public comments. In the case of the lease sale, opponents insisted that this be suspended for the duration of the Covid-19 pandemic. In the case of the drilling plan, the criticism focused more on the inability of many Native American communities to take part in remote public comments for lack of technological capabilities.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

Shell also cut spending in March, by $5 billion per year compared to 2019 levels, to $20 billion.Shell may also make more job cuts in the second half of the year, the sources said.Shell said it would \"go through a comprehensive review of the company,\" adding that \"where appropriate, we will redesign our organization to adapt to a different future and emerge stronger,\" Shell told Bloomberg today.The oil price crunch has caused almost all companies to take a look at their financial plans. Already, the oil and gas industry in Texas alone has seen more than 30,000 jobs cut, and that figure is weeks old and will likely grow. Even as the United States begins to emerge from its restrictive lockdowns that has taken a chunk out of oil demand, it is widely expected that this demand will not snap back full force in the coming weeks, and many oil and gas companies--including the national oil companies--are prudently reviewing how their current strategies will fit into this gloomy outlook on oil demand and are making painful changes as necessary.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Alyeska Pipeline, the operator of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS), is allowing increased oil flows through the pipeline system, easing the production curtailments on the North Slope as demand begins to recover.Brigham A. McCown, president of Alyeska Pipeline, tweeted last week that \"With inventory and supply chain distribution improving, Alyeska Pipeline will be removing 2/3rds of previous proration.\"This means that the pipeline system will be able to take up to 95 percent of crude oil shipments from the North Slope, McCown said. After the oil price crash in March, the crashing demand in the pandemic, and the soaring inventories, Alyeska Pipeline had imposed a 15-percent cut to the oil flow from the North Slope crude oil production. Last week, the pipeline operator eased that cut to 5 percent, or around 25,000 barrels per day (bpd) across all fields, Alaska Public Media reported.\"It is a big deal to be able to adjust a proration and get back to business, where every barrel that producers intend to move, we can move,\" Alyeska spokeswoman Michelle Egan told the outlet, adding that there wasn't a timeline yet as to when the operator would remove the last 5-percent oil flow reduction.According to TAPS' weekly roundup of crude oil throughput via the Trans-Alaska system, throughput increased from 434,859 barrels on May 11 to throughput of 450,299 barrels on May 18.Production from the North Slope dropped in April to just over 400,000 bpd from more than 500,000 bpd before the price crash. Despite the eased restrictions on oil flows on the pipeline system, ConocoPhillips will not be reversing its plan to curtail 100,000 bpd of gross production in Alaska in June. At the end of April, ConocoPhillips said that it would curtail 460,000 bpd in North America in June, including 100,000 bpd in Alaska, due to weak prices. \"The decision to curtail production by 100,000 barrels a day in June has been made, and that won't change,\" Natalie Lowman, spokeswoman for Conoco Alaska, said in an email to Alaska Public Media.

        "content": "OPEC member Algeria plans to install up to US$3.6 billion worth of solar photovoltaic (PV) projects to produce renewable electricity for export and for meeting increasing domestic power demand.The solar power facilities are expected to have a combined installed capacity of 4,000 megawatts (MW), the office of Prime Minister Abdelaziz Djerad said in a statement.The OPEC member, which generates most of its electricity from natural gas, plans to have those solar PV plants installed between 2020 and 2024, the prime minister's office said. The project for the new solar power plants, called TAFOUK1, is part of the government's plan to boost power generation from renewable energy sources.The whole project will require investments of between US$3.2 billion and US$3.6 billion, and is expected to create 56,000 jobs during the construction phase and 2,000 jobs during the operational stage, the government said.Apart from meeting growing domestic demand and positioning Algeria to export electricity, the new solar projects will help it preserve its oil and gas resources, the government said.In Algeria, the oil and gas industry is the backbone of the economy, accounting for 20 percent of GDP, and 85 percent of total exports, according to OPEC data.The oil price crash hit Algeria's finances, and earlier this month, the country decided it would slash its budget for this year by 50 percent due to the drastically lower income from oil after the price crash.Algeria - which was already feeling a squeeze on foreign exchange reserves even before oil prices collapsed in early May due to the Saudi-Russian oil price war and the global demand crash in the pandemic - is now taking drastic action to protect its finances this year.Due to the low oil prices, another oil and gas producer in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, Oman, has recently decided to liquidate a solar power company it funded together with Shell because of the persistent depression in oil prices.

Last year, Saudi Aramco was looking to spend billions of U.S. dollars on natural gas acquisitions in the United States as part of this strategy.  Aramco signed in May 2019 an agreement with Sempra Energy to offtake LNG from the Phase 1 of the Port Arthur project, and take a 25-percent stake in the project.\"The agreement with Sempra LNG is a major step forward in Saudi Aramco's long term strategy to become a leading global LNG player. With global demand for LNG expected to grow by around 4% per year, and likely to exceed 500 million metric tons a year by 2035, we see significant opportunities in this market and we will continue to pursue strategic partnerships which enable us to meet rising global demand for LNG,\" Amin Nasser, Saudi Aramco's CEO said back then.However, all bets on the global demand for LNG were off when the COVID-19 pandemic struck. LNG demand this year is expected to be much weaker than expected before the crisis.Sempra Energy, which initially targeted the final investment decision (FID) for Q3 2020, said earlier this month that \"Given current market dynamics, a final investment decision is now expected for the project in 2021.\"Now that the FID has been delayed by at least a couple of quarters, Aramco has put earlier plans to charter up to 12 LNG tankers on hold, according to Reuters' sources.\"The shipping requirement was meant for Port Arthur, so given the delay and also the current market, it makes sense to put the shipping on hold,\" one of those sources told Reuters.

The city has started work on one of its landmarks, the Golden Driller statue, to make it look like Tesla's chief executive, Elon Musk.The statue--a tribute to oil drilling--was built in 1953 and has this inscribed at its base: \"The Golden Driller, a symbol of the International Petroleum Exposition. Dedicated to the men of the petroleum industry who by their vision and daring have created from God's abundance a better life for mankind.\"And that's not all, some are even hopeful Musk will relocate the company's headquarters to Tulsa, a city that is advertising itself as a low cost of living and low-tax rate heaven.The hope that Tesla might choose to relocate came after Elon Musk lashed out at California county authorities that had ordered a suspension of all non-essential business, including carmaking. The order, by the health authorities of Alameda County, infuriated the Tesla CEO, which threatened to relocate the company.\"Tesla is filing a lawsuit against Alameda County immediately. The unelected & ignorant \"Interim Health Officer\" of Alameda is acting contrary to the Governor, the President, our Constitutional freedoms & just plain common sense!\" Musk tweeted on Saturday. This was the same day that Tesla said in a blog post that it would reopen the Fremont factory in accordance with strict rules for safety.\"Frankly, this is the final straw,\" Musk continued on Twitter. \"Tesla will now move its HQ and future programs to Texas/Nevada immediately. If we even retain Fremont manufacturing activity at all, it will be dependent on how Tesla is treated in the future. Tesla is the last carmaker left in CA.\"Separately, the company is looking for a location for its new factory, where it will make the Cybertruck, and Tulsa is on the short list, along with Austin, Texas. Tulsa is hard at work to win Tesla's favor: the city's mayor recently said on Twitter that the Tulsa police would buy Cybertrucks if they are produced there.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "In response to the industry downturn, national oil companies (NOCs) are set to slash their exploration budgets by 26 percent on average this year, Wood Mackenzie said in an analysis on Wednesday.The consultancy analyzed media announcements and tracked well plans of 11 large spenders among NOCs--three Chinese NOCs, Thailand's PTTEP, Malaysia's Petronas, India's ONGC, Qatar Petroleum, Russia's Rosneft and Gazprom, Brazil's Petrobras, and Mexico's Pemex.  Although all of those NOCs are axing exploration budgets in the near term, the measure is likely to be just a short-term move because exploration is an important part of NOCs business for the longer term, much more so than exploration is for the supermajors, WoodMac said.NOCs invested on average 17 percent of their upstream budgets in exploration between 2015 and 2019, while the international oil majors spent an average 8 percent of upstream budgets on exploration in that period, according to Wood Mackenzie senior analyst Huong Tra Ho.Many NOCs will cut spending on upstream exploration abroad, prioritizing domestic exploration and investments amid the industry slump and the global economic downturn in the pandemic, which weigh on oil and gas-rich countries.\"Most NOCs on the list carry strong government mandates. Many NOCs prioritise current revenue and contribution to government budgets at the expense of capital investments for the future. A dollar invested at home remains at home in the form of local employment, local services, taxes and government take,\" Ho said in a statement.In redrawing exploration plans, NOCs with limited discovered domestic resources could try to protect exploration budgets as much as possible. These are Petronas and China's CNOOC, for example. On the other hand, Russia's Rosneft and Gazprom, who have long reserve lives, are not as pressured to protect exploration spending from cuts, Wood Mackenzie said.The exploration budget reductions at NOCs are likely only near-term measures in response to the industry environment, WoodMac said, adding that \"We expect NOCs to revitalise their exploration programmes as the sector recovers.\" By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

The judge in London dismissed the case on the grounds that the UK has no jurisdiction to try the lawsuit that is basically the same for which Shell and Eni are currently under trial in Italy, Bloomberg reported.Eni and Shell are on trial in Milan for allegedly knowing that an alleged payment of US$1.1 billion in bribes was made to the former Nigerian government back in 2011, for which Eni and Shell secured exclusive rights to develop the now infamous oil block OPL-245 offshore Nigeria.  The 2011 acquisition of block OPL 245, according to Italian and Nigerian prosecutors, involved a transfer of money to personal accounts held by the Nigerian oil minister at the time.  The sum of the OPL 245 deal was US$1.3 billion, an investigation revealed, of which US$1.1 billion was used to bribe politicians and businessmen to secure the deal. Shell and Eni have always insisted that at the time, they were unaware of any wrongdoing.Eni and Shell were ordered to stand trial in Milan under the Italian legislation that mandates companies be liable for crimes committed by directors and executives when a suspected unlawful conduct has benefited the legal entity.In January this year, a key witness for the prosecution in the Milan trial backpedaled on previous testimony that he had seen evidence that Eni and Shell were involved in bribery over the oil deal in Nigeria. While the trial in Milan is in its final stages, other lawsuits are pending elsewhere over the same Nigerian oil deal. Shell, for one, faces prosecution from the Dutch authorities over the acquisition of block OPL 245.  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "title": "Why Bitcoin Miners Should Head To Oil Country",
        "content": "In 2017, bitcoin burst into the global consciousness when it soared from below $1,000 to nearly $20,000. It then just as quickly dropped out of the limelight as it crashed to below $4,000 and investors began to doubt claims that it would become the global currency of the future.But while bitcoin may have dropped off the front pages, the cryptocurrency itself and the mining industry behind it are very much alive and kicking. Bitcoin miners, which saw a wave of bankruptcies when prices crash in 2018, are expected to return to profitability this year. The majority of those miners will maximize their profits by building their heat-producing mining computers in a cold climate and close to a cheap source of energy. But one innovative company in West Texas is doing things differently.Layer1, a startup backed by billionaire Peter Theil, set up its operations in one of the hottest states in the country, and now it is making money even when it's computers are turned off. The secret to this company's success has been its ability to turn its mining operations into massive bitcoin batteries that will sell power back to the grid when there are demand shocks. In summer, Texas can see a doubling of its peak electricity use, which puts utilities in the state under massive strain. During these peaks, Layer1 will switch off its mining operations and allow its 100mw load to flow to the grid. In return for this service, the company receives an annual premium equating to roughly $17 million. That reduces Layer1's all-in power price by 75 percent, meaning the company pays just 10 percent of what residential customers would pay for energy. While that may seem like a massive premium to pay as insurance against demand spikes, it remains cheaper for the grid operators than building a new power plant or installing a battery to have on standby. With an annual energy footprint slightly larger than that of Switzerland, bitcoin miners the world over may soon consider acting as a backup to energy grids that face seasonal spikes. Texas, which is both the largest oil-producing state and the largest wind energy-producing state in the United States has plenty of cheap energy for miners to take advantage of. And with its major electricity demand spikes in summer, it seems bitcoin miners may soon have to reconsider where they are setting up shop.By Josh Owens for Safehaven.com More Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "title": "Russia's Energy Minister Sees Oil Market Rebalancing By July",
        "content": "Amid the coronavirus pandemic, oil demand has plummeted over the last few months but Russia's oil minister sees the global supply and demand situation rebalancing within two months, according to RIA sources, cited by Reuters.Russia's Energy Ministry expects oil demand to improve in May, and notes that we are already seeing major shifts to global oil supplies, with production cuts--either purposefully or otherwise--rising to nearly 15 million barrels per day.The global surplus, the energy ministry says, is between 7 million and 12 million barrels per day.Reuters sources have indicated that OPEC+ wants to keep the existing production cuts beyond the current June expiry in order to rebalance the market.Saudi Arabia and Iraq--two of OPEC's largest oil producers, have reaffirmed their commitment to rebalance the oil markets. Saudi Arabia has pledged to cut an additional 1 million bpd on top  of its existing quota. Iraq, however, may find it difficult to achieve its promised targets.The news that the Russian energy ministry sees the market rebalancing by July comes at the same time when Russia is considering banning all oil products imports, in a move designed to protect its oil refining industry at a time of decreased demand.Russia has agreed to cut its oil production to 8.5 million bpd throughout the duration of the OPEC+ cuts. Normally, Russia's adherence to its stated oil production quotas have been subpar, but this time, a lack of demand for crude has spurred the country into swift action.The IEA last week said that it saw signs that the oil market would come into balance quicker than originally thought, after the United States and OPEC brought their production lower--and lower more quickly--than most had anticipated.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "India's fuel demand, which had crashed by 60 percent during the early days of its two-month lockdown, is set to reach pre-coronavirus levels in June, Indian Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan told Times of India over the weekend.  In May, demand for fuel in the world's third-largest oil importer is back at 65 percent compared to May 2020, \"and will reach pre-Corona level in June,\" Pradhan told TOI.After the easing of the lockdown in India, two-wheelers and small cars will remain an affordable option for maintaining social distancing, thus boosting demand for gasoline, according to the minister. Higher vehicle traffic, farm-sector activities, and the resumption of train service and flights will raise demand for diesel and jet fuel, Pradhan told TOI.Last week, Indian oil industry executives told Bloomberg that crude oil demand in India would take longer to recover than many hope for as the country braces for the worst recession in its history after a two-month lockdown.In April, gasoline and diesel demand in India was said to have crashed by around 60 percent year on year.But this month, India's fuel demand has picked up pace from the April lows, and Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), the country's biggest refiner and fuel retailer, is gradually boosting operations across its refineries and aims to raise utilization to 80 percent by the end of May, compared to 45 percent in early April.Indian Oil's refineries operated at around 60 percent of their design capacities in early May, while plans were to boost those utilization rates to about 80 percent of capacity by the end of this month, the company said in a statement on May 11.The litmus test for demand recovery after a lockdown--China--is showing signs of rebound, according to IHS Markit. In April, China's oil demand reached 89 percent of the demand from April last year, while oil demand is expected to reach 92 percent of the prior-year level in May, the consultancy said.

        "content": "Oil and gas companies, as well as the retail industry, are the worst hit sectors in the COVID-19 pandemic that swept through businesses in Texas, bankruptcy and restructuring lawyers say.  According to data provided exclusively to The Texas Lawbook by Androvett Legal Media research, more than 545 companies of all sectors in Texas filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors between January 1 and May 5, 2020. This is a surge of 133 percent compared to the same period of 2019, Mark Curriden at The Texas Lawbook writes in Houston Chronicle.Within Texas, Houston is the center of the wave of bankruptcies, which include many names in the retail and oil industries, according to the data and to bankruptcy partners at law firms.In April, companies such as Diamond Offshore Drilling and Whiting Petroleum filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. U.S. shale gas pioneer Chesapeake Energy said in May it was evaluating a Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection reorganization--along with other options--as the low oil and gas prices weigh heavily on its finances and substantial outstanding debt.The list is set to grow in coming weeks, according to legal experts.\"Oil and gas and the retail sector had a whole lot of stress even before COVID-19. The only surprising thing is that we haven't seen the explosion of bankruptcy filings already. But they are still coming,\" Lou Strubeck, head of the bankruptcy and restructuring practice at Norton Rose Fulbright, told The Texas Lawbook's Mark Curriden.According to Strubeck, creditors are not rushing for court reorganizations of energy companies because \"they don't know what they would do with the assets and they don't want to run these companies.\"With less capital to invest in bankruptcy restructuring of oil firms than in the 2015-2016 downturn, private equity could sit on the sidelines, and we may see more \"free fall\" bankruptcies and fewer prepackaged bankruptcies, Matthew Cavanaugh, a bankruptcy partner with Jackson Walker in Houston, told The Texas Lawbook.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "title": "Iranian Fuel Tankers Reach Venezuela Despite U.S. Resistance",
        "content": "The first of five tankers carrying Iranian fuel for gasoline-starved Venezuela reached the country's waters during the weekend, Reuters has reported, noting that the vessel Fortune entered Venezuela's exclusive economic zone on Saturday.Venezuela is in the grips of a major gasoline shortage as refineries are unable to operate at run rates higher than 10 percent because of a shortage of diluents necessary for the production of fuels as well as an urgent need for repairs.Iran, a fellow target of U.S. sanctions, last month sent to Venezuela two plane loads of equipment and chemicals necessary for the production of gasoline as it agreed to help Caracas restart one refinery, with a capacity of 310,000 bpd. At the time, sources told the AP that 14 more flights were scheduled to arrive from Iran to Venezuela, some of them carrying refinery technicians.The gasoline tankers are the next step in the support plan, for which, according to reports, Venezuela is paying in gold.\"The ships from the fraternal Islamic Republic of Iran are now in our exclusive economic zone,\" Venezuela's new oil minister, Tareck El Assaimi said in a tweet. The tankers, whose total load is about 1.53 million barrels of mostly gasoline but also some alkylate--a gasoline blending stock--will be escorted by the Venezuelan military because of threats made by the United States, according to Venezuelan officials.A U.S. official told Reuters that Washington was indeed considering moves in response to the tanker deliveries, but they did not elaborate on the nature of these moves.Venezuela suspended imports of gasoline from the United States last year as the political row between the two escalated. Since then, a shortage of the fuel has been building. The state of disrepair into which Venezuela's refineries have fallen due to underinvestment has not helped, either.Meanwhile, a former Iran OPEC ambassador has suggested that countries under U.S. sanctions should set up a club to facilitate trade amongst themselves.\"The increase in the number of countries sanctioned by the United States has provided a better capacity to create alternative solutions to supply demands,\" Mohammad Ali Khabtibi told Fars news agency. A barter form of trade, he said, could make the foundation of this club. By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "title": "Russia Bans All Oil Product Imports To Protect Its Refining Industry",
        "content": "Russia is banning imports of refined oil products, including gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel, to protect its refining industry from cheap imports, according to a decree published on Russia's government portal on Monday.The ban will be in effect until October 1, and includes a ban on imports of gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and gasoil, to ensure the energy security of the Russian federation and stabilize the domestic fuel market, the government says in the decree.   Russia has been considering this measure since early April, after oil prices crashed and led to much cheaper refined oil products outside Russia. In Russia, however, the price of fuels didn't change much because of the nature of its regulations, Russian outlet RBC reported last month.In addition, fuel demand in Russia has plummeted because of the self-isolation and lockdowns to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic in the country, which reported this weekend its highest daily death toll so far. The Russian energy ministry has been considering the ban for more than a month, and proposed the move to the finance ministry at the end of April.According to Energy Minister Alexander Novak, quoted by TASS in April, the ban on fuels imports is aimed at preserving jobs in the Russian refining industry. Demand for oil products at Russia's gas stations crashed by 40-50 percent because of the lockdowns, Novak said at the end of April.The measure to ban fuel imports is a \"forced and not really market-based\" policy, which other countries have also introduced, such as Kazakhstan, Novak said last month.Russia's oil-producing companies are also squeezed by the falling oil demand and the need to cut total oil production in the country by 2 million bpd from April to May as part of the OPEC+ deal. The oil majors in Russia are seeking concessions from the government to help them ride out the period of low oil prices with the least damage possible.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "title": "Tesla Looks To Produce Cars In China With New Type Of Battery",
        "content": "Tesla has made a move away from the dominant EV battery technology, asking the Chinese government for approval to start manufacturing Tesla Model 3 featuring a lithium iron phosphate batteries, Reuters reports, citing a document published on the website of the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.Lithium iron phosphate, or LFP, batteries contain no cobalt--one of the more expensive components of EV batteries and the object of ethical mining controversies since most of the world's supply of cobalt is concentrated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo where child labor is rife.The new batteries for the Model 3 will likely be produced by CATL, a Chinese battery and technology company, and the biggest EV battery maker globally. CATL sealed a deal with Tesla to supply it with batteries in February, for a two-year period beginning in July this year. Soon after, CATL, which also supplies EV batteries to Audi, Hyundai-Kia, Volvo, and Mercedes, said it would boost its production capacity fourfold, for an investment of $3.7 billion. At the time Reuters reported the batteries CATL will supply to Tesla would be lithium iron phosphate ones.According to another report by The Driven, the CATL batteries will be cheaper, not just because of the absence of cobalt but also because the battery maker could dispense with the battery modules. Reuters has calculated that the cost of a CATL-made battery pack for a Tesla Model 3 made in China could be $80 per kWh, which is a fifth less than the battery pack price that many assume will make EVs price-competitive with internal combustion engine vehicles.In March, Tesla set a record in car sales in China despite the coronavirus pandemic, which caused a 40.8-percent drop in total car sales in the locked-down country. The EV maker sold 10,160 cars in China in March, up from just 3,900 a month earlier.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Welcome to Memorial Day weekend, a weekend traditionally filled with fun, food, family--and driving. If you are one of the lucky ones that gets to go out and about this weekend, you're going to find at the pump that gas prices are at a nearly 20-year low.Heading into the holiday weekend, the national average for gas prices, according to AAA, is just $1.94.  per gallon--that's $.90 below last-year levels.The last time gas prices were under $2 per gallon heading into Memorial Day weekend was in 2003, when drivers paid just $1.50 per gallon.But AAA is not expecting a rush on travel this weekend.\"Despite inexpensive gas prices, AAA anticipates this year's holiday will likely set a record low for travel volume,\" AAA spokeperson Jeanette Casselano has said. But AAA declined this year--for the first time in 20 years, to publish a travel forecast for the weekend because of the pandemic, which has made it difficult to analyze the usual economic data needed to reach such conclusions.One forecast that AAA has given is that gas prices will pick up in the coming weeks as more states lift stay-at-home orders.The EIA reported that gasoline demand hit 6.79 million bpd last week. This compares with the 9.429 million bpd a year ago.Still, AAA is expecting there will be some \"short-lived\" uptick in gasoline demand for weekend travelers.But the lack of a forecast for gasoline demand for the holiday suggests that it is at least possible that we may see a shocking up-tick in demand by venturous weekend travelers. This will still be hampered, however, not just by fears of the virus, but also by the dire financial straits that some have found themselves in due to the shutdowns.GasBuddy has said that it, too, is having difficulty generating forecasts. According to GasBuddy, forecasting gasoline prices this summer \"has been the most challenging of any year in GasBuddy's 20-year history.\" GasBuddy's summer forecast sees gasoline prices between $2.15-$2.35 for Independence Day.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

All oil firms suffered from the oil price crash in the first quarter of 2020 and some, like Shell and Equinor, even resorted to cutting dividends in response to the weak operating environment and uncertain recovery ahead.  In absolute numbers, the biggest loss came from Baker Hughes which reported a net loss of U$10.21 billion for Q1 2020. A week earlier, the oilfield services giant said it expected to book a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of US$15 billion in Q1 and planned to slash capital expenditure (capex) by 20 percent this year in response to the crash in oil and gas prices and the COVID-19 pandemic.ExxonMobil reported on a surprise first-quarter loss on the back of hefty write-downs amid the oil price plunge, posting its first quarterly loss since the 1999 merger of Exxon and Mobil.   The coronavirus pandemic will change the world and the oil industry forever, Shell said at the end of April as it slashed its dividend for the first time since World War II to preserve cash and value in a highly uncertain macroeconomic environment.Oil and gas exploration and production (E&P) companies around the world are set to see their total annual revenues plunge by a whopping US$1 trillion this year due to the coronavirus pandemic and its effect on global oil demand and prices, Rystad Energy said in an analysis at the end of April.

        "title": "South Korea Embarks On An Ambitious Renewable Energy Plan",
        "content": "South Korea has made public a long-term energy plan that stipulates a shift to more renewable energy at the expense of fossil fuels and nuclear power.The Korea Herald reports the plan envisages renewable power to rise to 40 percent of the country's energy mix in 2034, up from 15.1 percent currently. In the meantime, the share of liquefied natural gas-fired power generation should decline from 32.3 percent to 31 percent.At the same time, all coal-fired power plants whose 30-year lifecycles expire by 2034 will be retired. This makes about 30 plants, out a total of 60 currently in operation. An earlier report in Korean media said that some 24 coal-fired plants will be converted to gas.The share of nuclear energy will also be reduced substantially by 2034.Currently, LNG is the biggest portion of South Korea's energy mix, followed by coal, at 27.1 percent of the total. Nuclear energy accounts for 19.2 percent of energy generation. By 2030, plans have nuclear's share in the mix shrink to 11.7 percent, and then falling further to 9.9 percent by 2034. Also by 2030, the share of renewables should rise to 33.1 percent before hitting the 40-percent goal four years later.Despite the government's ambitious renewable energy goals, it appears its support for renewable energy source is disproportionate: a recent report from a nonprofit group suggests that South Korea is subsidizing biomass projects so heavily that it has begun to affect solar and wind.The report, by Seoul-based Solutions for our Climate, said the heavy subsidies for biomass--which is considered carbon neutral by Korean legislation--have led to sharp declines in the price of renewable energy certificates, which has made utilities think twice about investing in new solar or wind power capacity. RECs are issued by the government to utilities that include renewables in their portfolio. Utilities developing biomass generation projects were getting a lot more RECs than those focusing on solar and wind.This suggests the shift will not be smooth sailing, but it is certainly an ambitious shift for one of the largest energy importers in Asia and the world.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

The price of China-made Model 3 remains unchanged, according to Tesla China as quoted by Reuters.In North America, the price for a Tesla Model S now begins at US$74,990, down from US$79,990 previously. The starting price for Model X is down to US$79,990 from US$84,990, while Model 3 prices begin at US$37,990, down by US$2,000.The COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdowns have crashed passenger car sales around the world. New car sales in major European markets, for example, plunged by more than 90 percent in April.In the UK, where total new car sales plunged by 97.3 percent year on year to the lowest level since 1946, Tesla Model 3 was the best-selling car last month.In the United States, the picture in April was not as bleak as it was in Europe, although many automakers reported sales at their lowest levels in decades. Dealers and executives hope that prospective buyers will return once they emerge from the lockdowns, the Wall Street Journal reported in early May.Earlier this month, Tesla reopened its factory in Fremont, California, in violation of a shutdown order issued by the health authorities of Alameda County.  A couple of days before that, Musk had said that Tesla would move its headquarters to Texas or Nevada after the Alameda County Health Department told the EV maker that it could not reopen yet as the lockdown measures continue longer than expected.

        "content": "The COVID-19 pandemic will result in the biggest annual drop in energy investments on record--nearly US$400 billion, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said in its new World Energy Investment 2020 report on Wednesday.  Before the coronavirus-driven crisis, the IEA had expected global energy investment to increase this year by 2 percent to what would have been the biggest yearly rise in investment in six years. However, the pandemic and the economic downturn resulting from it will lead to a 20-percent plunge in investments in the energy sector, equal to almost US$400 billion.The oil and gas sector will see the steepest decline in investment this year compared to last year, the IEA has estimated. Investment in oil and gas is set to plunge by US$244.1 billion, or by nearly one-third, in 2020 compared to 2019.\"The shale industry was already under pressure, and investor confidence and access to capital has now dried up: investment in shale is anticipated to fall by 50% in 2020,\" the IEA said in its report.The slashed investments in the oil industry could lead to a tighter oil market than previously anticipated.\"For oil markets, if investment stays at 2020 levels then this would reduce the previously-expected level of supply in 2025 by almost 9 million barrels a day, creating a clear risk of tighter markets if demand starts to move back towards its pre-crisis trajectory,\" the Paris-based agency said.Consumer spending on oil is expected to plummet by more than US$1 trillion in 2020, which would mean there would be a historic switch this year in which electricity will become the largest single element of consumer spending on energy.The renewables energy sector has also felt the disruption from the pandemic and shifting demand, but overall it is more resilient than the fossil fuel sector, the IEA said.Global investment in renewable power projects is set to drop by 10 percent this year, while capacity additions are set to be lower than in 2019 as many project completions will be pushed into 2021.

We will continue to hold these companies accountable for their decades-long campaign of public deception about climate change and its consequences.\"San Francisco is among those eager to sue Big Oil for its role in climate change. In fact, the city, along with another Californian town, Oakland, sued five Big Oil majors alleging a conspiracy to suppress climate change facts. The plaintiffs lost that case at a district court but now the appeals court decision could open the door to what could become a wave of lawsuits against supermajors and smaller energy companies.However, the AP notes, the rulings may not get to a jury at all.

The U.S. moved to ban as of Tuesday the travel of foreign nationals from Brazil into the United States in a temporary move to prevent the spread of COVID-19 from Brazil.According to sources and data from regulators compiled by Reuters, Norwegian major Equinor had around 60 coronavirus cases as of last week, most of which at the Peregrino oilfield, Perenco had 40 cases, while Petrobras had more than 300 workers among staff and contractors with COVID-19.Shell and Enauta had one coronavirus case each, the two companies told Reuters.Petrobras says that it is taking every person's temperature upon boarding offshore units and has adopted work-from-home as much as possible.Days before the production cuts at the OPEC+ group formally began on May 1, Petrobras of Brazil--which is not part of that group--said that it had reversed the cuts it had announced in early April, opting for \"the gradual return to an average oil production level of 2.26 MMbpd in April alongside an increase in the utilization factor of our refineries,\" due to better than expected demand for its products.Yet, the coronavirus pandemic spiraling out of control in Brazil could crush its oil industry, analysts say. Apart from the health of the offshore oil workers, Brazil's oil sector is threatened by the low oil prices and the economic downturn in the country and in the world. Being state-held, Petrobras's ratings are closely related to the credit rating of Brazil.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

U.S. shale gas pioneer Chesapeake Energy said in May it was evaluating a Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection reorganization--along with other options--as the low oil and gas prices weigh heavily on its finances and substantial outstanding debt.The list is set to grow in coming weeks, according to experts.According to Rystad Energy, if WTI Crude averages $30 a barrel in 2020, about 73 oil firms in the U.S. may have to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, and another 170 companies could follow in 2021.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Spending on public projects helped pull the United States out of the Great Depression and created a lasting network of employment that helps support America even today. Now, as the country grapples with a new economic crisis sparked by the COVID-19 pandemic, the timing has never been better to address the country's $3.9 trillion infrastructure dilemma.Across the United States, neglected roads, airports, electrical grids, and water distribution facilities are taking a toll on the American economy. In fact, a report from ASCE suggests that failing to address the nation's crumbling infrastructure could result in a $3.9 trillion hit to the country's GDP by 2025. And that's only the beginning. Businesses too will suffer. Poor infrastructure directly translates into higher costs for businesses, and in turn, consumers. The same ASCE report estimates that not addressing our infrastructure shortcomings, businesses will miss out on $7 trillion in sales, and over 2.5 million jobs will be lost. It s an issue that has gained surprising support from both sides of the aisle. This week, President Trump and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo are set to discuss plans to help address New York's struggling infrastructure. \"There is no better time to build than right now. You need to restart the economy, you need to create jobs. And you need to renew and repair the economy. Now is the time to do it,\" Cuomo explained. \"Let's put Americans back to work. It is common sense.\"Trump, for his part, has been a major proponent of the infrastructure battle, as well, calling on lawmakers to allocate as much as $2 trillion to combat this looming crisis. Related: Oil May Never Fully Recover From This Crisis\"With interest rates for the United States being at ZERO, this is the time to do our decades long awaited Infrastructure Bill. It should be VERY BIG & BOLD, Two Trillion Dollars, and be focused solely on jobs and rebuilding the once great infrastructure of our Country! \" the President tweeted. As lawmakers spat over how to support the economy, addressing this issue is an opportunity to both create jobs and avoid further economic damage. Tackling the country's critical infrastructure and communications shortcomings will be an investment that not only bolsters economic growth during a time where it is desperately needed, but also unlocks new potential in innovation and prosperity for years to come.

        "content": "The flow of natural gas from Russia to Europe via the Yamal-Europe pipeline crossing Poland completely stopped on Tuesday after a two-and-a-half-decade-old transit deal between Russia and Poland expired and after the COVID-19 pandemic battered gas demand in Europe.The Russia-Poland transit deal for natural gas from the Yamal peninsula to Germany, via Belarus and Poland, expired on May 17. Poland has aligned its legislation with the energy regulations of the European Union (EU) and Polish operator Gaz-System began offering capacity bookings on the Polish section of the Yamal-Europe pipeline in accordance with EU regulations.Poland has been trying to wean itself off Russian energy supplies and has become one of the first eastern European countries to have booked U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) cargoes.With the end of the gas transit agreement with Russia, Poland is moving to a more liberalized natural gas market, but it expects that Russia will continue to send similar volumes of gas before the transit deal expired, a Polish official told Reuters last week.For July 1 through October 1, Poland's Gaz-System has already sold 80 percent of the capacity on the pipeline made available as a result of termination of the transit contract, the company said on May 15. The remaining available capacity will be auctioned in June, July, and August at monthly auctions for monthly volumes.But the capacity bookings for the first days following the expiration of the gas transit showed little appetite for gas in Europe, according to analysts.Gaz-System told Reuters that the capacity booked for Sunday was much lower than for the previous days. So, \"there is no need for the pumping stations to work for 24 hours a day at such low orders for the transit service,\" the company said.Commenting on the drastic decline in gas flows from Russia via Poland, VTB Capital said in a note, as carried by Bloomberg:\"Such a significant reduction in gas transit is primarily driven by weak demand in Europe amid warm winter, high levels of gas in underground storage and demand distortion due to Covid-19.\" By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

Let's get it built,\" Savage said as quoted by Bloomberg.The minister went on to say, \"People are not going to have tolerance and patience for protests that get in the way of people working,\" adding, \"People need jobs, and those types of ideological protests that get in the way are not going to be tolerated by ordinary Canadians.\"The podcast prompted a reaction from Savage's spokesperson, who confirmed she had been on the podcast but noted that \"the limitations to public gatherings ... have benefited no one -- including project proponents and any opposition groups.\"Alberta's new government has taken up where Rachel Notley's NDP government left off and has pursued the Trans Mountain pipeline even more relentlessly than their predecessors. With an oil industry pummelled by crisis after crisis and few growth opportunities, the pro-oil government's determination to get the Trans Mountain pipeline built is probably understandable.Work on Trans Mountain's expansion--the project that has attracted vocal opposition--is already underway. Pipe installation in Alberta started last year, and the section is about 60 percent complete, CBC News reported recently, adding that work was now due to begin on a section of the pipeline passing through British Columbia.The province's government joined environmentalists and First Nations in opposing the project, claiming it would increase the danger of spills and leaks both along its route and in the waters around the port of Burnaby where the pipeline is supposed to load oil onto tankers bound for export markets.The Trans Mountain project, which is federal property, has also been challenged multiple times in court. The last win for the project came in January this year, when Canada's Supreme Court dismissed an appeal by British Columbia that aimed to stop work on the controversial Trans Mountain pipeline expansion project.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

And while the total amount of money raised remains undisclosed, the two funds Grok Ventures and Squadron Energy raised tens of millions of dollars during this first capital raise. The total cost of the project is expected to be around $13 billion.Guardian Geomatics will commence preparations this month, with initial plans to utilize sister company Guardian Offshore's vessel \"Offshore Solution\" to deliver the work, starting later in 2020.The 15,000 hectare, 10GW solar farm near Tennant Creek in Australia's Northern Territory is the largest solar farm in the world currently under development. The project also includes plans for a massive 50-megawatt battery storage facility which ensures a steady around the clock energy supply.Most of the energy from the project will be exported through the undersea cable to Singapore, but a small part will be delivered to consumers in and around Darwin.Related: Driving Season Won't Save Gas DemandSun Cable expects to reach financial close for the megaproject somewhere in 2023, with full commercial operations starting in 2027.  As an island nation with limited space for power generation, Singapore has relied on LNG imports for about 95 percent of its electricity needs and despite the growth in solar PV and other renewables, Singapore will continue to rely on natural gas for the next 50 years or so.Solar PVs contributed 174.3 MW in 2019, or just a meager 1.3 percent of total electricity capacity.

The Brazilian oil firm has hired BNP Paribas Securities, BofA Securities, Itau BBA USA Securities, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Scotia Capital (USA), and SMBC Nikko Securities Americas to conduct the bond issue as coordinators, Petrobras said in a statement.PGF will use the net proceeds from the bond issue for general corporate purposes.Earlier this month, Petrobras was said to have suspended preparations to sell a minority stake in a cluster of four offshore fields producing 230,000 bpd.Petrobras has been selling non-core assets and minority stakes in oilfields in Brazil and elsewhere, aiming to cut its massive debt. But the coronavirus pandemic and the oil price crash that followed have upended Petrobras's plans to proceed with a sale of a minority stake in the Marlim cluster of four oilfields, according to Reuters sources.Moreover, the coronavirus pandemic spiraling out of control in Brazil could crush its oil industry, analysts say. Apart from the health of the offshore oil workers, Brazil's oil sector is threatened by the low oil prices and the economic downturn in the country and in the world. Being state-held, Petrobras's ratings are closely related to the credit rating of Brazil.Earlier this month, Fitch Ratings revised the outlook for the international long-term ratings of several Brazilian corporates, including Petrobras, to 'negative' from 'stable' after it revised Brazil's Sovereign Rating Outlook to 'negative' from 'stable'. Fitch affirmed Petrobras's BB- long-term issuer default rating, but the outlook is now 'negative' compared to 'stable' prior to the latest rating action.

        "title": "U.S. Renewable Energy Consumption Beats Coal For First Time In 130 Years",
        "content": "The rise of renewables and declining coal electricity generation resulted in energy consumption from renewables in the United States surpassing in 2019 coal consumption for the first time since 1885, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Thursday.  Last year, total U.S. renewable energy consumption increased by 1 percent compared to 2018, while coal consumption slumped by almost 15 percent year on year, the EIA said in its Monthly Energy Review.  The rise of renewable energy sources, especially wind and solar power, marked a historic milestone for energy consumption in the United States last year: for the first time since the Industrial Revolution, renewable energy sources overtook coal as source of energy.   In 2019, energy consumption from coal dropped for a sixth year in a row, to its lowest level since 1964, according to EIA's estimates using a fossil fuel equivalence to calculate electricity consumption of non-combustible renewables such as wind, hydro, solar, and geothermal energy. Due to rising natural gas production and increased natural gas-powered generation, coal-fired electricity generation capacity continues to retire in the U.S. Following coal capacity retirements, electricity generation from coal has dropped significantly over the past decade to the point of reaching its lowest level in 42 years in 2019.At the same time, renewable energy consumption in the U.S. increased last year for a fourth consecutive year to a record-high of 11.5 quadrillion British thermal units (Btu)--EIA's common units of heat. Over the past five years, the rise in U.S. renewable energy was almost entirely due to the growing wind and solar electricity generation, the EIA said. Last year, wind power generation overtook hydropower for the first time ever to become the most-used source of renewable energy for electricity generation in the United States on an annual basis.The recent trends in U.S. electricity generation continue into 2020--hydropower plants, solar farms, and wind farms generated more electricity than coal in the United States for a record 40 days in a row, the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis said in a report earlier this month.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Alberta has cut oil production by 1 million bpd so far, the province's Energy Minister, Sonya Savage, has told OPEC, according to Reuters.\"The Minister stated there is currently no point in announcing additional output adjustments, as production has come down on its own,\" OPEC said, noting that \"Additionally, the province already had mandated adjustments in place prior to COVID-19 due to a lack of pipeline capacity and inability to move the oil out of the producing region.\"Indeed, Alberta has been a step ahead of other producers when it came to cutting production, although not by design. Pipeline constraints had already forced Canadian crude prices low enough for many producers to struggle to survive, and the fallout of the oil price war and the coronavirus pandemic only sped up the inevitable: forced production cuts on top of government-instituted ones.Alberta's oil sector was one of the first and hardest hit by the crisis, with doubts emerging at one point about whether the oil sands industry would even survive this crisis. The industry itself is pessimistic. A recent Business Outlook Survey from the Bank of Canada found that the industry was more pessimistic about its outlook than it was in either 2008, during the Great Recession, or even 2014 when oil price last fell in the $20s and below.Now, however, as prices begin to improve, some Canadian producers are starting to reverse production cuts, according to the Canadian Press. The production restart is tentative, however, and companies are ready to reverse it again if prices move in an unfavourable direction. For now, this seems unlikely, according to some analysts.\"As long as nobody cheats on their [production] cuts and we continue to see states opening up, provinces in Canada opening up, other jurisdictions around the world opening up, it's more tailwind to the price,\" Phil Skolnick from Eight Capital told the Canadian Press.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

The blockade came amid continued fighting between the LNA, which is loyal to the eastern Libyan government and the forces loyal to the Government of National Accord, which is recognized by the United Nations.Soon after the blockade, NOC declared force majeure on oil exports, with the company's chairman Mustafa Sanalla warning that the blockade could end up costing Libya $55 million daily. At the time, the losses in production were estimated at between 500,000 bpd and 800,000 bpd. As of late January, Libya's production was around 300,000 bpd but Sanalla said it could go as low as 72,000 bpd. As of early April, production was down below 100,000 bpd. That's down from over 1.2 million bpd before the blockade.Fuel and other oil product output has meanwhile fallen to zero because refineries had to be shut down because of the blockade, too.\"The first quarter of 2020 was a huge decrease in revenues for Libya, as a direct result of the illegal blockade of numerous oil and gas facilities. This is only part of the picture, as the corrosion in pipes caused by still oil and salt water is resulting in physical damage that will cost millions to fix when the crisis is over,\" Sanalla said now.\"Libyan people across the whole country are the ones who will feel the cost of this illegal blockade. The low revenue will simply delay further any government investment in public services, the national economy, and the foundations of future prosperity for Libya,\" he added.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

Under the new plan, oil producers in Russia, with the help of banks, will hire oilfield services companies to drill new oil wells in 2020 and 2021. Those new wells, however, will only begin pumping oil after Aril 2022, when the current OPEC+ deal expires.The OPEC+ group pledged in April production restrictions of 9.7 million bpd in May and June, before easing the cuts to 7.7 million bpd for July through December, and then further to 5.8 million bpd until the end of April 2022.As part of the agreement, Russia pledged to cut its production to 8.5 million bpd in May and June from a February 2020 baseline, or by around 2 million bpd, or by 19 percent, from February 2020, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak told Interfax in an interview last month. According to reports from last week, Russia is almost complying with its share of the cuts, with its crude oil production averaging 8.72 million bpd in the first three weeks of May, as per Reuters estimates.

Many companies have lost over a quarter of their value since the crisis began, and with little hope for recovery in the near term, their share prices are unlikely to bounce bank anytime soon. Despite the market madness, however, energy CEOs are still eyeing massive paydays. Low returns and a general pushback against fossil fuels has left many major investors with little choice but to bail on Big Oil. And now as this global crisis wreaks havoc on financial markets worldwide, things are beginning to look even worse for investors that have held on. Dividends are being cut, production is falling and the price of oil itself looks like it will be sitting in the $30 range for longer than anyone hoped - or expected.Despite the doom and gloom, however, the executives of these entrenched energy giants are still living large, collecting massive checks for their lousy performance. Take Chesapeake for example. The U.S. shale behemoth saw the price of its stock fall from $852 per share to just $13.81 per share. And now it is currently struggling to deal with its some-$9 billion in debt. Chesapeake even announced that it is considering Chapter 11 bankruptcy. But just before their announcement, the company paid out $25 million in bonuses to 21 employees.

Shawn Reynolds, a natural resources portfolio manager at asset manager VanEck noted, \"Executive compensation has to reflect the experience of the long-term shareholder,\" adding \"You can't expect to lose 20 percent of your stock price and get paid just because the industry loses 30 percent.\"By Michael Kern for Oilprice.com More Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

The Russian annexation of Crimea drew reactions from the U.S. and the EU, which imposed sanctions on some Russian energy firms and projects, prohibiting Western firms and banks from working with Russian projects.In an interview with Interfax-Ukraine in March, the Deputy Energy and Environmental Protection Minister of Ukraine, Kostiantyn Chyzhyk, said that the government had agreed with the U.S. Department of State on annual supply of 6-8 billion cubic meters of LNG to Ukraine.\"We have already signed a letter of intent (LOI) with the U.S. Louisiana Natural Gas Exports, Inc. Moreover, they were ready to sign a memorandum with specific figures and obligations, but we legally need some time to work out all the issues to authorize the relevant agencies to sign such a contract,\" Chyzhyk told Interfax-Ukraine two months ago.Ukraine and Poland, which also seeks diversified energy supplies, signed in August last year a trilateral memorandum of cooperation with the United States to enhance the regional security of natural gas supply.Last week, the Ukrainian port Odessa on the Black Sea also received its first-ever crude oil cargo of WTI Crude from the United States, after the U.S. shipped its first oil to Ukraine just last year.

        "content": "The United States is currently considering additional sanctions on the Russia-led gas pipeline project Nord Stream 2 which is planned to bring Russian gas to Germany via the Baltic Sea, outgoing U.S. Ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, told German business daily Handelsblatt in an interview.U.S. lawmakers have sought to pass a bill to levy sanctions on the Nord Stream 2 project, which the United States sees as further undermining Europe's energy security by giving Russian gas giant Gazprom another pipeline to ship its natural gas to European markets.Germany, the end point of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, looks at the economic benefits of the project, while the U.S., including President Donald Trump, have been threatening sanctions on the project and even on Germany over its support for the project.At the end of 2019, the U.S. included in its massive defense bill for 2020 sanctions on companies helping Gazprom to complete Nord Stream 2.Due to the sanctions, which forced Western pipe-laying vessel operators to suspend activities on the project in the Baltic Sea, the completion of the construction of Nord Stream 2 is being delayed from the original completion date, 2020.Russia is now using its own vessels to complete the pipeline laying.But the U.S. is considering further sanctions to derail the completion and the commissioning of the Nord Stream 2 project, Ambassador Grenell told Handelsblatt this week.  \"Further sanctions meet non-partisan approval. Despite the election campaign, legislation could go ahead quickly,\" Grenell said.It's not clear what form possible new sanctions could take. According to Handelsblatt, one option could be to threaten companies helping the project with trade tariffs, while another options discussed in Washington could be to impose sanctions on buyers of Russian gas.  Commenting on the U.S. plan for more sanctions on Nord Stream 2, Nord Stream 2 AG spokesperson Jens Muller told Russian news agency TASS:\"Any such threat with sanctions is an unlawful discrimination against European companies.\"  By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Sales of SUVs have been continuously rising not only in America but also around the world, to the point of exceeding 40 percent of all new car sales worldwide in 2019, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said in its World Energy Investment 2020 report, noting that preferences for larger cars have dampened fuel economy improvements and more than offset the gains by EVs.Over the past decade, the world has seen \"a dramatic shift towards bigger and heavier cars,\" the Paris-based agency said. This shift toward SUVs has doubled the SUV sales over the past decade, and now there are more than 200 million SUVs on the road globally, up from about just 35 million back in 2010. Last year, the share of SUVs in total global car sales topped 40 percent for the first time, up from less than 20 percent a decade ago.  A total of 60 percent of the rise in the global car fleet since 2010 is attributable to SUVs.  From the perspective of oil demand for road transportation, bigger cars support oil demand as more fuel is being consumed. From an environmental point of view, SUVs are making the challenge of cutting transport emissions harder, the IEA said.The trend for SUVs is not only confined to the United States, where half of all car sales are SUVs--it has been \"universal and unrelenting,\" the agency said.\"In China, as elsewhere, SUVs are often considered symbols of wealth and status. In India, sales are currently lower, but consumer preferences are changing as more and more people can afford SUVs, and their share is rising,\" says the IEA.  In the U.S., the Trump Administration is rolling back fuel economy rules.This week, 23 U.S. states led by California \"filed a lawsuit challenging the Trump Administration's disastrous final rule rolling back the nation's Clean Car Standards,\" California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said on Wednesday.\"America's Clean Car Standards were doing the job.

        "content": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) are investigating the most popular exchange-traded fund tracking crude oil prices, the United States Oil Fund, to ascertain if the fund has managed to properly disclose to investors the risks, Bloomberg reported on Friday, citing three sources familiar with the issue.The United States Oil Fund LP (NYSEARCA: USO), one of the most popular oil-tracking ETFs for retail investors, was said to be one of the reasons for the historic plunge in May WTI Crude futures on April 20, a day before the May contract expired on April 21.   Many retail investors were stung by the plunge at the rollover of the May futures contract, and since then, the USO fund has amended its structure, including buying longer-dated contracts instead of front-month ones.Now, according to Bloomberg's sources, the investigation into the USO revolves around whether the fund has properly explained to shareholders that the value of the oil fund wouldn't necessarily track the movement in spot oil prices. The SEC and the CFTC are also looking into the fund's change of strategy to buy crude oil futures contracts with longer expiry.  Related: How Long Until Hydrogen Is Competitive At The Pump?The investigation into USO are still in very early stages and may not result in any allegation of wrongdoing, Bloomberg's sources said, while the regulators haven't found misconduct in the actions of the United States Commodity Funds, the company managing the oil ETF. After the crash in WTI Crude futures last month, the CFTC issued a warning last week \"informing the public about the unique risks associated with certain trading vehicles that use futures contracts or other commodity interests as they make investment decisions during the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic.\"The commission said in its advisory that ETFs tracking commodities \"might not provide investors opportunities to \"buy the dip\" or profit from long-term price gains in the underlying commodity.\"\"This difference is because unlike with stocks, a futures contract cannot be held indefinitely in hopes that a fallen price will recover. Futures contracts expire, and contract holders must either deliver or take delivery of the underlying asset, or close out their contracts by taking an offsetting position before the delivery date,\" the CFTC said in its advisory.

        "content": "U.S. natural gas processing and transmission firm Williams is looking to develop solar installations on land it owns close to its existing facilities in order to power its operations with electricity from solar energy.  Williams owns and operates more than 30,000 miles of pipelines system and handles around 30 percent of the natural gas in the United States.Williams' plan is made possible by the generous federal and state tax credits, the company said in a statement, noting that these solar power installations are expected to be placed into service beginning in late 2021.Williams is considering various sites for the installations, and has initially identified locations in Alabama, Colorado, Georgia, Louisiana, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Virginia.  Colorado will be the first state in which Williams will consider locations for solar installations, company spokesman Tom Droege told The Denver Post. Williams will be picking from around a dozen locations in western Colorado and the Denver-Julesburg Basin on the northern Front Range, and a decision could be made as early as by June, Droege said.\"Given the current market structures and tax incentives, we are able to make these attractive incremental investments while continuing to enjoy the reliability that the grid provides via natural gas fired power generation,\" Alan Armstrong, Williams President and CEO, said in a statement.The declining cost of solar technology and available tax credits makes solar cost competitive to traditional combined cycle power generation, Williams said about its solar initiative, adding that the capacity of each farm will range from 1 megawatt to 40 megawatts, depending on the energy needs of the facility.Williams is not the first firm from the oil and gas industry to consider using renewable energy to power its oil and gas operations. Exploration and production companies in the Permian, for example, contracted over the past years wind and solar power to help meet growing electricity demand for oil and gas drilling. ExxonMobil entered into two power purchase agreements (PPAs), under which the U.S. major will buy 500 MW of solar and wind power from the U.S. unit of Denmark's Orsted in the Permian, Orsted said in November 2018.

Under Total's plan, the French company committed to become a Net Zero Emission Company for all its European businesses by 2050.  \"We are determined to advance the energy transition while also growing shareholder value. Today, we are announcing our new Climate Ambition to get to Net Zero by 2050 - together with society. The Board believes that Total's global roadmap, strategy and actions set out a path that is consistent with goals of the Paris agreement,\" chairman and CEO Patrick Pouyanne said in early May.In recent years, oil and gas majors have been under intense pressure from investors to do more to mitigate climate change and provide greater transparency in their climate-risk and lobbying reporting.This week, climate-related resolutions were put to the vote at the shareholders' meetings of the two U.S. supermajors, Exxon and Chevron, too.Exxon's shareholders rejected proposals for a report on lobbying and a report on the risks of petrochemical investments.A shareholder proposal at Chevron, urging it to report on climate lobbying aligned with Paris Agreement Goals, however, passed, as some 53 percent of the votes cast voted for the proposal to report on climate lobbying.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Elon Musk, Tesla's CEO, has received the option to buy 1.7 million shares in the company at a price much lower than the current market price, potentially making $775 million, MarketWatch reports.The option is part of Musk's compensation package that includes share-buying rights in case certain milestones are hit, such as maintaining a market cap of an average of $100 billion over six months, which is now a fact.Tesla is currently trading at over $800 per share while his option includes a price of $350.02 per share.The company turned in a profit for the final quarter of 2019 that surprised many who were pessimistic about its ability to become profitable. It then stayed profitable during the first quarter as well, strengthening its position as something more than a money-burner. Both quarterly performances were driven by record-breaking car sales.Like other carmakers, however, Tesla, has been affected by the coronavirus pandemic that led to car sales slumps of as much as 90 percent in several major European markets because of the national lockdowns. In the United States sales weakened considerable as well, prompting the luxury EV brand to cut its prices for the whole of North America.The price for a Tesla Model S now begins at US$74,990, down from US$79,990 previously. The starting price for Model X is down to US$79,990 from US$84,990, while Model 3 prices begin at US$37,990, down by US$2,000.Meanwhile, Musk had a run-in with local authorities in the Californian county where Tesla's factory is located. Against their order for non-essential businesses to remain closed, Musk, true to himself, decided to reopen the Fremont factory, filed a lawsuit against the local authorities and threatened to move Tesla's headquarters to another state, shortlisting Texas or Nevada.Tesla, according to its website, is the last major car manufacturer in California and the largest manufacturing employer in the state, with 10,000 workers at the Fremont factory and another 10,000 across the state.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

Home to some of the world's largest private energy companies, Houston lives and dies on oil. But it is also the biggest buyer of....renewable energy. The city of Houston has committed to purchasing 100% renewable energy as a part of a renewed collaboration with NRG Energy. Throughout the seven-year agreement, the city predicts seeing the cost of electricity for the community falling, resulting in $9.3 million saved every year. Mayor Sylvester Turner noted, \"All they see in the city of Houston is Chevron and Shell and Exxon. They kind of look past the city of Houston, but there are some incredible things that are happening in the city of Houston when we start talking about renewables.\" This new deal is just the most recent in a string of initiatives helping to push the city in a more eco-friendly direction. In addition to the renewables pledge, the city is also building new bike lanes and encouraging the use of electric cars. It's even proactively courting Elon Musk to move Tesla Inc. and SpaceX to the \"Space City\" in hopes the offer will help other businesses see Houston for what it really is, rather than simply the global capital of the oil & gas business. The strategy also looks to expand Houston's investments in its own renewable resources, with the goal of powering the city with 100% renewable energy by 2025, rather than purchasing it. Houston is currently the biggest customer of renewable energy in the country, according to the United States EPA.Houston's chief sustainability officer Lara Cottingham explained, \"As a city, we have a really long and strong history of sustainability.

It's unclear if they had to make up the 4-cent difference per barrel--but at any rate, that $43,000 price tag for more than a million barrels of oil is still quite the bargain.Gulf Keystone Petroleum produces 36,000 barrels a day of the Shaikan crude, according to the company's website. Gulf Keystone made the Shaikan 1 discovery in 2009, before selling domestically in November 2010.GKP's full-year after tax profit for 2019 was $43.5 million.Oil managed to stay out of the red in May, with the price of a Brent crude barrel on Thursday reaching over $35 per barrel, as the supply outlook has improved with significant OPEC cuts, and oil demand has improved since April. Brent topped $65 at the beginning of the year.But oil prices are not expected to make a drastic recovery overnight.

They must supply refineries, term buyers. There are simply no resources,\" one source with knowledge of the company's operations told Reuters.This 'pain' for Rosneft may tip the scales in favor of Russia not agreeing to extend the current deep cuts through 2020 - as Saudi Arabia is reportedly suggesting - rather than easing those cuts after June, as per the current OPEC+ deal.Oil executives in Russia, including Rosneft's chief executive Igor Sechin, have often criticized the OPEC+ pact, which began its efforts to fix the market and prop up prices in January 2017. Russian firms have argued that the OPEC+ cuts only serve to prop up U.S. shale production with higher oil prices, giving America more share on the global market at the expense of Russia and its OPEC allies in the OPEC+ deal.  Earlier this week, Russia's Energy Minister Alexander Novak discussed with oil executives the possible extension of the current oil production cuts beyond June.According to a source familiar with the details of the meeting who spoke to Reuters, Russia's oil companies failed to reach an agreement at the Tuesday meeting, as half the firms supported the extension of the current cuts--which means Russia cutting production from around 11 million bpd to 8.5 million bpd--while the other half of the oil executives were against extending the deep cuts and calling for the easing of the cuts, as per the OPEC+ agreement.Russia plans to stick to the OPEC+ deal reached in April and ease the cuts after June 30, Russian officials and industry sources told Bloomberg on Wednesday.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

The tanker has been idling in the area for a week and hasn't continued on its course to Tobruk, the Western diplomats told Bloomberg.  Libya's oil industry is in total disarray after a group of paramilitary formations affiliated with the Libyan National Army (LNA) of eastern Libyan strongman General Khalifa Haftar occupied Libya's oil export terminals in January along with pipelines and fields. The blockade came amid continued fighting between the LNA, which is loyal to the eastern Libyan government, and the forces loyal to the Government of National Accord (GNA), which is recognized by the United Nations.As a result of the blockade, Libya's oil production -which had stood at more than 1 million bpd at the start of January - has collapsed to less than 100,000 bpd. Since the blockade of the oil ports in January this year, Libya's crude oil exports have shrunk by 92 percent and the National Oil Corporation (NOC) has lost some $5 billion, the Libyan state oil firm said this week.\"We implore all the patriot sons of this country to come to reason, prioritize the interest of the homeland, and to re-enable the oil ports and pipelines and allow the National Oil Corporation to carry out its work for the benefit of all Libyans, in order to support the national economy and protect it from the consequences of bankruptcy and dependence on foreign banks,\" NOC said in a statement.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "title": "Developing The Low-Carbon Trade Route Of The Future",
        "content": "A report published by market analyst Lux Research states that companies looking to decarbonize their energy trade routes have about 10 years to do so.According to Lux, by 2030, imported electricity via new high-voltage direct current (HVDC) power lines is likely to become cheaper than low-carbon natural gas turbines. This means that corporations that have renewable energy import infrastructure in place by then, will be able to take advantage of the low prices.The market analyst's document states that there will be another tipping point in 2040 when imported liquid hydrogen is expected to be cheaper than low-carbon steam methane reformation. With these developments around the corner, companies should \"develop the partnerships and pilot projects necessary to demonstrate such a transformative energy paradigm,\" the report reads.In Lux's view, this is particularly the case for enterprises operating in countries such as Singapore, Japan and the Netherlands, which cannot satisfy their own demand for energy with domestically produced renewable energy because they simply lack the land area and resource potential to power their energy-intensive economies.\"Countries representing $9 trillion of global GDP would face difficulties in meeting energy demand with domestic renewable production alone, requiring the import of future energy carriers,\" the paper states.By comparing the lifetime costs of 15 different renewable energy carriers such as electricity and vanadium, Lux's analysis shows that across all renewable energy carriers, low-cost solar energy can be delivered to resource-constrained regions at 50% to 80% lower cost than generating that solar energy locally under less favourable conditions.(Graph by Lux Research).The study presents data that supports the idea that the expanded buildout of AC and DC power lines -- which are currently the only way to connect wind and solar generation to end-users -- will be the most cost-effective way of importing low-cost solar energy from distant regions, though only up to roughly 1,000 kilometres. At farther distances, other renewable energy carriers like synthetic fuels are less expensive. \"Delivering energy via land-based infrastructure like powerlines or pipelines becomes expensive at long distances due to the inefficiencies of power lines and capital costs of pipelines,\" the report reads. \"Delivery via ship, on the other hand, is much more cost-effective at long distances, whether it be LOHC [liquid organic hydrogen carriers] delivered by tanker or liquid hydrogen delivered by cryogenic carriers like LNG.\" Even though at present no current energy carrier can offer costs low enough to completely replace liquid natural gas or oil, Lux believes that imported energy costs can be competitive against other zero-carbon technologies.By Mining.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Not even a full month into OPEC's deep production cut agreement, rumors have already surfaced that there is a difference of opinion over a possible extension of the oil production cuts--as usual, with Saudi Arabia on one side and Russia on the other.But those discussions seem premature, given the latest Reuters survey that suggests that the cartel failed to fully comply with its agreed-upon quotas in May.According to the survey data, Nigeria and Iraq did not live up to their commitments under the massive production cut deal that promised to take 9.7 million barrels of oil production per day out of the oversupplied market.Overall, the survey showed the group cut just 5.91 million bpd from April levels, producing 24.77 million bpd. This is 4.48 million bpd of the promised reduction, or 74% compliant.While some have suggested that the reason for OPEC's failure to bring production down to promised levels is due to contractual obligations with buyers given the short timeframe between the date the agreement was made and its implementation, Iraq has a history of production quota noncompliance.For May, Iraq reached just 38% compliance with its promised cuts.Nigeria was even less faithful to the quotas, cutting just 19% of what it promised, according to the Reuters survey.Despite the few members who failed to being production down as low as promised, OPEC's overall May production was the lowest that it's been since 2002, according to Reuters.The sharp cuts in May, however, are watered down by the fact that several OPEC members, including Kuwait, the UAE, and Saudi Arabia, produced record-high volumes in April, which flooded the market while the world was beginning to see what was a massive drop off in demand.By Julianne Geiger for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Two weeks after Tesla reopened its factory in Fremont, California, the electric vehicle (EV) maker halved the estimated delivery timeline for its Model Y to 4-8 weeks compared to 8-12 weeks just after reopening, leaving aficionados and analysts wondering why the sudden change.According to Electrek's Fred Lambert, one company-specific reason could be that the EV manufacturer has used the shutdown to smoothen Model Y production lines to a quicker-than-usual ramp-up.Tesla started delivering Model Y in the United States in the middle of March--just about the time when the coronavirus pandemic hit major economies outside China, forcing lockdowns and crushing demand for new car sales.Another, more obvious reason for a quicker Model Y delivery timeline could be the fact that demand for new cars, including EVs, stalled during the lockdowns across the United States and some customers may have paused or postponed decisions to buy a car, considering that nearly 41 million Americans have lost their jobs since March.The COVID-19 pandemic and the lockdowns have crashed passenger car sales around the world. New car sales in major European markets, for example, plunged by more than 90 percent in April.In the United States, the picture in April was not as bleak as it was in Europe, although many automakers reported sales at their lowest levels in decades. Dealers and executives hope that prospective buyers will return once they emerge from the lockdowns, the Wall Street Journal reported in early May.In a sign that demand for Tesla's vehicles has been weak these past months, Tesla last week cut the prices of its vehicles in North America to spur demand for electric cars now that the two-month-long lockdowns are starting to ease. Tesla cut the prices of Model S, Model X, and Model 3 in North America, but hasn't changed the price for Model Y.   By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Israel, which hopes to become energy-independent with its huge natural gas fields, is aiming to significantly boost its solar power generation over the next decade under a new US$22.8 billion (80 billion Israeli shekel) plan, the country's energy ministry said, as carried by Reuters.The huge Leviathan natural gas field - discovered in 2010 - together with other fields discovered offshore Israel in the past decade such as Tamar, Karish, and Tanin, is expected to help Israel become energy independent.Natural gas currently accounts for around 64 percent of Israel's electricity generation, while solar power generation represents just 5 percent of its electricity output, despite the favorable geographical position to capture solar energy.Under the new plan, Israel expects to have 30 percent of its electricity generated by solar power by 2030, Reuters quoted Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz as saying.While Israel aims to have solar energy at the heart of its electricity generation strategy over the next decade, the country will look to phase out coal-fired power generation by 2026 - a target generally in line with some Western European economies such as the UK and Italy.In the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, another country has recently pledged increased solar generation capacity to meet domestic demand.Related: The Big Tech Company Backing Canada's Oil SandsOPEC member Algeria said last month that it plans to install up to US$3.6 billion worth of solar photovoltaic (PV) projects to produce renewable electricity for export and for meeting increasing domestic power demand.The solar power facilities are expected to have a combined installed capacity of 4,000 megawatts (MW), the office of Prime Minister Abdelaziz Djerad said.The OPEC member, which generates most of its electricity from natural gas, plans to have those solar PV plants installed between 2020 and 2024, the prime minister's office said. Apart from meeting growing domestic demand and positioning Algeria to export electricity, the new solar projects will help it preserve its oil and gas resources, the Algerian government said.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "U.S.-China tensions have bubbled up again, and commodity markets could be caught up in the turmoil, not least LNG. Aviation activity and jet fuel are also in the mix this week, along with corn fundamentals in North and South America, and UK solar power.(Click to enlarge)(Click to enlarge)What's happening? The U.S. move to no longer recognize Hong Kong's independence from mainland China could lead to new tariffs and a potential collapse of the Phase 1 trade deal that promised $50 billion in U.S. energy purchases through 2021. That would be significant for U.S. LNG exporters, after deliveries to China resumed April 20 following a 13-month halt due to the impact of tariffs.What's next? Despite major coronavirus-related lockdowns earlier in the year, Chinese LNG demand has recovered fairly robustly this spring, with imports averaging over 8 Bcf/d in May, a year-on-year build of 9%, according to S&P Global Platts Analytics data. The global LNG market will continue to look to China to be an engine for demand growth this year, helping to balance a historic supply overhang. Normalizing LNG trade relations with China would be critical to efforts by U.S. exporters to benefit from that recovery and by developers of new liquefaction terminals to secure financing for their projects.(Click to enlarge)What's happening? Jet fuel traders across Asia expect to see improved bids for June and July-loading cargoes after major South Korean airlines said they plan to resume international flights. Korean Air is adding 19 international routes on June 1 including U.S., Asian and European destinations. This will increase the airline's operations to 32 international routes, with 146 flights a week from June 1. Asiana Airlines is eyeing similar moves. The airline will resume 13 international routes from June 1 - one to Seattle and 12 to Chinese cities - raising its services to 27 international routes versus 73 before the outbreak.What's next? South Korea's Incheon airport is one of the busiest air traffic hubs in Asia alongside Singapore's Changi airport. Re-opening of flight routes to and from Incheon should lift regional jet fuel demand and propel recovery in refining margin for the fuel. The FOB Singapore jet fuel/kerosene assessment rebounded by more than threefold from its trough of $13.06/b on April 22 to $37.79/b at the Asian close on May 26. Platts assessed the FOB Korea jet fuel cash differential at minus $2.20/b to the Mean of Platts Singapore jet fuel/kerosene assessments on May 28, a solid rebound from an all-time low of minus $4.65/b on April 22.(Click to enlarge)What's happening? The UK's National Grid is seeking capacity turn-down offers from wind and, for the very first time, solar farms during weekends, in an emergency move to secure grid stability. This expensive last-resort action is necessary, the operator says, because of lockdown-affected electricity demand and, in part, rising seasonal solar output. Into this mix comes the announcement that the government has approved the UK's largest solar scheme to date, the 350 MW Cleve Hill project in Kent, while a 500 MW project in Cambridgeshire is close to an application.Related: Have Oil Traders Abandoned Fundamentals?What's next? As the lockdown eases, so working week electricity demand should recover, at last to some extent - but weekends will continue to challenge grid stability with low demand and surplus generation. UK solar capacity stands at 13.4 GW installed, with midday peaks forecast to approach 9 GW into early June. With demand falling below 20 GW at weekends, the grid's challenge becomes clear if the wind blows. The real story, however, is that the midday peak problem would be much worse had solar subsidies not been withdrawn several years ago. Flagship projects like Cleve mask the fact that in the last year, just 195 MW of new solar have been added - an increase of less than 1.5% over the period.(Click to enlarge)What's happening? Prices of corn in Brazil, the world's second-largest exporter of the coarse grain, hit record nominal highs this year as robust domestic demand, low stocks and favorable exchange rates boosted local prices. At the same time, producers in the U.S., the top exporter of corn, are seeing corn prices at breakeven levels due to the collapse in demand from ethanol sector, which accounts for the bulk of the consumption, following COVID-19 related restrictions on movement.What's next? Markets are keeping a close eye on Brazil, as corn prices are likely to ease when the harvest of second corn crop hits the market in June. However, Brazilian corn prices are still expected to be significantly higher than previous years even during the peak supply season, as most of the corn is consumed by the livestock industry, unlike the heavily ethanol-dependent U.S. corn market. U.S. corn prices have already hit multi-year lows recently, reaching $3.01/bu on April 21. The outlook for corn prices remains bleak in the U.S., as the corn planted area in the 2020-21 marketing season is projected to touch a new record, while corn stocks are seen at levels not seen since 1987-88.By Zerohedge.com More Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "The oil price crash has forced producers in Colorado to slash their capital expenditure, suspend completion activities, and release rig crews, leaving just six operating rigs in the state as of May 29 - the lowest number of rigs in at least 28 years.  Lower liquidity and constrained access capital could make life for the companies operating in Colorado's oil patch much more difficult, analysts and industry executives told Mark Jaffe of The Colorado Sun.Due to the price collapse in early March, oil producers in the state - from Occidental Petroleum to the smaller firms - have slashed capital expenditure for Colorado operations by at least half, and many have suspended completion activities until at least the fourth quarter or until oil prices improve.  The rig count in Colorado as of May 29 numbered just six rigs, down from 31 operating rigs at the same time last year, according to data from Baker Hughes. The six rigs in Colorado last week were the fewest rigs in the state in 28 the years since Baker Hughes started reporting rig counts by state, according to The Colorado Sun.Occidental Petroleum, which became the state's top oil producer after it bought Anadarko last year, has slashed its capital expenditure for the Rockies to US$300 million from US$900 million, The Colorado Sun reports.Related: Saudi Arabia Could Set Trend For Higher Oil Prices In JuneNoble Energy has suspended all completion activity, and drilling activity has been reduced to one rig in the Denver-Julesburg (DJ) Basin, the company's President and Chief Operating Officer Brent Smolik said on the Q1 earnings call. Noble Energy plans capex of US$75 million to US$100 million for the option to complete DJ wells in the fourth quarter.PDC Energy, based in Denver, plans capex of US$500 million-US$600 million this year, down by around 50 percent compared to its initial 2020 guidance from February 2020. The company will have one operating rig in Wattenberg and no frac fleets planned until the fourth quarter, president and CEO Barton Brookman, Jr. said on the Q1 earnings call.\"This is the slowest capital pace for the company in many, many years,\" Brookman Jr. noted.By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Renewables stocks have outperformed the broader energy markets in the last couple of months and, while Covid-19 has disrupted supply chains and caused a temporary dip in solar installations, the mid-and-long-term outlook for the sector as a whole remains bright. This is especially true in China, where Jinko Solar, the world's largest solar panel manufacturer has just started operations at the first phase of a $1.6 billion factory in the Zhejiang province. The total capacity of this new factory is estimated at 16GW of panels per year, effectively doubling the total production capacity of the solar giant.With the completion of phase 1 today, the company adds some 4.8 gigawatts of capacity, which is about 4 times the amount of power that was needed to make Marty McFly and Doc Brown's DeLorean travel through time.  Despite investments in new capacity, profit margins are under pressure in the Solar PV market as manufacturers have had to slash prices of wafers, cells and panels time after time to stay competitive as both domestic and overseas demand has dropped as a direct result of the coronavirus. Bloomberg research shows that costs for the abovementioned components such as wafers, cells and complete panels have fallen by as much as 20 percent, mentioning that prices of these manufactured products could be set to fall further in recent months as new mega-factories such as Jinko Solar's latest venture are set to add to supply.Related: Have Oil Traders Abandoned Fundamentals?The steep drop in margins might not be the end of the world for solar giants such as Jinko or LONGi, but some of the smaller players in the markets could face some serious trouble if prices do not recover soon. Solar PV market analysts have already warned of a wave of consolidation in the field as some of the mightier players are either wiping out or gobbling up smaller players. This decade, prices for PV solar panels and components are expected to fall further as Chinese manufacturers have announced huge expansion plans. Tongwei solar announced in February that it would push ahead with plans to construct a 30GW solar cell manufacturing hub in Chengdu, while its peer GCL System Integration has announced the construction of a 60GW mega facility, a move that would make it the world's largest solar panel maker. GCL's megaproject, when completed, would supply about half of total global demand for solar panels. By Tom Kool of Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "A Mexican firm that was instrumental in an oil-for-water swap scheme with the Venezuelan government has declared bankruptcy, saying Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro had terminated their deal.Reuters reports Libre Abordo declared bankruptcy yesterday, citing a press release that said, \"In recent months (we) have faced excessive challenges, from the oil price fall... to pressure from the U.S. government aimed to stop our operations.\"The contract between the Mexican firm and Caracas, which involved the swap of several million barrels of crude oil for food and water, was signed last year. Since there were no cash payments involved in the relationship, there was no danger of violating U.S. sanctions against Venezuela, Libre Abordo told Reuters earlier this year.By late March, Libre Abordo had taken in some 14.3 million bpd of Venezuelan crude that it was to resell on international markets. The company repaid Caracas with corn and water.And yet as international demand for oil suffered the effects of persistent and substantial oversupply coupled with national lockdowns around the world amid the coronavirus pandemic, a lot of oil became unsellable, including, apparently, the Venezuelan crude the Mexican company bought.The South American country, which used to boast the world's largest oil reserves as a source of its wealth, has been struggling to remain a going concern amid hyperinflation, tightening U.S. sanctions, a severe fuel shortage, and the Covid-19 pandemic.Recently, it got a helping hand from sanction buddy Iran, which sent five tankers loaded with fuel its way. The first tanker arrived last week, with one Washington official telling Reuters the U.S. government would consider a response to the Iranian move, although what the response would be remains to be seen. Venezuela is reportedly paying for the fuel in gold as well as for Iranian help in repairing its crumbling refineries to boost local production of fuels.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "Credit Suisse will not suffer any major losses from its exposure to the oil and gas industry, the bank's chairman Urs Rohner told Swiss broadcaster SRF as quoted by Reuters.\"Our oil and gas exposure is possibly a little bit bigger than other European banks,\" Rohner said, adding \"But seen in total, it is relatively small. That's not something where I believe there's a big reason to worry.\"Just last Friday, Credit Suisse oil analyst Bill Featherstone wrote in a note that the oil and gas industry may have passed the worst of the crisis and could look forward to a recovery, albeit a long one.In the last few years, according to Reuters, the second-largest Swiss bank has been actively seeking ties with the oil and gas industry. But that was when prices were on the rise. Now, things may change.Last week, Bloomberg reported that Credit Suisse was working on a review of a segment of its lending business that focuses on high net-worth clients. According to the report, one of the highlights of the review would be lending to clients with exposure to the oil and gas industry, along with the shipping industry: three of the most vulnerable industries right now.The Swiss bank booked a loss from bad loans and asset value declines of $1 billion over the first quarter of the year.Credit Suisse is not the only one reviewing its business with the oil and gas industry. Many U.S. banks are reconsidering their generosity to the heavily indebted shale oil sector now that oil's fundamentals are not as great as they were when the debt was taken on. International banks, for their part, are beginning to turn away from oil--tentatively, to be fair--and towards renewables, under pressure from governments, investors, and the rising tide of environmental activism.By Irina Slav for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:"

        "content": "U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed via phone the OPEC+ production cut agreements on Monday, according the  Kremlin.The discussions included acknowledgement that the current OPEC+ production cuts, of which Russia is a part, would \"lead to a gradual restoration of oil demand and price stabilization,\" the Kremlin said.  Further details of what was discussed with regards to the oil markets was not disclosed.Other topics of conversation between the two presidents were the launch of the Crew Dragon, and Russia's possible inclusion in a G7 summit--which could draw European criticism after Russia was kicked out of the G8 after the annexation of Crimea.OPEC and Russia have also discussed the OPEC agreement over the last couple of days--specifically the parties have been discussing the possibility of extending the production cut agreement by another month or two, although nothing has been finalized. Last week, reports surfaced that Saudi Arabia was pushing for an extension through the end of the year.  Russia, meanwhile, is more in favor of gradually easing the production cuts, which are set to expire at the end of June.The United States has done its part in cutting oil production as well, although not in any concerted effort with OPEC. Rather, oil production has dropped from 13.1 million bpd in the middle of March to just 11.4 million bpd as of week ending May 22.The call came as oil prices have rallied somewhat over the last couple week as data emerged showing OPEC's fairly robust performance in cutting oil production, along with the United States. Brent crude was up 1.90% on Monday afternoon at $38.56, with WTI rising 0.23% at $35.57.But while prices have rallied from negative figures seen in April, U.S. shale would still find it hard--if not impossible--to turn a profit at $35 per barrel.
