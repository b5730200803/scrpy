Overall, we believe that there should be enough interest and regasification capacity from Asian buyers to take additional LNG supplies as the current price level continues to be competitive versus coal which could help prices remain stable at $3 per MMBtu throughout this year\u2019s second quarter.', 'By Rystad Energy']"

The cost of renting a VLCC on the spot market has risen from about $20,000 per day last month to between $200,000 and $300,000, depending on destination.', '\u201cWe find that liquid supply will have to be reduced by around 3.0 million to 4.0 million bpd compared to the current production planning to bring the implied stocks builds closer to 2.0 million to 3.0 million bpd for 2020, which is the level of implied stocks build that we find sustainable in the short to medium term,\u201c Rodriguez-Masiu concludes.', 'By Rystad Energy']"

Two-thirds of the 11 percent that were no longer middle class, migrated to upper-income levels, while a third became poorer.\\xa0', 'And that gap continues to widen. The richest 400 Americans now control more wealth than the bottom 60 percent - it\u2019s the greatest rich-poor divide since the 1920s.', 'Growing inequality is to a large extent behind the negative reaction to globalization that has been morphing into shape over the past several years.\\xa0', 'Modern-day globalization is seen as the inter-dependence of national economies through cross-border movement of goods, services, technology, capital and workers.\\xa0', 'But 175 years of globalization has not resulted in its promised rewards. Income inequality, in the UK and the US particularly, has never been higher, companies have left their home countries to set up factories where labor is cheaper, and the ideal of the European Union offering free movement of labor leading to economic growth has been lost amongst the wave of migrants turning up on European shores. These migrants compete with locals for scarce jobs and are dependent, at least initially, on government handouts.\\xa0', 'Globalization has also been\\xa0', '\\xa0in factories, which have displaced thousands of well-paid manufacturing jobs.\\xa0', 'How did it all go so wrong?\\xa0', 'In a 2019\\xa0', ', Neil Shearing, chief economist at research firm Capital Economics, argues that globalization \u201cpeaked\u201d even before Trump\u2019s trade protectionism resulted in the US-China war, which began in the spring of 2018. He notes that\\xa0', 'Among the reasons Shearing offers for globalization\u2019s peak, are the fact that by 2010, most economies were open and no new major countries were left to integrate into the global economy; that new technologies (like e-commerce) made it less attractive for companies to maintain large, complex supply chains; and that governments started to question the benefits of financial liberalization - the most obvious example being China\u2019s resistance to opening its capital markets to foreign investment.\\xa0', 'He concludes that\\xa0', 'Not just likely, but certain, as shown by the US-China trade war. But Shearing thinks the trade war is only the beginning of a broader backlash against globalization that goes beyond just the United States and China:', 'In other words, a world in which physical walls, and trade walls between countries, is more common - witness Trump\u2019s push to extend the wall on the United States\u2019 southern border - and impediments to trade within countries, such as the political battle between British Columbia and Alberta, over the right to control the flow of Canadian oil. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0', 'For many the fruits of capitalism have shown up as spoilt goods. It\u2019s harder to buy a house, get ahead, save for retirement. Working people are angry at how globalization has left them behind.\\xa0', 'Social upheaval is occurring in a greater number of countries. We\u2019ve seen it in Chile, France, Spain, Germany, the UK (Brexit), Algeria, Iraq, Lebanon, Egypt, Russia, Hong Kong, Venezuela, Chile and Bolivia.', 'Especially in developing nations, ie. South America and Africa, where politicians are\\xa0 pressured by their base, to enact policies that benefit everyday citizens.

They included the imposition of travel restrictions on certain Muslim states; withdrawing from the Paris Agreement on climate change; backing out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership; tearing up and renegotiating NAFTA; imposing tariffs on Canadian paper, washing machines and solar panels; and on imported steel and aluminum.\\xa0', 'Indeed Trump\u2019s \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 credo is naked nationalism - clothed in the hostility of a trade war with China that has made the Trump administration many enemies abroad, especially in Europe, and put it on a collision course with its largest trading partner. Despite a phase one trade agreement signed in January, hundreds of billions of tariffs on either side remain.\\xa0', 'It should be noted that nationalism in Europe has for decades been seen as a dirty word, since it was \u201cnational socialism\u201d in Italy and Germany that gave rise to Hitler and Mussolini. The birth of the European Economic Community through the Treaty of Rome in 1957 was primarily to bury the idea of nationalism in Europe. Its earlier incarnation, the Treaty of Paris of 1951, created the European Coal and Steel Community, whose aim was to pool French and German steel production in order to strengthen Franco-German cooperation and banish the possibility of war.\\xa0', 'As the European Community evolved into the European Union, European elites stood by a vision of \u201cthe European\u201d whose characteristics included a preference for free trade, open borders, and so-called progressive ideas like same-sex marriage.

But a deeper reading of history shows something similar occurred at the turn of the 20th century, when globalization was just starting to gain a foothold in North America and Europe. It\u2019s also interesting to place the coronavirus into this paradigm; when you look at closed borders, social distancing, heightened fear and paranoia, suspicion of others, covid-19 is intensifying the inward-thinking, tribal mentality that over the last few years has become \u201cthe new normal\u201d.\\xa0', '\\n', 'Globalization could be traced as far back as the 13th century with Marco Polo\u2019s adventures on the Silk Road and the establishment of early trade routes through China, the Middle East and Eastern Europe (the Silk Road terminated in Istanbul).
