This increase in production, despite the decline in the number of wells, reflects advances in technology and drilling techniques. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)\u2019s updated U.S. Oil and Natural Gas Wells by Production Rate report shows how daily production rates of individual wells by state contributed to an increase in total crude oil and natural gas production in 2018.', 'Wells classified as non-horizontal in the report\u2014most of which are vertical wells\u2014have decreased 10% from 935,000 in 2014 to 842,000 in 2018. Horizontal wells are relatively less common, but they are growing as a share of the total; the 99,000 horizontal wells drilled in 2014 accounted for 10% of the total. In 2018, 140,000 horizontal wells accounted for 14% of total wells drilled.', 'Although horizontal wells are more expensive to drill than vertical wells, they contact more reservoir rock and therefore produce greater volumes. Only 1% of vertical wells produced at least 100 barrels per day of crude oil in 2018, but 32% of horizontal wells produced at least 100 barrels per day. As horizontal wells became more common, production growth continued as the well count fell.', 'Note: Non-horizontal wells include vertical and deviated wells and wells whose type is unknown.', '\\nEven with fewer wells, U.S. oil production grew from 8.8 million barrels per day (b/d) in 2014 to 10.8 million b/d in 2018. During that same period, U.S. natural gas production (gross withdrawals) increased from about 78.5 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) to 94.8 Bcf/d. Since 2019, crude oil and natural gas production has continued to grow. In November 2019, crude oil production had increased to about 12.9 million b/d and natural gas production had increased to 116.9 Bcf/d.', 'In its report, EIA groups wells into 26 production volume brackets, ranging from less than one barrel of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d) to more than 12,800 BOE/d. Most U.S. oil and natural gas production comes from wells producing between 50 BOE/d and 1,600 BOE/d. In 2018, wells within this range accounted for 9% of active wells that produced 66% of crude oil production and 62% of natural gas production.', 'Source: EIA']"

Investors in cigarettes and other tobacco products pulled out of the sector in droves when it was found to have covered up evidence of public health risks from its products. The oil industry risks going the same way, Cramer said.', 'The analogy is not remotely sound. Tobacco was only ever a whimsical human indulgence, though a highly addictive one. Fossil fuel products, on the contrary, have fueled economic growth and well-being for over a century, lifted billions of people out of poverty, and given humans high standards of living.', 'But Cramer\u2019s comments were the latest example of a trend that has been underway for some time in the financial world. Investors have fallen out of love with fossil fuels in a big way. Why this has happened is of particular importance to Saudi Arabia, now home to the biggest quoted energy company in the world, Saudi Aramco, and still dependent on energy revenue despite the diversification strategy under Vision 2030.', 'A recent report by IHS Markit, the information group in which oil expert Daniel Yergin plays a big role, pointed out that energy stocks have been the worst-performing sector of the booming stock markets of the past decade.', 'Energy now accounts for less than 4 percent of the weightings of the S&P 500 index, compared to 15 percent a couple of decades ago, in a period when the American oil industry has gone through the biggest boom in its recent history, making the US self-sufficient in energy.', 'You would have thought that American investors would have filled their boots with energy shares in appreciation of the US energy miracle, but the opposite has happened. Another energy guru, Halima Croft, the head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, told the ADIPEC conference in Abu Dhabi last autumn that there was a danger the energy sector was becoming \u201cun-investible.\u201d', 'Larry Fink, head of the biggest investment organization in the world, BlackRock, said his firm would divest of the really dirty stuff such as coal, and set restrictions on new investment in other fossil fuels.', 'Fink explained that he was not acting as an environmentalist, but as a responsible capitalist with a duty to clients and investors. Another responsible capitalist \u2014 the UK\u2019s Guardian Media Group \u2014 said it would no longer accept advertising from oil and gas companies.', 'When the big quoted oil companies such as Exxon and Shell reported financial results last week, it did nothing to persuade the financial world that they should get back into energy. Weak profits and cash flows offset the allure of share buyback programs. The shares fell again.', 'The question is whether the unpopularity of energy stocks reflects economic problems in the industry that could prove to be temporary, with good management and better market conditions; or whether it is, as Cramer says, a climate change-induced death knell, compounded by long-term fears about falling demand for fossil fuels and the rise of alternatives such as solar, wind and clean electric cars.', 'The IHS Markit report offered some insight. It was based on a survey of global investors with $98 billion in assets under management, of whom the majority said they were staying away from it because of economic worries \u2014 commodity volatility, low returns and supply-demand imbalances \u2014 rather than environmental, social or governance fears. These were growing in importance, but not on their own enough to turn people off energy stocks.', 'In other words, if the energy industry gets its act together, the investment world would buy their shares again. In fact, 63 percent thought they were undervalued at current levels.', 'The challenge for energy leaders such as Saudi Aramco is to show that they can simultaneously manage the existing difficult economic environment as well as make the pivot toward energy transition in the new environmentally aware world.', '\\nSource: Arab News']"

The monthly cycle points straight down, and the monthly bar graph has given a hook sell signal. This type of signal is very powerful when it occurs on a monthly basis. The hook consists of a move to a new high followed by a close at a lower low. It last occurred at a major high in July 2008 leading to a bear market as depicted below. Oil fell by 66% over the next six months. In 2020, the $45 and $34 lows are likely targets.', 'This projection coincides with political projections. These projections are based upon yearly counts from past historical events. According to these counts, this will be an unstable year in the Middle East centered around Saudi Arabia and Iran. Prompted by the dramatic rise in oil prices into 2008, the oil-rich Gulf states have overspent. Many large projects were begun, and liquidity has shrunk. Very low oil prices will only add to the stress in this region.', 'Chart 1: Oil Monthly Cycle', 'Chart 2: Monthly Oil With Hook Sell Signals', 'Source: Forbes']"

    "content": "['Analysts said they deplored the decision by the resigning Iraqi government to adopt suspicious deals that waste the country\u2019s oil wealth. The move, an apparent violation of the government\u2019s interim powers, was made despite Iraq\u2019s political crisis and the mass protests pressuring the government.', 'The interim government approved a new round of licences, which had first been granted nine years ago by Hussain al-Shahristani, oil minister in the government of Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki. Subsequent investigations claimed the deals were corrupt and unfair to Iraq.', 'Oil experts said the deals were harmful to Iraqi expertise, mortgaged the country\u2019s economy to foreign interests and incurred tremendous losses to the state treasury. They added to rampant corruption at that time, inflated government spending and killed investment and development programmes, the experts said.', 'Former Iraqi Oil Minister Issam al-Chalabi said resigning Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi\u2019s ordering of the Oil Ministry to sign the eighth round of the oil licences was not within the powers of the caretaker government.', 'Chalabi told The Arab Weekly those licences bind Iraq to unfair contracts for more than 25 years and constitute a painful blow to the country\u2019s economic interests.', 'He said history would never pardon those who contributed to squandering Iraq\u2019s oil wealth through contracts that offer oil companies unfair privileges against the country\u2019s interests. He stressed that the contracts had been evaluated by Iraqi oil experts who confirmed violations of Iraq\u2019s national interests.', 'Chalabi said the recommendations regarding the contracts forced the government of former Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi to refuse to ratify them, despite efforts by former Oil Minister Jabbar al-Luaibi. However, Luaibi ratified the previous round of contracts just before the 2018 elections, maintaining \u201clegitimate\u201d banditry, Chalabi said.', 'He added that official data confirmed that policies adopted since the 2003 US-led invasion intentionally impedes development of the Iraqi oil industry. He said the burning of 58.3% of the gas associated with oil production in the Basra, Maysan and Dhi Qar oil fields was an indication of waste.', 'Experts have expressed concern about having the associated gas burned. They said not forcing foreign contracting companies to invest in exploitation of associated gas exacerbates the problem.', 'It appears the aim behind the neglect was to maintain Iraq\u2019s dependence on Iranian gas. Iraq imports about 28 million cubic metres of Iranian gas to run factories and power plants.', 'The United States has given Baghdad an exemption from sanctions imposed on Iran but there is talk about the possibility of not renewing the exemption.', 'The scandal of the oil licences is linked to Shahristani because he had promoted them in coordination with senior party leaders and tried to replace national oil exploitation expertise and management with foreign companies. The contracts made no provision for ensuring transfer of technology or training and developing local professionals.', 'Iraqis remember Shahristani\u2019s promises on October 12, 2009, to boost oil production to 12 million barrels per day within six years and make Iraq one of the largest oil-exporting countries in the world. Observers interpreted those statements as propaganda to win approval for the licensing deal. Ten years later, Iraq\u2019s oil production is 4.6 million barrels per day.', 'Oil theft is another aspect of how Iraq\u2019s wealth is wasted. Reports indicate that smuggled oil is stolen from punctured pipelines or warehouses. Also, oil derivatives intended for government departments or companies were illegally taken and sold.', 'Another illegal practice is reselling subsidised imported oil derivatives abroad because that makes them cheaper than local products in neighbouring countries. Thieves also exploit apparent laxity in surveillance at Iraqi ports and export more than is being declared in cargo manifests by rigging measuring devices.', 'In a report on Basra, the major oil producing governorate in Iraq, the International Crisis Group said: \u201cThe militias in this city have penetrated the security services and are engaged in armed battles over oil and that oil smuggling in the city had led to the creation of extremely complex and powerful oil mafia networks.\u201d', 'In April 2014, Abadi called on the Integrity Committee to investigate allegations published by the Australian Fairfax Media website and the Huffington Post, a US website, under the headline \u201cThis is How the West Bought Iraq\u201d and take appropriate legal action.', 'The story was one of the largest bribery scandal allegations in the world and it involved Shahristani, Luaibi and other Iraqi officials, who allegedly facilitated the sale of billions of dollars of oil to Western countries through Unaoil, a company owned by Iranian businessman Ata Ahsani.', '\\nSource: The Arab Weekly']"

In three short years, suppliers designed, built, and operationalized over 20 frac sand facilities. The largest three mines have a nameplate capacity of 6 million tons each. Congestion, traffic, and incidents are inevitable with so much activity in the Permian, including sand hauling, water hauling, frac crews, drilling rigs, and other well service providers.', 'According to the Texas Department of Transportation, or TxDot, within the 53 counties making up the Permian Basin, over 30,000 traffic accidents were reported in 2019, a 23% increase from 2017, when the first in-basin sand mine became operational.', 'Traffic Incident Data Illustrates Peak in Q4\u201918', '\\nA closer look at the TxDot data reveals traffic accidents peaked during Q4\u201918 with over 9,000 reported traffic incidents, a 54% increase from the beginning of 2017.

Many have noted that the SARS virus was a blip on the global oil market, affecting oil demand and prices only briefly and minimally and the coronavirus is much less deadly. The estimated $40 billion loss of global economic activity from SARS is all but invisible when examining the global economy (see figure), and was trivial compared to the 2008 financial crisis. ', 'Even zooming in on China specifically (second figure), annual GDP shows no significant impact from the SARS crisis. (The very smooth shape of the curve probably reflects the tendency of reported GDP growth to track official goals very closely.) More instructive is the third figure, showing oil demand growth in China and \u201cOther Asia\u201d by quarters, and in the second quarter of 2003 demand is down sharply in both regions before rebounding. Similarly, a year from now, the impact of CV on the global economy should appear fleeting. But the near-term impact could be more significant, especially when considering more specific effects such as on product differentials.', 'Without a doubt, the effects of CV will be different from that of SARS for a number of reasons, especially the fact that, while it appears much less deadly than SARS, it also appears to spread much more easily. And the public reaction might be considered an irrational level of panic (especially given that the flu is much more dangerous yet has minimal effect on people\u2019s behavior or psyches), but it is clearly very real, as air travel to China has plummeted, an effect that could spread to other parts of the world. Which is not to diminish the effect on energy demand from less coffee roasting as Starbucks closes its Chinese stores.', 'The impact becomes more disconcerting when the varied impact on economic sectors is examined. For example, manufacturing will suffer much less than tourism and air travel will be hurt much more than road travel. Indeed, the next figure shows U.S. jet fuel demand and the impact of both the September 11th attacks and the SARS virus are visible, although the former is much more significant.', 'Prices show the effect much more clearly. The next figure shows the differential between the price of a barrel of WTI and prices for jet fuel, motor gasoline, and middle distillate (heating oil in this case, but diesel fuel effectively). Gasoline prices remained robust, but jet fuel and even middle distillate margins were depressed after early March 2003, the date of the declaration of an emergency by WHO.', 'Obviously, there are numerous factors affecting product prices, but if global jet fuel demand drops by 10% or about 1 mb/d for even two weeks, inventories would increase by about 15 million barrels. Given a back-of-the-envelope guesstimate of 200 million barrels global inventories, that represents a big enough increase to affect prices, including for middle distillate which is an (admittedly imperfect) substitute for jet fuel.', 'This means that refineries with lots of hydroprocessing, which maximizes diesel production, will suffer losses compared to those with cracking units that maximize gasoline. The latter tend to predominate in the U.S., the former in Europe and Asia. Product yields also differ by crude, so that Nigerian crudes will be hurt more than U.S. light tight oil. (Talk to Anas Alhajji about #crudequalitymatters.)', 'It is still early days in the CV emergency, and the oil price drop appears overdone, but there is a lot more going on than just the aggregate supply/demand balance tells us. Let\u2019s only hope the devil in the details is a minor demon.', '\\nSource: Forbes']"

That\u2019s been the case in other recent events of geopolitical shocks like the Iran crisis earlier this month, when the U.S. killing of a top Iranian general immediately sent prices spiking higher before rhetoric downplaying fears of a full-blown military conflict sent oil prices sinking lower.', '\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the $5 per barrel decline even before the virus was announced,\u201d Mayor said. \u201cAnd since then, we\u2019ve seen an even more precipitous decline.\u201d', 'Amid the virus, Mayor believes oil prices could fall to a low $50-per barrel range for West Texas intermediate crude and a mid-$50 range for the global benchmark Brent (BZ=F), before recovering.', 'OPEC+', '\\nAt the same time, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries wields some power to stabilize global oil prices by manipulating supply, potentially offsetting some of the price declines triggered by the coronavirus, Mayor said.', 'Some members of the 23-nation coalition were considering moving their previously scheduled March 5-6 meeting forward to February, according to reports this week, in response to the oil price impacts seen by the coronavirus.', 'The implication is that the group would use the earlier convention to deepen a supply cut of 1.7 million barrels per day it had agreed back in December to enforce. Each time OPEC+ pulled forward its meetings over the past decade, the group decided to further curtail supplies to help prop up crude oil prices.', 'Debate abounds over whether OPEC+ today can meaningfully move the needle on prices in the current massive global oil market. However, the group nevertheless has more flexibility in making quick changes to supply than its U.S. counterparts, Mayor said, making it an important lever on the supply-side.', '\u201cI don\u2019t think domestic U.S. producers can be as agile as OPEC+ can be. Their capital budgets have been constrained, access to financing has been constrained, so we have seen Permian growth, production growth rates, on a definite decline,\u201d Mayor said, referring to the slowdown in activity in the U.S. Southwest\u2019s once-booming Permian Basin. \u201cSo it\u2019s still growing but it\u2019s definitely not growing in the way it was growing even 12-18 months ago. So I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see a supply response that can be as rapid as what OPEC plus can do. And that\u2019ll help overall with some of the supply side challenges.\u201d', 'Climate change', '\\nAll else aside, a growing chorus of stakeholders demanding that asset managers divest from fossil fuel exposure to address climate risks has further pressured the energy industry.', 'BlackRock (BLK), the world\u2019s largest investment company, said earlier this month it would exit investments with \u201chigh sustainability-related risk\u201d like thermal coal and would launch new fossil-fuel investment products. These kinds of corporate moves, along with amplifying rhetoric from activists calling for a low-carbon economy, have started to spook the oil industry, Mayor said.', '\u201cThey are very concerned about it, and they are taking action,\u201d she said. \u201cI would say there are two types of responses. There\u2019s one that\u2019s perhaps more of a \u2018Big Oil\u2019 type of response, and I don\u2019t mean that at all in a negative way, but you\u2019ll hear phrases like, \u2018We need to decarbonize the hydrocarbons\u2019 \u2013 because let\u2019s be real, fossil fuels are very important and a real part of our value chain, and they provide power to the planet, but how do we decarbonize that source of fuel?\u201d', '\u201cThen we also hear this sort of \u2018big energy\u2019 response, which is we\u2019re going to focus on electrification, we\u2019re going to more quickly pivot away from gas, it\u2019s not the bridge fuel,\u201d she added. \u201cThe industry is responding on both fronts. They are taking very rapid action, but the crescendo of the messaging is so loud now, the question becomes, can they respond quickly enough and will investors be patient enough with that pace of changes?\u201d', '\\nSource: Yahoo Finance']"

However, should a devaluation of Sterling against the Euro occur post-Brexit, imported EU-piped gas would become more expensive for the UK \u2013 having a knock on effect on the consumer. That being said, alternative avenues of gas imports such as international liquefied natural gas (LNG) create flexible alternatives of energy security for the UK and the gas market will continue to remain competitive while playing a vital role in the UK\u2019s energy mix.\u201d', 'In terms of crude oil, UK exports to EU countries in 2018 accounted for 63% of the country\u2019s total crude oil exports equating to \u00a310.8bn in value, according to UK Government data.

Being able to maintain strong oil and gas ties with the EU will be a high priority for the UK as securing reasonable cross border agreements and preserving export ties for UK oil and gas products are of national importance.', 'Rogers continued \u201cIn the North Sea, there is a number of oil and gas fields either straddling country borders or utilising cross border infrastructure. Past collaborative efforts particularly between the UK, Norway and the Netherlands have enabled cross border developments and generated value for the UK oil and gas industry, something that is unlikely to change as a result of Brexit.\u201d', '\\nSource: GlobalData']"

In 2019, Andrew Latham, vice president of global exploration, asked if there\u2019s room for explorers in a low-carbon future. In 2020, the energy transition will require explorers to focus on highly advantaged oil and gas. Traditional metrics around value, returns, costs, cycle time and product quality with be joined by growing scrutiny of carbon footprint and ESG credentials.', 'Fund managers will feel even more pressure to justify owning oil and gas shares from their customers. Exploration will feel yet more heat as investors question the need to explore at all given the vast discovered resources. We expect exploration will still have its role to play in allowing companies to add lower-cost barrels to enhance the quality of their portfolios and boost near term profits. Some explorers will build exposure to gas for a lower-carbon future.', 'Traditional and new exploration metrics need not be in conflict. Lower-carbon opportunities very often have lower costs and better economics. The challenge for explorers focused on shorter cycle times is to achieve success at a sufficient scale. Most of the best prospects in mature basins were drilled out years ago. Big, valuable prospects exist mostly in new and emerging plays. Companies will drill in the hope of finding something better than the discovered resources they already have \u2013 lower cost and higher margin. New discoveries need to leapfrog to the top of the queue for development. The Majors are likely to remain the prominent participants in high-impact exploration plays. NOCs that are less exposed to investor concerns may also be able to step up their exploration game.', 'Some companies may announce a strategic move away from wildcatting in favour of acquisition-led growth or new energy businesses. Repsol has said it will prioritise value generation over production growth, while focusing on portfolio improvement and cash generation. Repsol sees gas as the fuel for the energy transition and will seek a balanced oil and gas portfolio. Criteria for prospect choice will shift, but oil and gas exploration is not mutually exclusive with a low-carbon future.', 'Some of the European IOCs may give exploration a diminished role as they shift focus to renewables. A diverse inventory of low-breakeven opportunities will be key to thriving as the energy transition unfolds. Companies will hold their discipline and stick to drilling prospects with a clear route to commercialisation.

Two recent events, the September 2019 attacks on Saudi Aramco facilities at Abqaiq and Khurais (which disrupted crude oil volumes) and the January 2020 military operations in Iraq (which did not disrupt crude oil volumes), led to relatively large daily price changes and intraday price movements\u2014movements within single trading days. Intraday prices of front-month Brent crude oil futures for the two events followed a broadly similar path at first: an upward movement as market participants reacted to the news and a downward movement as new information was incorporated.', 'In the case of the September attacks on Saudi Aramco, the initial price increase was delayed because the event took place over the weekend when the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)\u2014the exchange on which Brent futures are traded\u2014was closed. Consequently, when Brent futures resumed trading, market participants had already had two days to react to the news. Brent crude oil prices opened at $71.57 per barrel (b) at 6:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time (EST) on September 15, 2019, before falling to $67.00/b within 23 minutes of trading and $65.09/b after a further nine hours of trading.', 'Prices following the January 2020 military action in Iraq initially played out similarly: an early large upward movement followed by an eventual downward reversion. But unlike the Aramco attacks, Brent was actively traded while the military operation occurred. Although the precise timing of the January U.S. military operation in Iraq varies by report, it took somewhere between three to five hours for the market to react, reaching $67.44/b by 9:00 p.m. EST.', 'The nature of these two events were different. The attacks on Aramco took physical barrels of oil off the markets. According to Aramco, the attacks on Khurais shuttered the 1.2 million barrel per day (b/d) field for 24 hours. Crude oil processing at the Abqaiq facility was reduced to just 2.0 million b/d on September 17, a small fraction of its estimated capacity of about 7.0 million b/d. The January U.S. military operation in Iraq, however, did not directly affect physical barrels in production, storage, or transit, but it did affect the perceived risk that future barrels could be affected.', 'The magnitude of the price changes following these attacks was relatively large and rare. For the past 29 years, daily Brent crude oil prices changed by less than 2% relative to the previous trading day 74% of the time. The 3.4% change on January 2 following the U.S. military operation in Iraq was larger than 95% of the daily price percentage changes in the past 29 years, and the 12.7% change following the Aramco attacks was the largest daily price percentage change in the past 29 years.', 'The intraday trading range (the difference between a day\u2019s highest and lowest prices, expressed as a percentage of the closing price) was also relatively large during the two events. From 1990 through 2019, about two-thirds of all trading days had an intraday range smaller than 3% of the closing price. However, the intraday ranges for September 14, 2019, and January 2, 2020, were 10.4% and 4.8%, respectively, of each day\u2019s closing price.', '\\nSource: EIA']"

    "content": "['In early July 2018, things were looking bleak for general Khalifa Haftar and his Libyan National Army (LNA). A couple weeks earlier, the LNA had seized control of four key ports in the eastern half of Libya, an area that was already largely under its control. It then imposed a blockade on all oil tankers attempting to set sail from those ports, fanning fears of a global supply crunch \u2014 Libya exports a little more than 1 million barrels per day \u2014 and pushing oil prices higher.', 'Eager to keep prices low, US president Donald Trump threatened legal action against Haftar. And Haftar\u2019s usual allies \u2014 France, Egypt, the UAE \u2014 were conspicuously silent this time. The general couldn\u2019t have held out for very long.', 'So, in a move that took many off guard, Haftar\u2019s LNA handed back control of the four ports to Libya\u2019s internationally recognized National Oil Company (NOC) on 11 July, 2018. Oil output soon rose back to usual levels and revenue was again flowing through Libya\u2019s fragile economy. Global oil markets relaxed.', 'Now Libya finds itself in the middle of another blockade, once again imposed by Haftar\u2019s LNA. But this time Hafter is likely to hold out longer \u2014 perhaps much longer. Fears of an ascendant coronavirus are expected to lop off a sizable share of oil demand, pushing prices lower and giving Haftar cover. Moreover, the LNA now controls an additional 30% of Libya\u2019s oil production capacity thanks to recent military gains, giving Haftar more leverage.', 'As always, uncertainty prevails in Libya\u2019s civil war. The blockade, now 13 days old, could end as soon as next week, according to Hamish Kinnear of consultancy Verisk Maplecroft. But it also wouldn\u2019t be surprising if it lasted much longer. \u201cThere is\u2026potential for the oil blockade to stretch on for months as both sides refuse to back down.\u201d', 'Since shortly after the dictator Muammar el-Qaddafi was killed in a NATO-backed mission in 2011, Libya has been locked in a civil war with no end in sight. The war pits the LNA, based in the eastern city of Tobruk, against the United Nations-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) in the western city of Tripoli. Libya has only six million people, but neither side has managed to gain the upper hand \u2014 partly because each is backed by powerful foreign countries, which supply either weapons and mercenaries. The LNA is backed by Russia, the UAE, Egypt, and France, while the GNA is backed Turkey and a number of western governments.', 'In the middle of this fiercely political contest sits Libya\u2019s National Oil Company (NOC), the steward of Libya\u2019s immensely lucrative oil exports. In order to stay out of the line of fire, it works hard to portray itself as a neutral player. Its technocratic chairman, Mustafa Sanalla, assiduously advertises the neutrality of the company on its Facebook page and in press releases.', 'It has not been enough for Haftar. His LNA has long complained that the money NOC makes from its sales of oil \u2014 some $2 billion a month \u2014 often wind up in the pockets of mercenaries who are fighting on the side of the GNA. Such grievances were at the heart of the last oil blockade in July 2018, when he called for the removal of the head of the central bank, Saddek el-Kaber. (In Libya, the central bank is responsible for paying the salaries of civil servants, such as teachers and doctors. But there are widespread concerns about corruption.)', 'If Haftar succeeds in gaining access to a larger share of the central bank\u2019s revenue, he would have \u201cmore resources for the war effort in north-west Libya,\u201d where the capital of Tripoli is based, according to Kinnear.', '\u201cThis would not only be in the form of purchasing more military material, but also to use promises of cash to entice wavering or unaligned militia groups based in the west of the country,\u201d Kinnear writes in a recent briefing. \u201cThe strategy of \u2018buying out\u2019 militia groups was a key aspect of the LNA\u2019s successful move into south-western Libya in early 2019 and into Sirte [in central Libya] in early 2020.\u201d', 'But the LNA would have to keep up its economic siege against the GNA a long time, if it were determined to starve the GNA of revenue. As of October 2019, the central bank had foreign exchange reserves of $77 billion, according to Kinnear, citing central bank data: enough to last months.', 'To resolve a long-running stand off, influential players like the United States may need to play a mediating role, as they have done in the past. In a speech delivered to Chatham House this week, the London-based think tank, the NOC\u2019s Sanallah all but pleaded but for foreign powers to step in.', 'So far, however, there have been few indications that foreign powers are poised to play the role of mediator. A ceasefire agreement in Berlin two weeks ago was quickly violated, and, with oil prices under pressure from concerns that the coronavirus is eating into global oil demand, many may be secretly glad that lower Libyan oil supply is helping to somewhat offset a price decline.', 'The current oil blockade is now about as long as the July 2018 blockade. But outside Libya, concern is muted. According to Kinnear: \u201cSo far there has been no sense of urgency.\u201d', '\\nSource: Forbes']"

Fighting in Libya resurged over the weekend, torching a cease-fire brokered by Russia and Turkey in early January.', 'Who is rebel general Khalifa Haftar?', '\\nThe move is a power play for Haftar, the charismatic leader whose fleet of Libyan militia groups, collectively known as the Libyan National Army (LNA), launched an assault on Tripoli last April that\u2019s taken thousands of lives and displaced more than 140,000 people. The rabidly anti-Islamist Haftar is seen as the strongest power player within Libya \u2014 whose nearly decade-long conflict now involves several international powers \u2014 and his militias control the country\u2019s east and much of its south. The east is home to the lion\u2019s share of Libya\u2019s oil facilities.', 'The output drop in the OPEC state sent the price of Brent crude spiking last week and could be devastating for the Libyan economy. But regional analysts are calling it a quick leverage grab and questioning how long it will last, while noting that ample global crude supply and fears over China\u2019s coronavirus are keeping a heavy lid on oil prices.', 'The 76-year-old commander, who is credited with a major role in defeating Islamic State militants in 2016 alongside U.S. airstrikes, also happens to be an American passport holder. A rival of longtime Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi, Haftar lived in the Virginia suburbs for several years while working as a CIA asset to plot against the former leader. After the Arab Spring, he apparently spent several years back in Virginia to \u201cenjoy his grandchildren,\u201d he told the New Yorker Magazine in a 2015 interview.', 'So Haftar poses a massive headache for the U.S. A former ally, they can\u2019t exactly sideline him; but his violent assault for power stands in the way of a democratic Libya that Washington had hoped for after its NATO intervention helped topple Gadhafi in 2011 during the Arab Spring.', '\u2018The new Syria\u2019', '\\nNine years after a U.S.-led coalition toppled Gadhafi, Libya remains a fractured state, ravaged by civil war and terrorism. And a vast array of competing foreign interests have entered the Libyan arena, including Turkey, Russia, Qatar, France, Italy, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt. The lack of stability and outside influence has led some to call it the new Syria.', 'Russia has deployed a few hundred mercenaries from the paramilitary Wagner Group and others into the country to back up Haftar, while Turkey has sent in a few hundred military advisors to support the GNA. The UAE is carrying out airstrikes in Libya, also to help Haftar.', '\u201cWe want to avoid Libya becoming the scene of proxy wars,\u201d German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said in early January. \u201cLibya cannot become a second Syria and so we need rapidly to enter a political process, an agreement on an effective cease-fire and an arms embargo.\u201d', 'The major players don\u2019t seem to be listening. Haftar is now directing renewed fighting in Libya\u2019s west after a German-brokered conference in Berlin last week ended with external nations calling for a cease-fire and pledging to end their interference in the war-torn country of 6.4 million. The meeting concluded with Hafter storming out before making any agreements, and Haftar and GNA Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj refused to be in the same room.', 'With fresh violence and foreign fighters spilling into the country in the last week alone, the pledges of non-involvement appear to be falling apart.', 'Russian mercenaries and Emirati airstrikes: Who is backing who in Libya?', '\\nLibya has become a near free-for-all for competing international powers: myriad countries are backing the disparate groups fighting on the ground to further their own ideological and financial interests.', 'Turkey, and to a lesser extent Qatar and Italy, support the U.N.-backed GNA \u2014 to the extent that Turkey earlier this month began deploying its own advisory troops to the country at Tripoli\u2019s request. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has also flown some 2,000 mercenary fighters into Libya from the Syrian conflict, which are known to include radical Islamists, to combat Haftar\u2019s forces. Turkey\u2019s support, analysts say, is tied to Ankara\u2019s desire for access to Eastern Mediterranean gas drilling.', '\u201cBecause Berlin didn\u2019t manage to declare a ceasefire or deliver any substantive result, what seems to be happening is Erdogan has every intention to increase that number (of mercenaries) to way beyond 2,000,\u201d Jalel Harchaoui, a Libya expert at The Netherlands Institute of International Relations, told CNBC via phone.', 'Meanwhile the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, France and more recently Russia back Haftar. The UAE and Egypt oppose the GNA \u2014 which they see as a hotbed of Islamism and Muslim Brotherhood affiliates, something that\u2019s anathema to their own governments \u2014 and have sent weapons and special forces troops to support Haftar\u2019s fighters. Experts name the UAE as the most powerful foreign player in the country. In early 2017, Russian mercenaries began appearing in Libya to support Haftar as well, mostly in logistical, support and intelligence roles.', 'For Russia, the move is viewed as a continuation of Moscow\u2019s expansion and leverage over diplomatic channels in the Middle East and Africa.', '\u201cLibya was always looked at (by Moscow) as the perfect passageway to Africa,\u201d Harchaoui said. \u201cRussia is interested in any mechanism that allows it to undermine NATO and promote disunity within European bloc\u2026 Libya is perfect.\u201d', 'No end in sight', '\\nThe UAE in recent years has violated U.S. arms embargoes, delivering planeloads of weapons to Haftar\u2019s fighters. But with increasingly close relations between Abu Dhabi and the Trump administration, Washington has so far declined to openly rebuke the Emiratis. The UAE foreign ministry did not reply to a CNBC request for comment.', 'Over the weekend, the U.N. mission to Libya rebuked the \u201ccontinued blatant violations\u201d of an arms embargo by countries present at the Berlin peace talks.', 'Representatives from all parties are expected to meet in Geneva for further talks, though the date is undecided and regional experts have little faith in the situation improving.', 'So far, peace talk efforts \u201chaven\u2019t translated into anything at all,\u201d Harchaoui said, stressing the fact that more than 2.2 million civilians are currently living under assault.', 'For the myriad foreign actors in Libya, \u201cyou think that the war should continue because your preferred actor hasn\u2019t won yet,\u201d Harchaoui said. \u201cAnd you continue believing in the benefits of brutality, that if the other side is escalating, then you should escalate too, and you should get it done.\u201d', '\\nSource: CNBC']"

One is seasonal winter weakness in demand and the other is the \u201cChinese coronavirus and the implications that it could throttle back demand in the world\u2019s second-largest economy.\u201d', 'U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate oil may \u201cdrop under $50 before the market finds some sort of traction,\u201d says DeHaan.

WTI prices finished 15.6% lower for the month, while Brent lost 11.9% this month. Both logged the largest January loss since 1991, according to Dow Jones Market Data.', '\u201cThe market is betting that the worst is yet to come,\u201d says Manish Raj, chief financial officer at Velandera Energy. There is concern the virus will indirectly lead to economic slowdown in China, as the nation \u201ccontributes to more than a quarter of the growth in global oil demand,\u201d he said. Yet, there is \u201cno doubt that actual oil-demand reduction resulting from coronavirus will be temporary at best.\u201d', 'He said he thinks that the virus-led fears are \u201coverblown,\u201d despite the World Health Organization classifying coronavirus as a global emergency. \u201cWe believe that the market has over-reacted,\u201d says Raj. WHO on Thursday designated the outbreak in China a public health emergency of international concern.', '\u201cWhereas we expect the disease to continue to spread over the next few weeks, it is unlikely to impact oil demand to the extent reflected in the dramatic price drop seen this month,\u201d says Raj. \u201cAs psychological fears give way to on-the-ground reality of sustained oil demand, oil prices will revert back to pre-coronavirus levels.\u201d', 'Brent crude reached a settlement high of $68.91 in early January before news of the coronavirus really took flight.', 'The decline in oil prices has also led a fall in gasoline prices. Even before any real media coverage of the virus, there was a \u201cmiserable period of transportation demand in the U.S.,\u201d points out Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Service.', 'Implied demand for U.S. motor gasoline over the past four weeks as of the week ended on Jan. 24 was at 8.5 million barrels a day, down 4.4% from the same period last year, according to the Energy Information Administration.', 'The average national price for regular gasoline fell to $2.495 a gallon on Jan. 29, below $2.50 for the first time since March, according to data from GasBuddy.', 'DeHaan says given the loss in oil prices, retail gasoline could fall in the $2.30 range \u201cbefore all is said and done,\u201d though a downward move probably won\u2019t last much more than a few more weeks.', 'As for oil, there is \u201cno visible impact to demand just yet,\u201d but movements in oil are being driven by fear, says Jay Park, chief executive officer at oil and gas firm ReconAfrica.

He believes that the impact is already priced in, with WTI falling from $63 to $53 and Brent down from $68 to $59 this month.', 'Keep in mind, however, that \u201csimilar illness-related price declines have had an impact for a limited period of two to six months,\u201d says Park.', '\\nSource: MarketWatch']"

    "title": "This French Lawsuit Is Making Oil Companies Nervous",
    "content": "['A coalition of French NGOs and local authorities took oil firm Total to court this week for alleged climate inaction, in what is being viewed as a test case for environmentalists in their fight against the fossil fuel giants. Even more broadly, campaigners say, the case could be a tipping point in a global struggle to ensure corporations are held to higher standards of social and environmental responsibility.', 'In the landmark case brought on Tuesday, five French NGOs and fourteen local authorities claim Total is not doing enough to limit carbon emissions to mitigate climate change, despite pledges from the company that it would improve its environmental performance.', 'It is the first time a French company has been taken to court for alleged climate inaction, but only the second case to be brought against Total under the French Duty of Vigilance law, introduced in 2017. The law stipulates that French multinationals are responsible not only for their behavior but for that of their subsidiaries, and requires that firms identify and prevent risks caused by their activities, from human rights abuses to environmental damage.', 'The group, which includes Paris-based civil society groups Sherpa and Notre Affaire \u00e0 Tous, and authorities such as the Val de Loire region, first challenged Total in 2018 to take measures to reduce its emissions. In response, Total published a plan that the company claimed would lead the company to cut emissions. The group made the decision to press ahead with legal action after decreeing that that plan was not sufficient to address the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement.', 'In the other case, a coalition of NGOs including Friends of the Earth France allege that Total\u2019s activities in a protected wildlife park in Uganda are causing environmental harm and have led to human rights violations. Highlighting the case further, in December it was revealed that two witnesses in the case against Total had been subjected to harassment by Ugandan authorities and intimidated by gangs who threatened to break into their homes.', 'Both cases, the campaigners say, are a vital test of the Duty of Vigilance law, which was passed following a years-long struggle by civil society and social justice groups in France.', '\u201cIt\u2019s really a paradigm shift,\u201d said Sandra Cossart, director of Sherpa, a Paris-based NGO set up in 2001 to defend victims of economic crimes. \u201cThis is the first legislation anywhere in the world that pierces the corporate veil, so it\u2019s very important that it\u2019s tested.\u201d', 'Speaking to Forbes.com, Cossart said the Duty of Vigilance law \u201cmeans companies have to really think not only about their own risk, but also about the risk for their stakeholders, such as the local communities and environment where they carry out their activities.\u201d', 'The aim is to foster a broader environment in which companies have a general obligation to prevent harm caused by their supply chain\\u2060\u2014a movement Cossart said is gaining ground across the EU. She drew attention to last year\u2019s leak of a draft German law that, if passed, could result in fines for companies and even jail time for executives where such firms are found to have shirked corporate social responsibilities.', 'In the French case against Total, the groups claim the firm is responsible for almost 1% of greenhouse gas emissions, something they say the firm should be taking rapid, substantive action to address. And while the preventative nature of the case means it cannot result in financial claims against Total, the NGOs are hoping the judge will rule that the oil firm\u2019s action on climate change has been unsatisfactory, using the legal system as a lever to actuate a change in behavior.', '\u201cThe main objective of the case is to compel Total to adopt a climate strategy consistent with the Paris Agreement,\u201d said Paul Mougeolle of climate advocacy group Notre Affaire \u00e0 Tous. \u201cGiven that only a 1.5\u00b0 Celsius scenario with no overshoot and no carbon capture technologies provides us reasonable chances to limit global warming to 2\u00b0 Celsius, this is the only climate scenario that can be considered as acceptable.\u201d', 'Mougeolle conceded that forcing private actors and multinational companies to change, especially when they are not bound by law to respect the Paris Agreement, is extremely difficult. Lawyers have instead to rely on general legal principles to hold corporate actors liable for damages or risk.', '\u201cThe French situation is unique thanks to the French Duty of Vigilance law,\u201d Mougeolle said. \u201cHowever, other legal principles can be used in other jurisdictions that might have the same effect as the French law.\u201d', 'But elsewhere too, fossil fuel companies are facing an increasing number of legal challenges. In the U.S., at least a dozen cases have been brought against oil companies by local authorities hoping to recoup costs incurred by the effects of climate change. The oil majors consider the threat so great they have lobbied for the inclusion of a liability waver in carbon tax legislation to protect them from such claims.', 'Action is also forthcoming across Europe. Environmental group Friends of the Earth Netherlands says it is considering legal action against oil giant Shell, following a legal summons from the charity last year demanding action on climate change. In Norway, Greenpeace and Nature and Youth are taking the Norwegian government to Oslo\u2019s Court of Appeal for opening up new drilling in the Arctic.', 'As for Total, responding to media on Tuesday, the oil giant said it \u201cregretted\u201d the French lawsuit. \u201cThe solutions to responding both to the need for energy sources accessible to all, and to the challenges of climate change, require cooperation among the various stakeholders,\u201d a spokesperson said.', 'The case is ongoing.', '\\nSource: Forbes']"

Included in 2019 were net charges for special items of $8.7 billion, compared to net charges of $1.2 billion for special items in 2018.

For a reconciliation of earnings excluding special items and FX, see Attachment 5.', 'Sales and other operating revenues in fourth quarter 2019 were $35 billion, compared to $40 billion in the year-ago period.', '\u201cCash flow from operations remained strong in 2019, allowing the company to deliver on all our financial priorities,\u201d said Michael K. Wirth, Chevron\u2019s chairman of the board and chief executive officer. \u201cWe paid $9 billion in dividends, repurchased $4 billion of shares, funded our capital program and successfully captured several inorganic investment opportunities, all while reducing debt by more than $7 billion. Earlier this week, we announced a quarterly dividend increase of $0.10 per share, reinforcing our commitment to growing shareholder returns.\u201d', '\u201cOrganic capital spending held flat at $20 billion in 2019, further demonstrating our commitment to capital discipline. Within this program, we continued the ramp-up of the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico and progressed our Future Growth Project at the company\u2019s 50 percent-owned affiliate, Tengizchevroil, in Kazakhstan. For the first time in the company\u2019s history, annual production exceeded 3 million barrels per day of oil equivalent,\u201d Wirth added.', 'The company added approximately 494 million barrels of net oil-equivalent proved reserves in 2019. These additions, which are subject to final reviews, are net of reductions associated with the company\u2019s decisions to reduce funding for various gas-related opportunities and asset sales. The largest additions were from the LNG Projects in Australia and deepwater fields in the Gulf of Mexico. The company will provide additional details relating to 2019 reserve additions in its Annual Report on Form 10-K scheduled for filing with the SEC on February 21, 2020.', 'Significant downstream developments in 2019 included the acquisition of the Pasadena refinery in Texas, and the signing of a conditional agreement to acquire a network of terminals and service stations in Australia. Additionally, Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC, the company\u2019s 50 percent-owned affiliate, announced plans to jointly develop petrochemical projects in the U.S. Gulf Coast and Qatar.', '\u201cIn 2019, in addition to flaring and methane emission reduction targets, the company also established new performance goals to reduce net greenhouse gas emission intensity from upstream oil and natural gas production. We entered agreements to increase renewable energy in support of our business and invested in emerging low carbon technologies through our Future Energy Fund and other partnerships,\u201d Wirth stated.', 'At year-end, balances of cash, cash equivalents, time deposits and marketable securities totaled $5.7 billion, a decrease of $4.6 billion from the end of 2018. Total debt at December 31, 2019 stood at $27.0 billion, a decrease of $7.5 billion from a year earlier.', 'UPSTREAM', 'Worldwide net oil-equivalent production was 3.08 million barrels per day in fourth quarter 2019, unchanged from a year ago. Worldwide net oil-equivalent production for the full year 2019 was 3.06 million barrels per day, an increase of over 4 percent from 2.93 million barrels per day from the prior year.', 'U.S. upstream recorded a loss of $7.5 billion in fourth quarter 2019, compared with earnings of $964 million a year earlier. The decrease was primarily due to $8.2 billion in impairment charges primarily associated with Appalachia shale and Big Foot. Also contributing to the decrease were lower crude oil and natural gas realizations. Partially offsetting these items were higher crude oil and natural gas production.', 'The company\u2019s average sales price per barrel of crude oil and natural gas liquids was $47 in fourth quarter 2019, down from $56 a year earlier. The average sales price of natural gas was $1.10 per thousand cubic feet in fourth quarter 2019, down from $2.01 in last year\u2019s fourth quarter.', 'Net oil-equivalent production of 998,000 barrels per day in fourth quarter 2019 was up 140,000 barrels per day from a year earlier. Production increases from shale and tight properties in the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico were partially offset by normal field declines in the base business. The net liquids component of oil-equivalent production in fourth quarter 2019 increased 14 percent to 771,000 barrels per day, while net natural gas production increased 24 percent to 1.36 billion cubic feet per day, compared to last year\u2019s fourth quarter.', 'Fourth quarter unconventional net oil-equivalent production in the Permian Basin was 514,000 barrels per day, representing growth of 36 percent compared to a year ago.', 'International upstream operations earned $731 million in fourth quarter 2019, compared with $2.3 billion a year ago. The decrease in earnings was partially due to write-offs and impairment charges of $2.2 billion associated with Kitimat LNG and other gas projects, partly offset by a gain of $1.2 billion on the sale of the U.K. Central North Sea assets and the absence of a fourth quarter 2018 asset write-off. Also contributing to the decrease were lower natural gas realizations and volumes, partially offset by lower depreciation expenses. Foreign currency effects had an unfavorable impact on earnings of $476 million between periods.', 'The average sales price for crude oil and natural gas liquids in fourth quarter 2019 was $57 per barrel, down from $59 a year earlier. The average sales price of natural gas was $5.71 per thousand cubic feet in the quarter, compared with $6.81 in last year\u2019s fourth quarter.', 'Net oil-equivalent production of 2.08 million barrels per day in fourth quarter 2019 was down 145,000 barrels per day from a year earlier due to the effect of asset sales, major turnarounds and normal field declines. The net liquids component of oil-equivalent production decreased 6 percent to 1.12 million barrels per day in the 2019 fourth quarter, while net natural gas production of 5.75 billion cubic feet per day decreased 8 percent, compared to last year\u2019s fourth quarter.', 'U.S. downstream operations earned $488 million in fourth quarter 2019, compared with earnings of $256 million a year earlier. The increase was mainly due to higher margins on refined product sales and lower operating expenses.', 'Refinery crude oil input in fourth quarter 2019 increased 6 percent to 975,000 barrels per day from the year-ago period, primarily due to the acquisition of the Pasadena refinery in Texas, partially offset by turnaround activity at the El Segundo, California refinery. Refined product sales of 1.23 million barrels per day were up 2 percent from fourth quarter 2018.', 'International downstream operations earned $184 million in fourth quarter 2019, compared with $603 million a year earlier. The decrease in earnings was largely due to lower margins on refined product sales, partially offset by favorable tax items. Foreign currency effects had an unfavorable impact on earnings of $55 million between periods.', 'Refinery crude oil input of 576,000 barrels per day in fourth quarter 2019 decreased 89,000 barrels per day from the year-ago period, mainly due to the major planned turnaround at the Star Petroleum Refining Company in Thailand.', 'Refined product sales of 1.28 million barrels per day in fourth quarter 2019 were down 9 percent from the year-ago period, mainly due to lower diesel and gasoline sales.', 'All Other consists of worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities and technology companies.', 'Net charges in fourth quarter 2019 were $548 million, compared with $419 million in the year-ago period.

Factoring in more than 500,000 tons of CO2 equivalent emission that Maltese powerplants were generating annually prior to 2017 LNG era at a current cost of 24.75 euros per ton makes the case for the less-polluting LNG even stronger.', 'Bringing in LNG was all based on lowering carbon emissions and cutting electricity costs, which the Maltese government said it accomplished.', 'Price falls have led to numerous write-downs and failed LNG deals elsewhere around the world.', 'Toshiba bailed on U.S. LNG last spring, selling at a loss to French energy giant Total, S.A.', 'Energy commodities hedging firm Trafigura in Singapore started off 2019 losing upwards of $250 million because of weak LNG prices, but recovered at the end of the year when LNG prices stabilized and oil price volatility worked in their favor.', 'Some in the industry worry that low prices, and negative headlines about LNG political fights, could upend new deals to upgrade nearshore power plants to the clean energy commodity, known as LNG-to-Power.', 'Jamaica has a similar LNG-to-Power facility in a joint venture with U.S. based New Fortress Energy.

    "content": "['Recent analysis conducted by Rystad Energy suggests that if the fracking activity were to be eliminated on federal acreage \u2013 in accordance with a stated policy goal of at least one presidential candidate \u2013 the result would be a widespread shift of capital from federal to private and state-owned acreage in a bid to replace the lost oil volumes. In other words, a potential fracking ban would likely have a little immediate impact on nationwide oil and gas production figures.', '\u201cEven in the long-term, the impact might be quite negligible as seen from the greater industry perspective,\u201d says Artem Abramov, Head of Shale Research at Rystad Energy. \u201cHowever, the effects of such a ban could have stronger negative effects on one key shale producing region in particular \u2013 the New Mexico portion of the prolific Permian Delaware Basin.\u201d', 'New Mexico has more than half of the most prospective property under federal acreage, in Eddy and Lea counties. While there is federally-owned land across the nation and in each individual state, the distribution is not uniform and is generally more concentrated in the west, especially in the Rockies and along the West Coast. There are 10 states in the US (excluding Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico) with more than 20,000 square miles of land owned by the federal government, of which three states can be viewed as important contributors to domestic hydrocarbon production \u2013 Wyoming, New Mexico, and Colorado \u2013 each of which has between 40,000 and 50,000 square miles of federal land.', '\u201cNew Mexico has the highest relative contribution to activity on federal acreage, where the share of federal lands has been fluctuating at around 60% in recent years. Both Wyoming and North Dakota saw the share of federal acreage, relative to total activity, at close to 25% in the three-year period from 2017 through 2019, whereas horizontal activity on Colorado\u2019s federal land is insignificant,\u201d says Abramov.', 'Oil production from federal lands surpassed 1 million bpd during the summer of 2019, doubling over the most recent two-year period. New Mexico accounted for the largest share of oil production growth in 2018-2019, as shown in the chart above. In North Dakota, federal lands represent only 6% of the overall territory, but much of that acreage is concentrated within the core Bakken shale basin; this explains the state\u2019s high contribution of production from federal property.', 'Total gas production on federal lands in the US Lower 48 excluding GoM exhibits a lower growth rate, largely due to the vast gas production base coming from western and central Wyoming. Still, gas production increased by about 50% between the second half of 2016 and the third quarter of 2019. Associated gas output from Delaware New Mexico\u2019s federal acreage was a key growth driver, yet significant additional contributions came from the Utica Shale in Ohio.', 'In Delaware New Mexico, the federal land share of total activity varies significantly depending on the operator. For the largest operator in Delaware New Mexico \u2013 EOG Resources \u2013 only 40% of the wells that it fracked since 2017 were on federal acreage. Other operators are more intertwined with the federal government: between 63% and 82% of Oxy, Devon and Concho completions in Delaware NM were on federal land. Two other big operators with a low share of fracking on federal lands are Matador Resources and Marathon Oil, both with 25-27% of completions on federal land. Cimarex and Chevron exhibit the highest recent focus on federal land in New Mexico, with 87-90% of activity happening there.', '\u201cA majority of significant Delaware New Mexico operators can maintain activity levels at the current pace (average of 2018-2019) for more than 20 years. If federal acreage is no longer accessible, the inventory size would decrease, but we would still see 10+ years\u2019 inventory at the current pace for most operators, and as much as 19+ years for about half of the group. Needless to say, most of these companies have equally commercial opportunities on the Texas side of the Delaware basin, where federal acreage is practically non-existent,\u201d states Abramov.', 'From a valuation perspective, a fracking ban would theoretically affect the full acreage potential and hence negatively impact the total portfolio value for some E&Ps. Rystad Energy research indicates that as much as $36.5 billion in upstream asset value could be lost in Delaware New Mexico alone. \u201cEven if a fracking ban were to be implemented on federal lands, it is our view that this loss would not be entirely reflected in market movements. This is partly because the market currently puts little value on the long-term acreage potential, and also because the loss in value of federal acreage will result in front-loaded development of private and state-owned acreage. In practice, the loss in federal acreage value will be absorbed by the gain in the value of other acreage,\u201d concludes Abramov.', '\\nSource: Rystad Energy']"

    "title": "Five Reasons Why Big Oil Is Here To Stay",
    "content": "['The investment case for oil companies has been under attack recently. Climate change activists know that the dividends paid by the largest of these companies are among the most lucrative and stable over time, of any payers in the marketplace today. Further, they know these attacks will receive wide coverage precisely because of the criticality of the dividend stability to these companies stock price. It\u2019s a two-fer for these folks. The only thing is\u2026it isn\u2019t true.', 'Dividends are the principle reason to own the shares of the major oil companies. The dividend payouts these days are yielding 4-7 percent, thanks to the depressed equity valuations of the oil majors. As you will note, this is well above most other options, like U.S. 10-year treasury notes as an example. Any threat to the dividend will absolutely bring a \u2018dog diving under the bed in a thunderstorm\u2019 response from the typical investor. They will push the sell button lickety-split. And, of course, that\u2019s just the response hoped for. Smart investors in these companies will pause just a moment for a second opinion. Perhaps one with some facts behind it, like you will read in this article.', '\\n\u201cSustainable\u201d forms of energy are all the rage these days. You can\u2019t watch a money show without hearing from the bloviator de jour about how \u2018Green Energy\u2019 will replace traditional hydrocarbon sources in about ten-years or so. Among these worthies are the CEOs of major institutional holders, like Blackrock or Norway\u2019s Sovereign Wealth Fund and other large banking and fund management companies. These leaders will freely admit they are moving toward divestiture due to the political narratives regarding climate change, stating it as a fact. The truth is they have no rational basis, but are rather yielding to the out-spoken minority \u2018stake-holders,\u2019 who are demanding action on their part to divest \u2018dirty energy sources.\u2019', 'As noted above in this article, we will take a closer look at the investbility of some of the biggest dividend payers on the planet. In doing this we will look past the splashy headlines that the CEO\u2019s of these companies garner in watering-holes like Davos. Get ready for some real analysis, and prepare to sleep well at night knowing your retirement portfolio will be there when you need it.', 'Climate change propaganda and misinformation', 'The stimulus for this article was an article I chanced on by a climate change crisis group called the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, or IEEFA.', 'A little research finds this is an organization that takes its mission as:', '\u2018The Institute\u2019s mission is to accelerate the transition to a diverse, sustainable and profitable energy economy.\u2019', 'Hmmm, what the heck are they talking about, you may wonder? One thing is for sure they have an agenda against the petroleum industry, making their conclusions suspicious to this reader. Now, let\u2019s understand information can be completely accurate and still be misleading.', '\\nI haven\u2019t gone back and fact-checked any of the information linked from this IEEFA article. Instead, I did my own investigation using company documents to see if I could justify my faith in the companies whose viability was being questioned. My results will be revealed in the next section of this article.', 'Like most investigations that start with an agenda, the IEEFA article contains a grain of truth. This \u201cgrain\u201d helps to anchor the disinformation that follows. To wit: many oil companies have outspent cash flows maintaining dividends over the time period measured.', '\\nIEEFA course provides no context here, just raw data. This can be misleading. In the discussion that follows, we will provide some context to help evaluate the concerns that we really have.', 'What is the trend for the future? Are our investments safe, as safe as any stock investment can be, and are the dividends many of us rely upon to maintain our retired standard of living, likely to continue?', 'That\u2019s what I want to know, and I expect if you are reading this article, you do as well.', 'Reasons why super major stocks will remain investible', '\\nLet me offer the following points that should give you more confidence in the ability of these companies to continue earning your trust and your capital on into the future.', 'Dividend Payout Patios (Net income/dividend)', '\\nRatios below 1:1 are considered \u201csafe,\u2019 classically, but safe is a relative term. Over the past five years all of these companies with the exception of Total (NYSE:TOT) bonds sales have been the way they covered the dividend. Currently, they are in the range of or slightly above historical sub 1:1 levels.', 'The context lacking in the IEEFA article, denoted by the hump in the middle of the chart above, represents the full impact of the \u201clower for longer\u201d oil price. The impact of these lower price realizations, and the fact that these companies were also slow to whittle down their capex budgets, meant that the dividend was being supported by borrowing.', 'So what is the truth, if that IEEFA article is so offbase? What are these companies telling us about coverage projections going forward? Let\u2019s look at a few cash flow projections from this cohort.', 'Based on a Brent price of $60, Shell, (NYSE:A) (NYSE:RDS.B) projects free cash flows to rise from around $28 bn in 2020 to about $35 bn by 2025. With current obligations of about $16 bn for dividends, that leaves an increasingly fat amount for stock repurchases.', 'Dividend coverage should improve consistently over this time and shareholders should lose no sleep. The check will be in the mail.', 'ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) recently has struggled to maintain a sub-1:1 cash flow to dividend ratio as my chart above shows. Currently, it is well above that and the current 5.15 percent yield notes the markets dissatisfaction with that situation. That will change and soon.', 'With the Liza field coming on line and with break-even costs in the $30/bbl range, as much $5 bn of free cash could be generated from that project alone. XOM is on track to produce a million barrels a day from the Permian by 2025 with BE costs as low as $20/bbl. Bank America Merrill Lynch recently put out a bullish call on XOM with a price target based on increasing cash flow from these projects of $100/share.', 'Chevron (NYSE:CVX) is a dividend champion that has been increasing its dividend in recent years and lowering capex resulting in its current 0.53 coverage ratio. Market sages will tell you that the safest dividend is one that\u2019s just been raised. CVX consistently ranks as one of the best-managed companies and has a project portfolio that will keep profits gushing in years to come. It grew cash flow by 50 percent YoY in 2018, and current management\u2019s fiscal discipline should maintain that trend over the next few years. It currently covers capex and dividends with a $52 oil price, and has been buying back stock currently at a clip of $4 bn per annum.', 'This has turned into a long article so I will skip the same type of analysis for (NYSE:BP) and (NYSE:TOT) in terms of project portfolios and capex restraint. All of these companies have redesigned their upstream projects to be cash flow positive with oil prices much lower than they are now. In this core group of Super Major energy companies, investors should sleep well at night.', 'Stock buybacks. These companies are all buying back billions of dollars of their common stock every year. This decreases the total dividend payout, and makes the dividend safer for each remaining share of stock. In the past year, Shell has bought back about $12 bn worth of its stock, on a 2018 commitment of $25 bn by 2020. Shell recently announced that weaker than expected oil prices might drag this out a bit. That knocked the stock price down a bit, which I saw as a buying opportunity.', 'Shell will buy another ~$3 bn in Q-1 of 2020. Do investors care if this happens by the end of 2020 or takes a quarter or two more? They shouldn\u2019t. On the plus side, oil prices might rise more than anticipated and share repurchases could be accelerated. As you may have noted things can change rapidly in the oil market.', 'Debt reduction. This is a priority for all of these companies and is being funded through free cash and assets sales with the proceeds going to debt reduction. Portfolio \u201chigh grading\u201d is underway. It\u2019s not perfect and sometimes it one step back for every two steps forward.', 'Picking on Shell once again, the official target for debt to capital is 25 percent. Moving toward that goal for most of 2018, the company has taken a stutter-step higher to the 28 percent range. Part of this was due to lease costs hitting the balance sheet in late 2018. There can be no doubt that lower than anticipated oil prices has slowed this process.', 'Shell management reminds us of this regularly during the analyst calls. What matters to us is that they consider it a matter of the utmost priority. Ben Van Beurden comments in response to an analyst\u2019s question regarding the timing of stock buybacks and debt reduction:', '\\n\u2018So, very clearly, we are still completely intent on buying back $25 billion of shares and we are also completely committed to strengthening the balance sheet by bringing debt down.\u2019', 'Diversifying the product mix to include \u201cGreen Energy.\u201dGreen energy or sustainable energy sources is the path to the future, or so we are repeatedly told. It is only prudent for the big oil companies to seed research and startup companies in this area. So far, none of these efforts have reached the level where they are accounted for separately on the balance sheet however, with the notable exception of LNG.', 'Whether it\u2019s biodiesel in Brazil, or electrical charging stations in the UK, or wind farms in the Permian, or LNG, efforts are being put forth by them all. Whether any of these can turn a profit down the road remains to be seen. For now, it is enough that the exercise is underway, as it raises their ESG profile.', 'Investing in new technologies. These companies all have and are developing more AI expertise with big data. The Shells and BPs of the world all generate huge amounts of data every day. Terabytes upon terabytes of it daily. Historically, the resources to manage this information efficiently just did not exist. Now it does these companies are moving rapidly to integrate and perhaps monetize this technology.', '\u2018AI can help find those cost reductions by tackling a range of problems. Its deployment in upstream operations could yield collective savings in capital and operating expenditures of $100 billion to $1 trillion by 2025, according to a 2018 report by PricewaterhouseCoopers. Most companies declined to discuss their exact spending on AI.\u2019', '\\nAs these resources are deployed in remote locations or refineries, costs will come down as the article quoted above notes.', 'Risks', '\\nOil prices carry the key risk to dividend sustainability over the near and medium term. As we\u2019ve seen in a plus-$50 environment they can all make money and cover their dividends.', 'West Texas Intermediate- WTI, has fluctuated wildly in price over the last 10 years. For the last four however, it has been above $50 except for a couple of very brief periods. I\u2019m ok with economics built on $50 oil.', 'Environmental and Social Governance-ESG, risk must now be built in to the risk profile in owning these stocks. It can be thought of as replacing the old exploration risk that modern technology has reduced dramatically. When I entered the oilfield 40+ years ago, dry holes- ones with no hydrocarbon shows, ran as high as 85 percent of the exploration wells drilled. Today that ratio has more than flipped with dry holes being a rarity. Just what is the extent of this risk?', 'Your takeaway', '\\nThese are the companies that hold the trillions of retirement dollars from 401Ks and Roth IRAs. They are invested in the big oil companies for yield, stability, and to an extent growth. I don\u2019t mind keeping company with the tens of thousands institutional holders of XOM and the other companies we\u2019ve been discussing.', 'The key takeaways for you as an investor in the big oil company dividend payers is that they are all on track to deliver the cash flow that underpins the dividends they are committed to pay.', 'As investors, there is no doubt we need to keep an eye on this ESG divestiture movement. For the short term it represents little threat to the value of our investments. It is worth noting however, the Norwegian Sovereign Wealth fund has endorsed companies like Shell and BP expressly. In a recent Financial Times article Norway\u2019s Finance Minister, Siv Jensen commented that:', '\u2018Ms Jensen said the largest oil and gas majors were given a reprieve because Norway believed such groups were \u2018in all likelihood\u2019 the ones that would make the main investments in renewable energy in the future.\u2019', 'You have a responsibility here as well. That is the task of vetting what you read and take stock in. Ask yourself as read if there is an under-lying agenda that is masked behind the seemingly objective and forthright information being presented?', 'We\u2019ve shown here that information presented this way can be completely factual and still be misleading. Potentially with portfolio damaging consequences if acted upon. Caveat emptor! Protect your wealth!', '\\nSource: Bay Street']"

The move came after Haftar recently escalated a years-long campaign to capture the capital of Tripoli, which sits in the west of the country and is the seat of the United Nations-backed Government of National Accord (GNA).', 'The NOC and Sanalla have been at pains to act and be seen as a neutral party in the long-running conflict between the GNA and the LNA, since supporting either side could invite retaliatory strikes on oil infrastructure. Oil production has suffered intermittent disruptions, but has recently remained out of the line of fire.', 'Libya\u2019s crude exports have already dropped to just 262,000 barrels per day and could fall below 100,000 barrels per day, Sanalla earlier told Bloomberg TV, down from around 1.2 million barrels per day. Potentially more damaging, Libya has scant storage capacity, forcing NOC to halt much oil production and leave crude oil stuck in pipelines, where they could cause corrosion.', 'Blockades of Libya\u2019s Brega, Ras Lanuf, Hariga, Zueitina, and Sidra ports are costing the country $55 million dollars per day in lost revenue, NOC has said. Without that money, Libya may not be able to move ahead with plans to invest in new oil infrastructure. \u201cWe were told that NOC will not receive the requested budget it needs for its ambitious programme to expand oil production,\u201d said Sanalla at Chatham House.', 'Libya\u2019s civil war is the poisoned fruit of a successful NATO-backed campaign in 2011 to oust dictator Muammar el-Qaddafi. Neither side has managed to claim victory because each is being supported by foreign governments, with Russia and the UAE on the side of the LNA, and Turkey and many Western governments on the side of Tripoli.', 'Just a week ago, leaders of many of these countries agreed at a summit in Berlin to uphold an embargo on supplying arms to either side in the conflict. But the deal quickly fell apart. Haftar responded to the agreement by resuming shelling of Tripoli.', '\u201cOver the last ten days, numerous cargo and other flights have been observed landing at Libyan airports in the western and eastern parts of the country providing the parties with advanced weapons, armoured vehicles, advisers and fighters,\u201d according to the United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) on 25 January.', '\\nSource: Forbes']"

    "content": "['The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) will release updated projections of future U.S. energy production and use in its Annual Energy Outlook 2020 (AEO2020) today at 11:00 a.m. ET. The AEO2020 Reference case, which serves as a baseline for exploring the effects of different assumptions about the economy, policy, and technology, projects renewables to be the fastest-growing source of electricity generation through 2050, driven by continued declines in the capital costs for solar and wind technologies. Slow growth in U.S. energy consumption, as a result of continued increases in energy efficiency, and technologically enabled growth in domestic oil and natural gas production lead the United States to remain a net energy exporter through 2050.', 'The AEO2020 Reference case projects domestic energy demand to grow 0.3% per year on average through 2050, slower than the average annual growth of 1.9% in U.S. gross domestic product. This projection is largely driven by continued increases in energy efficiency in the end-use sectors. Gains in appliance efficiency in the residential and commercial sectors, increases in efficiency of new capital equipment in the industrial sector, and increases in fuel economy partially offset the growth in the number of households, industrial activity, and vehicle-miles traveled.', 'The AEO2020 Reference case also projects the share of U.S. electricity generation from renewable sources to double from 19% of total generation in 2019 to 38% by 2050. Solar contributes the most to the growth, more than tripling from 14% of total renewable generation in 2019 to 46% by 2050. Although coal and nuclear generation decline through the mid-2020s as a result of capacity retirements, their generation stabilizes over the longer term as the more economically viable plants remain in service.', 'At the same time, the United States continues to produce historically high levels of crude oil and natural gas. In the AEO2020 Reference case, U.S. crude oil production continues to set annual records through the mid-2020s and remains near 14.0 million barrels per day (b/d) through the mid-2040s. EIA projects U.S. dry natural gas production will reach 45 trillion cubic feet by 2050. The continued development of tight oil and shale gas resources supports growth in these fuels.', 'With the production growth outpacing growth in domestic consumption of crude oil, petroleum products, and natural gas, U.S. net exports of these fuels increase. In the Reference case, the United States will continue to export more petroleum and other liquids than it imports, with a peak at more than 3.8 million barrels per day (b/d) in the early 2030s before gradually declining to 0.2 million b/d in 2050 as domestic consumption slowly rises.

Chinese exports of diesel, gasoline and jet fuel combined jumped 20% in 2019, reaching as far as Mexico, Nigeria and Italy, and weighing on global refining margins.', 'Asian benchmark refining margins for diesel and jet fuel are already languishing at more than two-year lows, and any increase in Chinese shipments is expected to add further pressure. ', '\u201cThe growth in product supplies will far outpace the expected demand growth of transportation fuels, adding pressure to already weak regional cracks,\u201d said Chen Jiyao, oil consultant with FGE.', 'Analysts expect aviation fuel and gasoline to lead China\u2019s export growth this year due to bulging supplies and slackening domestic consumption, with the coronavirus outbreak adding to concerns, pinching refining profits at regional exporters such as South Korea and Singapore.', 'China is already Asia\u2019s No.1 exporter of gasoline and jet fuel, and ranks No.3 in diesel after India and South Korea.', 'OIL SUPPORT', 'Still, with refinery throughput set to jump by 500,000 bpd to 620,000 bpd due to expansions and new refineries, according to analysts at FGE, SIA Energy and Wood Mackenzie, China\u2019s push will extend a bright spot for crude oil demand.', 'While the growth rate is down from last year\u2019s 921,000 bpd, it will still account for nearly half the increase in global oil demand forecast by the International Energy Agency this year.', 'China imports around 80% of its oil needs, and crude imports are estimated to rise by 400,000-480,000 bpd in 2020, according to FGE\u2019s Chen and Seng-Yick Tee, senior director of SIA Energy. This is down from 882,000 bpd last year, according to China customs data.', 'The oil will feed Sinopec Corp\u2019s greenfield 200,000-bpd plant in Zhanjiang, Sinochem\u2019s 60,000-bpd expansion facility in Quanzhou, and the 200,000-bpd crude unit of privately-led Zhejiang Petrochemical Corp which started operations in Zhoushan last December.', 'Increased purchases will be a boon for exporters like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United States, which is looking to boost energy product sales to China as part of Phase 1 of the trade deal.', 'Last month\u2019s Phase 1 pact means China needs to boost buying of U.S. oil, which is mainly light and of low-sulphur, but as the new plants are geared towards processing medium high-sulphur grades, importers will have to find a balance between their refining needs and Beijing\u2019s imperatives.', '\u201cPolitical fiat rather than market mechanisms will dictate flows,\u201d said Michal Meidan, director of the China energy programme at the Oxford Institute of Energy Studies.', '\u201cBaseloads for the new refineries are mainly Middle Eastern grades so U.S. flows will likely push out West African or North Sea oil (of similar quality),\u201d she said.', 'JET FUEL FLOWS', 'Analysts expect China\u2019s exports of diesel, gasoline and jet fuel combined to maintain double-digit growth in 2020.', 'Aviation fuel is set to lead exports with a 20% increase, due to faster expansion in domestic production versus declining demand growth, said Wang Yanting, Shandong-based analyst at consultancy JCL Network Technology.', 'Curbs on air travel amid fears of a new coronavirus epidemic will further dampen jet fuel consumption, which an executive with China National Aviation Fuel Company told Reuters grew at 6.2% last year, down from 7% in 2018.', '\u201cWe were forecasting growth at 6% this year (before the virus outbreak). It could only be lower,\u201d said the executive.', 'Exports of diesel and gasoline, however, will be capped as refiners shift production to make cleaner marine fuels to meet new international emission standards that came into force this year.', 'Refiners will divert more vacuum gas oil, the main feedstock for the production of very low sulphur fuel oil, to marine fuel, reducing diesel or gasoline output depending on plant configuration, refinery officials said.', 'Gasoline exports are still seen growing strongly, however, after surging 27% last year.', '\\nSource: Reuters (Reporting by Chen Aizhu in Singapore and Muyu Xu in Beijing; editing by Richard Pullin)']"

    "content": "['The world we live in today is very different to 10 years ago. What change will this decade bring? I asked our analysts \u2013 across energy transition, power and renewables, macro oils, petrochemicals, gas, upstream, corporate, economics, metals and mining \u2013 to imagine what 2030 looks like. Here\u2019s what they see.', 'Technology \u2013 brave new world', '\\nThe world is decarbonising, the nascent technologies of 2020 now mainstream. Energy storage, at scale, is crucial in balancing a power market dominated by intermittent solar and wind. New generation cobalt-light, high-nickel lithium-ion batteries underpin an industrialised electric vehicle market in which China leads manufacturing and dominates the supply chain. One in four light vehicle sales globally is an EV while autonomous EVs are starting to take off in the mass market.', '\u2018Free\u2019 surplus renewable generation supports green hydrogen pilot projects, threatening fossil fuels\u2019 stranglehold on high-intensive industries, including steel and cement. Hydrogen is emerging as a potentially viable solution for residential and commercial space heating. Industrial-scale carbon capture and storage opens the prospect of prolonging fossil fuels\u2019 life in markets where there\u2019s access to suitable spent oil or gas reservoirs. Among emerging technology bets are bio-methane (net-zero emissions gas), algae (low-emissions biofuels) and biotechnological advances in the food chain that disrupt agriculture.', 'Smart cities: an electrifying experience', '\\nCities in China, California, Japan and Europe lead the way on decarbonisation and how we consume energy \u2013 a sneak peek into what a 2050 world looks like. In these cities, smart homes give us complete control over energy consumption and efficiency. Smart systems connect wirelessly to appliances and control domestic ambience \u2013 cooking, heating, lighting \u2013 cost effectively, choosing when to buy power from the grid, sell it or store it.', 'The power systems in these cities are decentralised \u2013 distributed generation dominated by renewables, supported by grid-edge technologies, such as energy storage and EV charging. Gas is still in the generation mix in a back-up capacity. Universally, massive investment is being made in \u2018last-mile\u2019 distribution to meet steeply rising power demand.', 'New energy and fossil fuel resilience', '\\nSigns of sweeping change are evident, though the energy mix globally hasn\u2019t changed much. Fossil fuels, even coal, are proving resilient \u2013 the only option in many developing economies to readily meet rising energy demand. But zero- and low-carbon energy in power and other sectors are in the ascendancy as costs fall.', 'Efficiency gains and policy focused on consumption \u2013 everything from carbon taxes on fossil-fuel-based fuels and goods to subsidised public transport \u2013 are dampening fossil fuel demand. The decline in coal demand is accelerating; electrification has brought global oil demand growth close to peak, with the developed world already in decline. Gas demand is the most resilient among fossil fuels, with LNG exceeding piped export volumes. Gas growth, though, is coming under threat from new technologies like hydrogen.', 'Oil and gas investment, ESG and finance', '\\nOil and gas products still support the global economy. But the industry is different: upstream is low cost (Middle East and Russia), low risk, lower carbon \u2013 and low employment. Investment focuses on brownfields. Digitalisation, artificial intelligence, nanotechnology and supercomputing are enhancing recovery, maybe even discovery \u2013 though exploration has largely ceased. Environmental pressures have intensified, severely limiting finance availability for oil, perhaps gas. Those banks still prepared to lend insist on ever-higher hurdle rates and faster payback.', 'With the Permian now ex-growth, underinvestment in global upstream and higher finance costs increase the risk of oil price spikes. Downstream is closing capacity in OECD countries as demand declines. Refining assets are increasingly concentrated in growth markets (Asia), growth segments (petchems) and low-emissions refined products that incorporate biofuels.', 'Corporate landscape', '\\nThe industry has consolidated to cut costs so there are fewer players. Strategies have shifted, and the lines have blurred between oil and gas and utilities. The Majors, other large IOCs and a few NOCs have morphed into energy providers, taking power \u2018global\u2019. Power \u2013 generation, grid edge, even retail customers \u2013 is a significant, fast-growing core business built by acquisitions as well as organic investment. Some have even taken the plunge into the supply chains of cobalt, lithium, nickel and copper \u2013 the metals of energy\u2019s future.', 'Legacy upstream and downstream still dominate in most integrated companies\u2019 portfolios, but as a (shrinking) cash cow, with investment limited. A few pure oil and gas low-cost Middle East NOCs are thriving. Many others, IOCs and NOCs, struggle to adapt. Value-driven niche players, perhaps privately backed, make hay for a time as the wider industry churns assets and positions towards low carbon.', '\\nSource: Wood Mackenzie']"

    "content": "['There is simply no sanctuary for Iran\u2019s state run oil industry.', 'China has all but abandoned it because of U.S. sanctions. France will be hard pressed to do business with them due to the extraterritorial nature of the Iranian sanctions, coupled with a history of at least one French bank, BNP Paribas, being fined for running afoul of U.S. sanction policy. The stranglehold on Iranian oil could not be tighter.', 'The message is clear from Washington, buy oil from these guys and risk punishment.', 'Last week, the State Department imposed sanctions on Chinese company Shandong Qiwangda Petrochemical; Hong Kong-based Triliance Petrochemical, and Hong Kong-based Jiaxiang Industry for buying or transporting oil products from Iran, finished in dollars.', 'They also hit two of the executive officers of the companies identified above, Ali Bayandarian, managing director of Triliance Petrochemical, and Zhiqing Wang, chairman and legal representative of Shandong Qiwangda Petrochemical Co., Ltd.', 'One can argue that China is also on Washington\u2019s hit list, so it makes them an easy target. But the United Arab Emirates is not. They are a huge buyer of U.S. defense contractor products and services. But UAE firm Beneathco is now sanctioned for working with Iran\u2019s National Oil Company. That company is seen as a key source of cash for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp\u2019s Quds Force, designated a terrorist group by the U.S.', 'Quds was once commandeered by General Qasem Soleimani, killed by a U.S. drone strike in December setting off hyperventilating remarks by newly minted Iran experts that President Trump was starting World War III.', 'If economic war is akin to the conventional use of weapons and arms, then Iran is under siege. It\u2019s economy has been in a recession for the past two years. The World Bank said it may flatline this year, which is better than contracting. But that was before the latest sanctions squeeze. This move puts other countries on notice and is another major blow to the Iranian economy.', 'It gets worse.', '\\nOn January 10, Trump announced sanctions that went beyond oil and gas and now targeted construction, mining, manufacturing and textile goods. Imports of Iranian goods into the U.S. have fallen to zero. Exports are all humanitarian goods, such as medicines and medical equipments.', 'Consecutive administrations have attempted to bleed the Iranian economy of funds believed to be used to finance terrorist operations around the world. Going after sectors never hit before is part of the Trump Administration\u2019s strategy of \u201cmaximum pressure\u201d.', '\u201cThis latest round further constrains what people are able to do with Iran,\u201d says Alan Enslen, head of Baker Donelson\u2019s International Trade and National Security Practice. \u201cThe prohibitions on what U.S. companies and individuals can do has been a line in the sand drawn long ago. The most significant part of this latest executive order is an expansion of restrictions on what non-U.S. parties can do,\u201d he says about so-called \u201csecondary sanctions.\u201d', 'Foreign companies and the lenders they do business with may, or may not, be in trouble for doing business with Iran. This includes export business, and domestic business. If you\u2019re DHL delivering fabric samples to Iran, the onus is on DHL for shipping a product now under the sanctions policy of the United States. Corporate lawyers will interpret things their own way and take risks as they see fit.', 'Nobody likes this, especially in Europe where companies in the energy space have had relationships with Iran for years, says Enslen.', 'It may even be legal to do business in some sectors with Iran; think healthcare related goods, for instance. But will a bank like BNP Paribas, once fined a whopping $8.9 billion for sanctions violations in Iran, be willing to take on that risk?', 'Business with Iran has decreased since Trump pulled out of the nuclear agreement made under the Obama Administration. Many companies around the world assumed sanctions would be lifted fully on Iran if that nuclear deal remained in place. It never did. Sanctions on oil remained. But most business was not banned. Companies felt comfortable with the risks they were taking in buying Iranian oil, or working in Iran\u2019s oil market domestically.', 'But when Trump pulled the plug on the nuke deal, all the sanctions returned, new ones were added within months, and the European companies that thought all was well on their end were caught between Tehran and Washington.', '\u201cGiven the choice \u2014 do business with Iran or disavow the U.S. financial system \u2014 I\u2019ve never seen anyone chose Iran,\u201d says Enslen.', 'Earlier this month, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke about the Iran policy post-Soleimani at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University.

    "title": "Iraq\u2019s instability threatens oil market security, balance",
    "content": "['The ongoing insurgency in Iraq is at the moment the biggest challenge to the stability of the oil market, said Fatih Birol, executive director of the Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA).', '\u201cThe recent developments in Iraq \u2013 the second-largest producer in Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) \u2013 is the single largest threat to the stable oil market in the short-term,\u201d Birol warned during an exclusive interview with Daily Sabah on the sidelines of the 50th World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meetings in Davos, Switzerland.', 'Iraq has been mired in violent clashes between police and anti-government demonstrators, who are pressing for an overhaul of the country\u2019s political system. Some of the oilfields have been temporarily shut down as the widespread unrest has escalated. Located in Wasit province, the al-Ahdab oilfield, developed by China\u2019s CNPC with an output capacity at 70,000 barrels per day (bpd), had stopped production for a week and resumed Sunday. Badra, another oil field in the same province whose shareholders include Russia\u2019s Gazprom Neft, also faces the risk of closure. The field has an output of about 50,000 bpd.', 'Exempt from the OPEC cut deal since 2016, the Iraqi crude production had delivered a steadily increasing performance. In 2017, the average production was calculated at 5.5 million bpd, the data by Norway-based energy intelligence firm Rystad Energy revealed. The country produced 5.6 million bpd and 5.8 million bpd in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Up until now in January, the output has fallen to 4.7 million bpd, the company said.', 'Both domestic developments in Iraq and the surrounding geopolitical tensions are feeding worries concerning the output in the country, the IEA\u2019s executive director said. \u201cThis is the major potential problem in the short-term. If the output in Iraq is disrupted, it would create a huge impact on prices,\u201d he added.', '\u201cAlthough we are facing serious problems, the oil markets hover around reasonable levels,\u201d Birol said, elaborating: \u201cVenezuela is a very significant producer and its production has almost dropped to zero because of the political turmoil in the country. As a result of sanctions, Iran\u2019s crude exports have remarkably depreciated. The drone attacks on Saudi Arabia\u2019s national oil company Aramco in September, the continuous unrest in Libya and the killing of the Iranian general (Qassem Soleimani) have not yielded major impact on the oil prices. Despite all these developments, oil prices have remained reasonable.\u201d', 'Despite the major developments that could have shocked the markets a decade ago, the oil prices stood around $60 per barrel over the last year. In January 2019, the OPEC basket price was $58.74 and in January 2020 so far the average price has stood at $66. Still, the oil prices spiked as much as 20%, tipping over $70 per barrel in the wake of the September attacks on Aramco facility, crippling half of the production capacity by nearly 50%, but the price quickly retreated to around $60. After Soleimani\u2019s killing on Jan. 3, the prices posted a quick reaction and hit $70 on Jan. 6, but the impact remained ephemeral as the markets saw no concern over supply.', 'Birol explained the reason behind the stabilized and serene markets as the continuous glut elsewhere in the world. \u201cThere is an abundance of oil coming from the U.S., Brazil, Norway, Guyana and Canada. That\u2019s why we are seeing a more comfortable market now. These incidents are somehow tolerated in the current oil market,\u201d he underscored.', 'Venezuela\u2019s production dipped to 0.6 million bpd this month on average from 2.3 million in 2017, 1.6 million in 2018 and 0.9 million in 2019, according to the data obtained from Rystad Energy.', 'Bogged down in political conflict since the overthrow of Moammar Gadhafi, Libya\u2019s oil production has been sporadically disrupted as the National Oil Company has been implementing force majeure and shutting down production operations in some field. Putschist Gen. Khalifa Haftar has also been disrupting the output in some of the fields located in the areas under his control.', 'While the country produced 1.4 million bpd in 2019, its January production has not benefited from the further rise and stands around 1.2 million, the Rystad data showed. However, due to the blockade by Haftar, the production has been staggering since Jan. 18. The National Oil Company of Libya announced on Sunday that the country\u2019s crude oil production has decreased by 76.3%, reaching nearly 284,000 barrels per day, resulting in cumulative losses of nearly $318 million as a result of the blockade by Haftar militia.', 'Ahead of the Berlin conference on Jan. 19, Haftar and the Petroleum Facilities Guard of the central and eastern regions blockaded oil exports on Saturday from Brega, Ras Lanuf, Hariga, Zueitina and Sidra ports with instruction delivered to Sirte Oil Company, Harouge Oil Operations, Waha Oil Company, Zueitina Oil Company and Arab Gulf Oil Company (AGOCO), subsidiaries of the National Oil Corporation. The blockage was estimated to cost a loss of crude oil production of 800,000 barrels per day.', 'Previously the third-largest exporter and producer of OPEC, Iran\u2019s operations have been outstandingly crippled by the U.S. sanctions that were reimposed following the country\u2019s withdrawal from the nuclear deal in May 2018. The Persian Gulf nation\u2019s production, according to the Rystad, was 5.3 million bpd in 2017 \u2013 enjoying the benefits of the 2016 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) deal. In 2019, the Iranian crude output fell to 3.7 million and in January this year, it has averaged at 2.7 million bpd, Rystad said.', 'Demand security key word for producers', 'In an elaboration on the supply outlook of the oil and gas markets, Birol strongly emphasized that the world is embarking on a new period of \u201cabundance\u201d in energy supply.', '\u201cIn oil, natural gas and renewable energy, the projection is rising and will keep increasing to a great extent. At the same time, the soaring output is putting downward pressure on prices,\u201d Birol explained.', 'The IEA executive chairman drew attention to a significant changing dynamic of the energy markets, a dynamic shifting in favor of the big importers. Five or six years ago, Birol opined, major gas producers had the strongest leverage in negotiations with their clients. At the moment, given the copious amount of production, the buyers are very strong, he emphasized. \u201cSome of the producers will see a remarkable increase in gas output. For instance, the U.S., Australia, Russia and Qatar will see an outstanding surge in gas production,\u201d Birol explained.', 'Qatar\u2019s state-owned energy giant Qatar Petroleum was previously reported to increase liquefied natural gas (LNG) production capacity to 126 million tons per annum (mtpa) by 2027, an increase of 64% from the current level of 77 mtpa. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) predicts dry natural gas production in the U.S. will rise by 2.9% in 2020.', 'The rise in gas output will increase propitious circumstances for countries like Turkey, he remarked, pointing out the fact that now the energy world is talking about demand security. \u201cTurkey should and will benefit from plummeting prices as a major gas importer. The current and prospective production conditions will enable Turkey to diversify its suppliers. It has remarkably empowered the infrastructure for LNG,\u201d he said. The current low price environment will hopefully enable Turkey to increase its negotiating power for the upcoming contracts, Birol added.', 'In the last decade, the European countries have already availed the resource abundance and saved billions of dollars in their negotiations for the pipeline gas contracts.', 'Some of Turkey\u2019s long-term gas contracts will expire in 2021, and the number of gas imports stipulated in those contracts total 16 billion cubic meters, corresponding to nearly 30% of the approximately 50 billion cubic meters (bcm) of domestic gas consumption per year, according to the Energy Market Regulatory Authority (EMRA).', 'Between January and October of last year, the amount of gas imports provided to Turkey through the pipelines hit roughly 35.5 bcm, according to initial calculations based on EMRA data. LNG imports, on the other hand, slightly exceeded 10 bcm, accounting for nearly 25% of the total gas imports in the said period.', 'Plummeting prices', 'In addition to the abundant supply, gas prices have been influenced by another striking reality: the mild winter temperatures. In contrast to previous years, countries around the world have experienced the effects of mild temperatures in the winters due to climate change. Even guests in Davos were welcomed by mild weather in the Swiss Alpine town \u2013 a fact German Chancellor Angela Merkel pointed out to raise alarms against climate change in her special address Thursday.', 'The lower winter temperatures have led to a further plunge in the prices since the gas demand has depreciated. On Jan. 21, U.S. natural gas futures fell below $2 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), down 5.4% to $1.8 mmBtu to their lowest level nearly since March 2016.', 'Asian spot prices for LNG plummeted to a multi-year low Monday, pressured by a lack of demand to consume abundant supplies. Coupled with milder-than-usual winter weather and curbed demand, some contracts fell below $4 per mmbtu in the Asian markets \u2013 the lowest in the last decade. The average LNG price for March delivery into northeast Asia was estimated to be around $4 per mmBtu, down $0.60 per mmBtu from the previous week.', 'The Oslo-based energy firm Rystad Energy said in its latest Global Service Report the market fundamentals will remain loose through 2021 \u201cbefore prices tighten significantly as LNG demand growth outpaces currently sanctioned liquefaction capacity.\u201d', '\u201cOur long-term price for Europe and Asia remains unchanged. In a balanced market, prices will need to be sufficient to cover the supply costs of new LNG projects. Consequently, we forecast prices to be about $7.10 per mmBtu at TTF (on real prices) and $8.20 per mmBtu for Asia Spot LNG (on real prices) in 2030,\u201d the company explained. For Henry Hub in the U.S., the estimates for 2030 remain at $3.29 mmBtu, but the prices are expected to increase further in the post-2030 period.', 'Investment appetite for hydrocarbons', 'When asked about the investment trajectory in an environment of falling prices, Birol underscored that investment in fossil fuels will continue despite a waning appetite, yet strongly pointing out the rising trend in the renewables will also continue.', '\u201cThe increasingly emerging new technologies in wind power, electric vehicles and hydrogen have nurtured the investment appetite. But these technologies have not matured,\u201d he said, drawing a comparison with the hydrocarbon investments. Moreover, Birol also stressed that renewable investments will account for 75% of electric investments in the next five years.', 'According to the IEA\u2019s Renewables 2019, global renewable-based energy capacity is set to rise by 50% between 2019 and 2024, driven by solar photovoltaic installations in homes, buildings and across the industry, report said.', 'With regard to the energy investment outlook, the IEA said in its latest report titled World Energy Investment released in May 2019, for fossil fuel supply, the lower levels of oil spending seen since 2014 would need to taper further to ensure consistency with the Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS). \u201cHowever,\u201d the agency added, \u201cinvestment levels fall well short of what would be needed in a world of continued strong oil demand \u2013 as in the New Policies Scenario (NPS).\u201d The IEA argued that the annual investment required for 2025-2030 scenarios ask for an accelerating momentum in the total energy supply investments despite changing costs.', 'Highlighting the growing attraction of offshore oil and gas projects, the IEA stressed that companies are moving ahead with highest-value projects, many of which are in the Gulf of Mexico, Guyana, the North Sea and Brazil in addition to large LNG projects and sanctioning of gas fields in Mozambique.', '\u201cWhile 2019 marked the third consecutive year to see an increase in projects sanctioned, 2020 could see fewer project commitments but higher capex (capital expenditure) investments than 2019 levels,\u201d Rystad Energy said in its Global Service report. According to estimates by the company, 2020 will see investment projects worth $217 billion undergo the sanctioning process, including $115 billion in onshore projects and $102 billion in offshore projects. Up until now in 2020, energy investment projects worth $18 billion have received sanctioning.', '\\nSource: Daily Sabah']"

Developments in the US-China trade dispute, geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, global recession fears and US shale versus Opec cuts all exert a powerful influence on investor confidence in the oil markets.', 'The pressure cooker of the US-China trade dispute has cooled off after the phase one deal was signed, possibly avoiding further tariff hikes and trade obstacles in the near future and easing investor sentiment. If there are more signals that the negotiating teams are closer to a comprehensive and full trade agreement in the first quarter, it\u2019s reasonable to expect more support for oil prices because the gigantic economies of the US and China would get some breathing space to recover from the damage to their manufacturing and agricultural sectors. This is looking increasingly unlikely if we consider the US elections coming up in November and President Donald Trump\u2019s comments that he is not in a hurry to conclude a final trade deal with China.', 'Positive results from a boost in confidence may not set in until later in the year. Demand for crude may pick up during the course of the year because of a recovery in the manufacturing and agricultural sectors, both main drivers of demand.', 'In the last nine months of 2019, US manufacturers and hauliers suffered a sharp decline in growth which impacted demand for petroleum products like diesel. Diesel consumption fell 3.4 per cent in the period August to October 2019 on an annual basis, meaning an overall decline in demand. In addition, although the first phase of a trade deal is signed, China has not yet lifted the 5 per cent tariff on US oil imports.', 'Even China\u2019s demand for oil weakened slightly in 2019 to 9.5 per cent growth in imports versus 10.1 per cent the year before.', 'Most institutions such as Opec and the International Monetary Fund are forecasting lower demand for oil in 2020 but there is a chance for demand to pick up if the US and China seal the second deal by the end of the year and give trade relations a fresh start. The impact of the trade disputes on sentiment shouldn\u2019t be underestimated because the prevailing mood since the trade disputes started in summer 2018 has been uncertainty which in turn dampens investment and curbs risk appetite.', 'Opec deepened its supply cuts at the end of 2019, a period in which the US Shale industry reported a higher rate of bankruptcies in what appears to be an unsustainable level of growth given lower global oil prices. Already, the US market buys domestic oil products and energy imports from overseas have fallen to 11 per cent, the lowest since 1957. Conceivably, the domestic industry could satisfy 100 per cent of US oil demand within the next year, leaving US shale with the question \u201cwhat next\u201d?', 'The US is now a serious player in international oil markets and competing hotly for market share, meaning that oil prices are set to stay hemmed in by the push and pull between US shale and Opec, with the exception of geopolitical flare-ups.', 'The supply-side risk to Middle East oil continues to be a significant factor for investors ever since the flare-up of tensions between the US and Iran in early January.', 'Fears of a prolonged conflict appear to have calmed but the situation is volatile and uneasy, meaning that oil prices may spike or even slump unexpectedly depending on what happens next.', 'Looking ahead, a bright spot for prices may be waning recession fears as investors get ready for a more robust post-trade war reality. Global recession fears were behind much of oil\u2019s price weakness last year and may have a long-tail effect in the first quarter before receding further on more positive news from trade talks.', 'The upside scenario for oil prices would be a definitive resolution to the US-China trade dispute and a reduction of geopolitical tensions. The downside would be a lag between the first and second phase agreement, adding to uncertainty, and an escalation of geopolitical tensions. Investors should expect either scenario to materialise and be prepared for oil prices to react accordingly.', '\\nSource: The National']"

    "content": "['In the January 2020 update of its Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO), the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts that U.S. crude oil production will average 13.3 million barrels per day (b/d) in 2020, a 9% increase from 2019 production levels, and 13.7 million b/d in 2021, a 3% increase from 2020.', 'U.S. crude oil production growth slows because of a decline in drilling rigs during the past year. EIA expects this trend will continue through most of 2020. Despite the decline in rigs, EIA forecasts production will continue to grow as rig efficiency and well-level productivity rise, offsetting the decline in the number of rigs until drilling activity accelerates in 2021.', 'EIA\u2019s U.S. crude oil production forecast is based on the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price forecast in the January 2020 STEO, which rises from an average of $57 per barrel (b) in 2019 to an average of $59/b in 2020 and $62/b in 2021. The price forecast is highly uncertain, and any significant divergence of actual prices from the projected price path could change the pace of drilling and new well completion, which would, in turn, affect production.', 'Crude oil production in the Lower 48 states has a relatively short investment and production cycle. Changes in Lower 48 crude oil production typically follow changes in crude oil prices and rig counts with about a four- to six-month lag. Because EIA forecasts WTI prices will decline during the first half of 2020 but begin increasing in the second half of the year and into 2021, EIA forecasts U.S. crude oil production will grow slowly until the end of 2020.', 'Crude oil production in Alaska and the Federal Offshore Gulf of Mexico\u2014which collectively accounted for about 19% of U.S. total crude oil production in 2019\u2014is driven by long-term investment that is typically less sensitive to short-term price movements.', 'Once final data are available, EIA expects the data will show that Lower 48 crude oil production reached its largest annual average volume of 9.9 million b/d, and EIA expects it to increase further by an average of 1.0 million b/d in 2020 and 0.4 million b/d in 2021.', 'EIA forecasts that production from the Federal Offshore Gulf of Mexico will grow by 0.1 million b/d in 2020 to 2.0 million b/d and to remain relatively flat in 2021 because several projects expected to come online in 2021 will not start producing until late in the year and will be offset by declines from other producing fields. Alaska\u2019s crude oil production will remain relatively unchanged at about 0.5 million b/d in both 2020 and 2021.', 'The Permian region that spans western Texas and eastern New Mexico remains the most prolific crude oil production growth region in the United States. Favorable geology combined with technological improvements have contributed to the Permian region\u2019s high returns on investment and years of remaining oil production growth potential.', 'EIA forecasts that Permian crude oil production will average 5.2 million b/d in 2020, an increase of 0.8 million b/d from 2019 production levels. For 2021, the Permian region will produce an average of 5.6 million b/d. EIA forecasts that the Bakken region in North Dakota will be the second-largest growth area in 2020 and 2021, growing by about 0.1 million b/d in each year.', '\\nSource: EIA']"

This share grew because of the increasing productivity of new wells that were brought online during 2019. Since 2007, the average first full month of oil production from new wells in regions tracked by the U.S. Energy Information Administration\u2019s (EIA) Drilling Productivity Report (DPR) has increased. The growing initial production rates have helped oil production from tight formations to increase despite the slowdowns in drilling activity when oil prices fell between 2015 and 2016. Since 2017, recovering oil prices and more efficient production from new wells have helped producers cover costs of drilling, production, and the development of new technologies.', 'The average new well in each DPR region produced more oil in 2019 than wells drilled in previous years in those same regions. This trend has persisted for more than 10 consecutive years. More effective drilling techniques, including the increasing prevalence of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling, have helped to increase these initial production rates. In particular, well productivity was improved because of the injection of more proppant during the hydraulic fracturing process and the ability to drill longer horizontal components (also known as laterals) and perforate more stages.', 'Increasing well productivity has supported crude oil production even in years such as 2015, when oil prices fell and rig counts dropped. In 2016, rig counts continued to decline sharply, and total U.S. crude oil production decreased for the first time in 10 years. Fewer wells were drilled; however, those that were drilled were drilled more quickly and located in more productive areas, which led to increasing per-well production.', 'Rig counts have fluctuated throughout 2019 in all DPR regions. The aggregate rig counts declined 16% in the first 11 months of 2019. Despite the decrease in rig count, producers are capable of drilling more efficient wells faster to keep U.S. crude oil production growing.', 'Oil producers have increasingly targeted the Permian region, which spans parts of western Texas and eastern New Mexico. The geological structure in the Permian region is more complicated than in other regions, and it took producers more time to advance the drilling and completion technology in the region. However, the Permian region is larger and has more potential for oil production than other regions. Total production and production per new well have increased in the Permian region for 13 consecutive years. In the other four DPR oil regions, oil production fell from 2016 to 2017 because of low oil prices. In Eagle Ford, oil production in 2019 is still lower than its peak in 2015.', 'Source: EIA']"

The draw ran counter to both the prevailing seasonal trend and analyst expectations of a 500,000-barrel build in an S&P Global Platts survey Tuesday.', 'The EIA weekly petroleum status report was delayed to Thursday due to a Monday federal holiday.', 'Crude inventories fell to 1.1% under the five-year average for this time of year, opening the widest supply deficit to the average since March.', 'US crude supply typically begins building in mid-January as refiners idle units for seasonal maintenance, but refinery crude demand this year has remained unseasonably strong.

The Platts Midland-Cushing WTI spread has narrowed to around 60 cents/b in recent days, the weakest spread since late-October.', 'A surge in refined product demand blunted an expected gasoline build and pushed distillate stocks lower last week.', 'Total US gasoline inventories increased 1.75 million barrels to 260.03 million barrels, paring stocks to 4.6% above the five-year average from 5.5% the week prior.', 'Nationwide distillate stocks drew 1.19 million barrels to 146.04 million barrels, running counter to analyst expectations of a 1.6 million barrel build in Platts\u2019 Tuesday survey.', 'Total product supplied, a proxy for demand, was up 2.46 million b/d to 21.5 million b/d, more than 6.5% above the five-year average. The surge was led by a 1.2 million b/d uptick in distillate supplied, due in part to colder weather setting in across the Northeast last week.', 'USGC PRODUCT STOCK GLUT EXPANDS', '\\nRefined product inventories on the USGC padded a supply overhang last week as closed export and pipeline arbitrages left refiners with little choice beyond storage.', 'USGC combined low- and ultra-low sulfur diesel stocks edged 90,000 barrels lower last week to 41.42 million barrels, but were still near two-year highs and more than 10% above the five-year average.

    "title": "Oil Geopolitical Risk Is Declining, Despite US-Iran Tensions",
    "content": "['The recent Middle East confrontations between the U.S. and Iran has done little to permanently push up the price of oil. Oil prices spiked on the days when there were acts of aggression, but quickly retraced as the other side contained its response. Was this moderation in oil volatility the result of adept diplomacy, or is it a more structural reduction in geopolitical risk?', 'Oil dynamics are quickly evolving. The U.S. consumes less oil from the Persian Gulf, while countries like China are becoming an increasingly important buyer to the region. Shipping lanes have now been secured by an expanding international coalition so that the U.S. isn\u2019t the lone enforcer. Saudi Arabia infrastructure is less vulnerable to attack as it engages U.S. military and aerial protection to intercept any missiles.', 'Interference in Middle East oil is now less effective in trying to derail U.S. growth, rather, it would have more of an impact on the countries with which Iran is trying to ally.', 'U.S. Less Reliant On Oil Imports', 'The U.S. is less vulnerable to Persian Gulf oil disruption than in any time in recent history, with only 12% of its crude oil supply coming from the region. The emergence of shale production over the past decade quickly transformed the U.S. to near energy independence. This radical transition is allowing the U.S. to become a net exporter of oil.', 'Meanwhile, China is heavily reliant on Gulf oil production with over 40% of its oil imports coming from the region. The other large Asian economies such as Japan, South Korea and India are also large off-takers of the region\u2019s oil output. This is a critical dynamic as Iran looks to court a stronger relationship with countries like China.', 'The strengthening of this alliance between China and Iran was telegraphed through recent naval exercises. At the end of December, Iran\u2019s navy took part in its first joint naval drills with China and Russia. All three benefited: Iran shows it is a credible regional power, Russia helps fortify its claim to be a power broker in the region, while China showcased its global naval reach.', 'The naval exercises were conducted close to the Strait of Hormuz. The location is significant: over 20% of the world\u2019s oil is shipped through this narrow strait, making it the one of the most vulnerable choke points in the global oil supply chain.', 'Gulf Security Is A Global Concern', 'Any material interruption or blockade of the Strait of Hormuz could disrupt global growth. The U.S. naval presence in the region is there mainly to assure freedom of navigation and deter any interruptions. Over the summer, the U.S. accused Iran of attacking at least six oil vessels and, more provocatively, seizing a British-flagged oil tanker which it delayed for two months. Drone attacks on Saudi Arabian infrastructure in September were also attributed to Iran.', 'While the U.S. has been the key naval security cop in the region, the heightened aggression led them to expand the responsibility to a broader network. The U.S., under the auspices of the International Maritime Security Council (IMSC), recruited the U.K., Australia, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain and Albania to help patrol the region.', 'Japan and South Korea are also stepping up. While the two countries will cooperate with the IMSC, they will operate more independently to keep their efforts targeted. Their sensitivity is the result of the U.S. withdrawal from the U.S.-Iran nuclear deal, which many allies see as a mistake and the catalyst for the current unrest. At this point, they do not want to appear to be picking sides.', 'U.S. Protects Saudi\u2019s Assets', 'After last September\u2019s drone strike on its infrastructure, Saudi Arabia recruited the U.S. to provide protection. The U.S. bolstered security with fighter squadrons, Patriot anti-missile systems and High Altitude Area Defense. This firepower is a major deterrent to potential attacks as it not only has a high probability of neutralizing any damage but is more likely to be able to identify and hold the culprits accountable.', 'Having this in place also helped Saudi Arabia to assure investors that its oil reserves were well protected. This was essential to its Aramco IPO launch; the government\u2019s critical equity raise.', 'Where Does That Leave Iran', 'In the past, Iranian threats to choke off the Strait of Hormuz were seen as an immediate risk to U.S. economic growth. However, that\u2019s no longer the case. As the U.S. evolves to energy independence, the countries that are most reliant on Gulf oil are some of the ones with which Iran would like to align.', 'China, as already noted, is a critical oil importer and its recent inaugural display of naval cooperation with Iran and Russia is helping anoint Iran as a credible partner. Oil interruption would undermine that relationship. Therefore, Iran is quickly becoming less incentivized to weaponize oil disruption as a geopolitical tool.', 'The expanding naval security coalition in the Gulf and the sophisticated infrastructure protection in Saudi Arabia will make it harder for Iranian oil attacks to be effective as there are more eyes on the perpetrators.', 'All of that should remove some of the Middle East geopolitical risk that typically drives oil volatility. In turn, that should allow global growth and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)\u2019s supply management to be the primary catalysts for any oil price changes.', '\\nSource: Forbes']"

    "content": "['Research director Sushant Gupta said: \u201cWe expect 2020 to be a better year with India\u2019s oil products demand growing by about 220 kb/d. Almost 80% of this growth is expected to come from diesel, gasoline and LPG.', '\u201cStabilising economic growth, the impact of the government\u2019s recent stimulus package and assuming a normal monsoon season, we expect a turnaround in diesel demand growth by about 4% to 1,830 kb/d this year.', '\u201cGasoline will maintain its positive growth, up 8% to 806 kb/d in 2020 as consumers continue to shift away from diesel passenger vehicles. However, a higher oil price and uncertainty in global economic growth remain key downside risks.\u201d', 'IMO regulations to prove beneficial', '\\nGupta added: \u201cThe IMO 2020 regulation will generally be beneficial for Indian refining margins. We expect middle-distillate cracks (price versus crude) to increase, benefiting Indian refiners because of the high yields of middle-distillate production in their product slate. But refiners will have to face headwinds from weak high-sulphur fuel oil and gasoline cracks. Supported by growing domestic demand and relatively higher refining margins in 2020, we believe India will be able to maintain high utilisation rates averaging close to 103%.\u201d', 'Focus on renewables remains high in the power sector', '\\nSolar analyst Rishab Shrestha said: \u201cIndia continues to invest in renewable sources of power with a focus on affordability, security and environment. Despite the \u2018must run\u2019 status of renewable power, wind and solar projects still faced large-scale grid curtailment in 2019, owing to the ongoing financial distress of state distribution companies. This has affected the returns on renewable projects, especially in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, leading to credit downgrades.', '\u201cEven against this backdrop, the competitive price of renewables (averaging less than US$42/MWh) has led to an addition of 11 GW of renewable capacity expected in 2019 with solar contributing approximately 9 GW.', '\u201cWe expect Indian power generation to grow by 5% on the back of improved economic growth in 2020. With several plants under construction, we expect installed capacity to increase by over 15 GW, mostly coming from new renewable installations. The economics of solar projects are expected to improve as safeguard duties on modules come to an end in July 2020.\u201d', 'Slowing economy provided relief to domestic coal production, keeping market in balance in 2019', '\\nPrincipal analyst Pralabh Bhargava said: \u201cHigher rainfalls not only resulted in lower coal generation but also hindered domestic coal production. We expect domestic production to improve in 2020.', '\u201cIn addition to a decline in coal-based power generation in H2 2019, cement and steel production were also down 1.8% and 0.3%, respectively. This resulted in a decline in coal demand. We expect coal consumption to grow only 0.5% in 2019 as compared to 8.5% in 2018 but expect consumption to improve in 2020 with a growth rate of 4.4%.', '\u201cWith power generation and cement and steel production slowing, stocks of domestic coals have started to increase in India. If the economy doesn\u2019t pick up in early 2020, and power, cement and steel demand remain slow, we see a downside risk to our coal imports forecast. Currently, we are forecasting 181 Mt of thermal coal and 65 Mt of coking coal imports in 2020.\u201d', 'Gas output to grow in 2020 after upstream sector disappoints in 2019', '\\nPrincipal analyst Alay Patel said: \u201c2019 was a disappointing year as oil and gas production declined. Major reforms were introduced for licensing, but these failed to translate into successful bid rounds.', '\u201cGas production is set to rise by 9%, underpinned by deepwater projects operated by Reliance (KG-D6) and ONGC (KG-DW-98/2). Both projects are on track for a 2020 start-up \u2013 although we expect only one well to be onstream in ONGC\u2019s field.\u201d', 'LNG demand growth to depend on pace of city gas and regas infrastructure buildout', '\\nAsia Pacific Head of Markets & Transitions, Prakash Sharma said: \u201cLNG demand grew 2% year-on-year through 2019 largely due to a slowdown in Q1 2019. Overall, RLNG usage was driven by the fertiliser (+9%) and city gas (+7%) sectors, which offset decreased consumption in the industrial sector (-8%). Total gas demand growth should rebound in 2020, supported by the fertiliser and city gas sectors.', '\u201cIn 2020, additional regas capacity is vital for India to fully benefit from the low spot LNG prices. The commissioning of two new terminals, Mundra and Jaigarh, slipped into 2020. The other main addition to capacity will be the expansion of Dahej by 2.5 mmtpa, which should be completed during 2020.\u201d', '\\nSource: Wood Mackenzie']"

By using international oil contracts based on a different kind of oil, the structure of the hedge may not fully reflect Mexico\u2019s export mix dominated by Maya, which is typically cheaper than Brent.', 'SWEET OR SOUR', '\\n\u201cI would expect a divergence of prices over the long term. This pressure on Maya could move prices down faster than its hedge. This would cause a loss on the physical sale of Maya and minimal-to-possibly no benefit of the hedge,\u201d said Ryan Dusek, director at consulting firm Opportune LLP opportune.com based in Houston, who added that the trade could end up being \u201cworthless.\u201d', 'The Mexican finance ministry declined to comment on the structure of the hedge.', 'The Wall Street source said the proportion of Maya crude hedged for 2020 was significantly lower than in previous years.', 'For the 2009 deal, for example, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley hedged 305 million barrels of crude using Maya and only 25 million with Brent, data obtained by Reuters through a freedom of information request showed.', 'The Wall Street source said for 2020, Mexico had bought put options on Brent on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) at $54-$56 a barrel and hedged Maya at $42.', 'Brent is trading at around $63 a barrel while Maya\u2019s official selling price for deliveries to the U.S. Gulf Coast is about $55, according to S&P Global Platts pricing data.', 'The options give Mexico the right to sell oil at the predetermined price, so if the actual market price is lower, the options pay out and make up the difference \u2013 acting effectively as an insurance policy.', 'But if the price of Maya, a heavy sour crude, falls faster than Brent, a light sweet crude \u2013 or Maya drops and Brent rises \u2013 Mexico could miss out on oil revenues without the hedge kicking in, analysts and market sources said.', 'Mexico has had to contend with the potential divergence in Maya and Brent crude prices before but the risk is now greater as demand for heavy crudes globally is expected to slump.', 'Reuters was unable to determine whether Mexico has taken additional steps to bridge any gaps between Maya and Brent.', '\u2018HACIENDA HEDGE\u2019', '\\nMere rumors of Mexico\u2019s \u201cHacienda hedge,\u201d which gets its name from the country\u2019s finance ministry, can shift prices ahead of its anticipated deals and the government fears participants push up premiums when they suspect Mexico is about to trade.', '\u201cBanks have become much better at accumulating information about it,\u201d said Victor Gomez, a former Mexican finance ministry official involved in the hedge until 2018.', 'In part due to this, the hedge\u2019s cost has increased 10-fold in peso terms since 2001, even though the number of barrels hedged has barely changed, the data obtained from the freedom of information request showed.', 'Mexico spent the equivalent of $212 million to hedge 200 million barrels in 2001 but in 2016, hedging 212 million barrels cost $956 million. In 2017, Mexico stopped disclosing the number of barrels it has hedged.', 'Now, for the first time in at least 19 years, finance ministry officials have declined to reveal how much they\u2019re spending to protect 2020 revenue, saying the information would give speculators insight into their strategy and raise costs.', '\u201cWhat we don\u2019t want is that they identify the moments that Mexico goes to the market, because that raises the costs of the premium,\u201d Gabriel Yorio, one of the main architects of the hedge under President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who took office a year ago, told reporters this month.', 'The cost of the hedge has also risen because the peso has declined versus the U.S. dollar and because options have become more expensive since many commodity-oriented funds, which were natural counterparties to the deal, have closed.', 'Officials have also declined to say how much of the 1.73 million barrels a day it produces they\u2019re protecting, nor to what extent they\u2019re using put options or a budget stabilization fund to guarantee government revenue.', 'All they have disclosed is that the 2020 hedge guarantees an average price for Maya of $49 a barrel.', 'Since 2001, Mexico has received three payouts up until the end of last year: in 2009, 2015 and 2016, the data showed.', 'Nevertheless, those three payments were so large the finance ministry could argue it was still ahead \u2013 at least before including the cost of the 2020 program.', 'Mexico has also taken other steps to cover its tracks. In response to further questions in Reuters\u2019 records request, Mexico\u2019s transparency institute said additional information about the hedge had been sealed for five years.', 'It cited the finance ministry as saying revealing details could increase costs, affect Mexico\u2019s monetary policy and financial stability and create systemic financial risk.', '\u201cThis is part of Mexico\u2019s strategy to leave banks and oil majors in the dark about what they are buying and how much they are paying,\u201d said Gomez.', 'Asked about specifics at a news conference on Jan. 9, Mexican official Yorio highlighted the importance of the overhaul of the crude oil pricing formulas that underpin Mexico\u2019s oil exports.', 'Last year, Mexico changed the pricing formula for Maya sales to the U.S. Gulf Coast to be based 65% on U.S. West Texas Intermediate in Houston \u2013 a light sweet crude which is the most traded U.S. Gulf Coast grade \u2013 and 35% on Brent futures.', 'Before, it had been derived from West Texas Sour, Dated Brent and other grades that have become less traded markets. The formula also previously included fuel oil rich in sulphur, which has been hit by new rules requiring ships to use cleaner fuel.', 'FUND OR OPTIONS', '\\nMexican officials involved in the hedge in the past said the government may be considering increasing its use of the stabilization fund to guarantee oil prices as a supplement to financial instruments.', 'From the mid-2010s, Mexico started to lock in part of its target oil price with the fund to contain the costs of the options it buys from banks and major oil companies.', 'For example, Mexico locked in a price of $79 for its 2015 hedge, with $76.40 guaranteed by options and the remaining $2.60 backed by the fund. In 2017, the last time the ministry released such information, $4 of its $42 hedge was covered by the fund.', 'Gomez and Julio Ruiz, another former official involved in the hedge until 2018, said Mexico was expected to expand this strategy in the coming years but cautioned it would struggle to keep enough money in the fund to hedge oil exports fully.', '\u201cThey would have to accumulate a larger amount of resources in this fund,\u201d Gomez said.', 'Nevertheless, those changes would do little to ease the concerns of some who believe Mexico spends too much on the hedge, said Ruiz, adding that guaranteeing oil revenue was still necessary given the pressures on Mexico and state-owned Pemex, the world\u2019s most heavily indebted oil company.', '\u201cIn congress, many will say they don\u2019t agree with how this money is spent, and that it shouldn\u2019t be spent on the oil hedging program,\u201d Ruiz said.', '\u201cBut Mexico\u2019s finances would become a lot more volatile without it.\u201d', '\\nSource: Reuters (Reporting by Stefanie Eschenbacher in Mexico City and Devika Krishna Kumar in New York; Additional reporting by Ana Isabel Martinez and David Alire Garcia; Editing by David Gaffen, Frank Jack Daniel and David Clarke)']"

This approach also helps identify bottlenecks in operations and uncover patterns and relationships across diverse entities, says GlobalData, a leading data and analytics company.', 'GlobalData\u2019s latest thematic report, \u2018Big Data in Oil & Gas\u2019, discusses how growing dependence on data from oil and gas operations is compelling the industry to adopt big data solutions.', 'Ravindra Puranik, Oil and Gas Analyst at GlobalData, comments: \u201cThe oil and gas industry has always generated huge volumes of data daily across the value chain. However, despite being awash with money it has been poor at data management. It is only when profits drop that the industry starts to investigate how to use data to improve operational efficiency. However, this laissez-faire approach is less prevalent now. Many players, across the value chain, are taking an enterprise-wide view to data, and applying analytics to improve existing business processes and to develop new revenue streams.\u201d', 'Data management is a very complex process, particularly given that much of an oil company\u2019s upstream data is created on remote assets and often stored in disparate, disconnected infrastructure. Moreover, there is a paucity of data scientists with a working knowledge of the oil and gas industry.', 'Puranik continues: \u201cBig data in the oil and gas industry will experience incremental growth once it overcomes these barriers. The growth will be further accelerated by concerns such as falling profit and future uncertainty from renewables.', '\u201cThe oil and gas industry traditionally relied on paper-based data collection for maintaining records from daily operations. This approach has largely been digitalized now. Effective data management is essential for this approach to succeed so that companies can make better use of their data.\u201d', 'GlobalData\u2019s thematic research identifies ADNOC, BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Equinor, ExxonMobil, Gazprom, Rosneft, Repsol, Royal Dutch Shell and Woodside as among the major oil and gas players present in the big data theme.', 'Oilfield service companies, such as Schlumberger and Baker Hughes, as well as tech giants such as Microsoft and Amazon, are developing industry-specific big data solutions to help companies such as BP, Chevron and ExxonMobil in data management tasks. These solutions can be customized for different operational processes and functions as per the requirements of the oil and gas companies.', 'Puranik concludes: \u201cThe industry generates large volumes of data that require considerable time and substantial computing power to store and analyze. This can be done either by investing in data storage facilities of their own or shifting to cloud-based solutions.

They\u2019re trying to protect these assets and hold the line.\u201d', 'Early Saturday, the US Treasury Department announced that it had extended for three months a sanctions waiver to Chevron and four US oil services companies allowing them to continue to work in Venezuela with state oil company PDVSA. It also extended a waiver preventing creditors of PDVSA from taking control of US refiner Citgo as a result of missed payments on its 2020 bonds. Both waivers were extended until April 22.', 'Before the waivers were announced, sources said that administration officials had considered allowing at least the Chevron waiver to expire, in order to increase pressure on the Maduro regime after roughly a year of oil sector sanctions had failed to push him from office.', 'Some analysts claimed that Venezuela\u2019s oil output, which averaged 720,000 b/d in December, according to the latest Platts OPEC survey, could plunge below 300,000 b/d if the waiver was allowed to expire.', 'But voices for preserving a functioning oil system in Venezuela and maintaining a revenue stream for a potential, post-Maduro government won out, said Frank Verrastro, a senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies\u2019 energy and national security program.', '\u201cI think the waiver extensions are directed at preserving options,\u201d Verrastro said. \u201cForcing Chevron and service firms to leave, essentially cedes the space to Russia and to a lesser extent, China. It also doesn\u2019t preclude further sanctions, so the waiver extension was not a surprise.\u201d', 'The extensions allow the US to maintain a presence, at least through international oil companies, in Venezuela, and prevent assets from transferring to Russian and Chinese companies, said Paul Sheldon, S&P Global Platts Analytics\u2019 chief geopolitical adviser. \u201cBut with the 2020 election approaching, and no movement toward regime change, political pressure to ramp up sanctions will rise.\u201d', '\\nROSNEFT SANCTIONS', 'The extensions, at least for the moment, seemed to dampen the prospects of additional sanctions, such as potential actions against Russian state oil company Rosneft, which continues to receive Venezuelan crude as debt repayment and then resells it to China and India buyers.', 'Asked about potential sanctions on Rosneft during a visit in Colombia Monday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declined to comment specifically, but indicated that further sanctions were coming.', '\u201cWe don\u2019t talk about particular sanctions, but everyone can fully expect that the United States is not done,\u201d he said.', 'A senior Trump administration official told Platts in August that the US was prepared to sanction Rosneft if it continued to trade crude oil and fuel with PDVSA, but analysts said those sanctions have yet to be imposed because of the expected impact they may have on the global oil market.', '\u201cIt\u2019s complicated to go after an economically significant target like Rosneft,\u201d said Kevin Book, managing director with ClearView Energy Partners.', 'Book said instead of broad sanctions, which could impact multinational banks and energy companies, the US may instead target a Rosneft subsidiary or affiliate.', '\u201cDoing this in a way that could potentially stop Rosneft from moving cargoes out of Venezuela without inhibiting commercially important operations for IOCs would be very difficult, but not impossible,\u201d Book said.', '\\nSource: ', '\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t']"

    "content": "['The death of Iranian commander Qasim Suleimani on January 3rd in an American drone strike has roiled Iran and Iraq. It has also jeopardized the future of Iraq\u2019s oil production growth. ', 'Heightened security risks in the wake of Suleimani\u2019s death could persuade the international oil companies active in Iraq \u2014 like Exxon Mobil or BP \u2014 that investing in infrastructure projects that are key to Iraq\u2019s oil production ambitions isn\u2019t worth it. Iraq\u2019s fiscal terms were already viewed as notoriously tough inside the oil industry, and routine maintenance at the country\u2019s aging oil fields is only getting harder. Now, greater odds that Iran will lash out through its powerful militia proxies in Iraq to stoke unrest could be the last straw.', 'On top of that, the prospect of a withdrawal of US troops raises the stakes. Iraq\u2019s parliament voted shortly after the drone strike to expel US troops, calling the attack a violation of their sovereignty since it happened on Iraqi soil. A withdrawal remains highly questionable, since many Sunni and Kurdish members of parliament didn\u2019t participate in the vote and US president Donald Trump has threatened sanctions if Iraq follows through. Still, it means that Iranian counter-measures might enjoy greater impunity. It also increases the odds of a resurgence of Islamic State militants in areas where oil drilling or refining is done. ', 'None of this is to oil companies\u2019 liking. As they survey an imperilled Iraq, they might step back from crucial investments in infrastructure like the Common Seawater Supply Project (CSSP), a multi-billion dollar scheme to extract more crude oil from aging fields by pumping seawater into them. Experts say the CSSP is vital to Iraq\u2019s plans to lift oil production above the current 4.5 million barrels per day. But now oil companies might be asking themselves: is it worth it? ', 'According to Paul Stevens at Chatham House, \u201cIt is now very unlikely that the crucial \u2018common seawater supply project\u2019 being run by Exxon \u2013 essential for expanding production capacity \u2013 will go ahead in the near future.\u201d', 'Looking to Iraq', 'In the wake of Suleimani\u2019s death, analysts raised and then quickly dismissed the possibility that Iran might close the Strait of Hormuz, a pivotal chokepoint for the passage of oil tankers, or perhaps intensify its proxy campaigns in Yemen or Lebanon. Those options risk inviting a military response from the US or allies like Saudi Arabia or Israel, although many believe Iran could still carry out attacks against individual oil products tankers in the Strait of Hormuz, echoing tactics that foreign intelligence say it undertook last year. ', 'Instead, all eyes have turned to Iraq. For Tehran, provocation in Iraq is the most feasible way to intensify a proxy campaign against the US. Iran\u2019s foreign minister said it had \u201cconcluded\u201d its retaliation against the US after firing missiles at a US airbase in Iraq, but experts are unconvinced, saying indirect counter-measures are likely. \u201cIraq is the most cost-effective strategy to expand control and continue its \u2018shadow war\u2019 with the US given its intelligence footprint and political assets,\u201d according to Ahmad Mehdi of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies (OIES) earlier this week. \u201cTehran has every interest to whip up anti-US sentiment and further de-legitimise the protest movement in a bid to strengthen its hand.\u201d ', 'Iran doesn\u2019t have to take any additional actions to damage Iraq\u2019s future oil production. The mere prospect of them has already proved damaging, since it dampens investors\u2019 enthusiasm. ', '\u201cIn the medium term, heightened security concerns might make it more difficult for Iraq to build production capacity,\u201d the International Energy Agency (IEA) said this week, becoming the most influential of several groups saying much the same. Rystad Energy\u2019s Matthew Fitzsimmons noted that \u201cany spending plans in Iraq are likely to be under review given the current circumstances.\u201d And Paul Stevens, in a commentary for Chatham House, wrote that \u201cIraq\u2019s future production has already been damaged as international oil companies are withdrawing staff for safety reasons\u201d \u2014 with worse to come. ', 'No country wants to hear that foreign investors are losing interest. Iraq may be especially displeased. Its oil production of around 4.5 million barrels a day will soon hit a ceiling of around 5 million barrels a day, with more growth achievable only by installing big-budget infrastructure projects that center on pipeline capacity and water injection into oil fields to boost reservoir pressure. ', 'There are some interim steps that Iraq could take, such as increasing the use of industrial water and water recycling, or expanding capacity at something called the Qarmat Ali Water Treatment facility, according to Ahmad Mehdi of OIES. But neither is a substitute for the big projects that Iraq really needs. ', 'Several months before the January 3rd drone strike, the International Energy Agency (IEA) had already revised down its forecast for future Iraqi oil production, from 7.5 down to 6 million barrels per day by 2030. The heightened security risks and Iraq\u2019s increased anti-American may well force the IEA to push that forecast down further. ', '\u201cIraq\u2019s long-term supply outlook may need to be revised,\u201d according to Mehdi. ', 'How a stalled \u201cmegaproject\u201d illustrates Iraq\u2019s oil growth dilemma', 'How do you pipe millions of barrels of seawater a day across the arid plains of southern Iraq and down into massive underground oil reservoirs hundreds of miles away? It is a question for engineers that has fallen to bureaucrats and oil executives. ', 'In 2009 Iraq hatched plans to build what would become known as the Common Seawater Supply Project (CSSP), a \u201cmegaproject\u201d that aims to inject seawater into the country\u2019s oil fields in order to force out more crude oil. At the time, Iraq had high hopes for its oil sector, seeking to raise production to 12 million barrels per day by 2018. At that level of output, Iraq would have nearly overtaken the US and Saudi Arabia\u2019s as the world\u2019s largest oil producer. ', 'The delays began almost immediately. Awarded to Exxon Mobil in 2010, the following year Iraq suspended the project contract after Exxon signed an oil extraction deal with Iraq\u2019s Kurdish rivals to the north. The contract then went to Iraq\u2019s state-owned South Oil Company, which began studying where to lay pipelines and build water treatment facilities, but little has come of the plans. Exxon Mobil reportedly re-entered the project in 2015, but progress has remained scant. By late 2015, the time of a Wall Street Journal account of the CSSP\u2019s history to date, the scheme was seven years behind schedule and expected to be finished by 2020 at the earliest. By all accounts, it still has not limped out of the planning stage. ', 'Disputes over the commercial terms of the CSSP lie at the heart of it glacial progress. For international oil companies like Exxon Mobil or BP, which operates Iraq\u2019s largest field, Rumaila, Iraq has long been a notoriously low-reward investment environment. Companies flocked to Iraq in the 2000s, eager to grab a piece of Iraq\u2019s relatively untapped oil fields, and in exchange they accepted low \u201cper-barrel remuneration fees.\u201d But as the fields surrendered more of their crude, that thinking began to change, and oil companies have started pushing back. One company \u2014 Shell \u2014 already decamped in mid-2018, while others are reportedly jumpy. ', 'Concerns over corruption have become more central. In July, OilPrice.com published lengthy comments from a \u201csenior oil and gas industry\u201d source who suggested that Exxon was worried it would need to strain just to do things legally. \u201cA lot of what needs to happen in order to make this project [CSSP] progress properly will be in the hands of people who are less concerned about it working than about what they can personally pocket to allow it to occur,\u201d the source said. Transparency International ranks Iraq 169th out of 180 countries in its index of perceived corruption. ', 'Other reasons Iraq might struggle to hold onto its investors have little to do with Iraq itself. After the price crash of 2014, oil companies got lean. They brought costs down and honed their skills on the shale fields of the US. In doing so, they eroded Iraq\u2019s comparative advantage, which is the inexpensive nature of its low-lying crude reserves. All the while, new drilling opportunities were opening up elsewhere. An expanding frontier of shale oil drilling opportunities in the US beckons investors with short life-cycle projects, while massive new discoveries in places like Guyana have satiated much demand for new oil sources. Now, investors are returning to places like Angola as it and other producers bow to a new era of lower oil prices by relaxing their fiscal terms. ', 'As the world\u2019s sixth largest crude oil producer by daily volume, Iraq retains great influence in the energy world. Increasingly, it may need to make do.', '\\nSource: Forbes']"

    "content": "['Oil prices are unlikely to sustain any significant gains this year despite escalating tensions in the Middle East, according to the chief of one of the world\u2019s leading providers of information to the commodities and energy markets.', 'With the attack on Saudi Arabia\u2019s Abqaiq oil facilities in September or the US drone strike that killed Iran\u2019s top General Qassem Suleimani in Baghdad this month \u201cthe markets did react but the reaction was short-lived because the realisation is fairly quick that there is supply which can come,\u201d said Martin Fraenkel, S&P Global Platts president.', '\u201cI don\u2019t think markets are complacent. They are realistic about the nature of the disruption we have seen so far,\u201d he told The National in Davos, where he is attending the World Economic Forum annual meeting. \u201cThe obvious key reason has been the massive growth in US production of crude and that continues to grow, albeit at a slower rate. If supply is disrupted for short periods of time like we\u2019ve seen then there are either stocks or other supply available to meet it.\u201d', 'Producers both within and outside of Opec also have some spare capacity to meet any shortfall.', '\u201cThe vulnerability of oil markets to supply disruptions really depends significantly on what the overall supply and demand context is,\u201d Mr Fraenkel said. \u201cWe see stocks of oil around the world as being reasonable and some of the key consuming countries like China have restocked over the last few years.\u201d', 'Markets are looking past supply-side risks. The clearest example of that is benchmark Brent crude increasing past $66 a barrel following the disruption in Libya which took more than a million barrels a day from the market temporarily, reducing the Opec producer\u2019s output to its lowest since 2011. On Tuesday Brent fell to $64.84 a barrel as global supplies eased concerns and Europe said it is considering dispatching a military force to Libya.', 'In December, S&P Global Platts projected Brent to break above $65 a barrel between March and May before falling back to the low $60s a barrel by year-end. This is based on forecasts of global oil demand growth rising to 1.26 million barrels per day this year, up from 0.95m bpd last year.', '\u201cWe see supply of oil as being pretty reasonable relative to demand. We see 2020 as being a broadly balanced market,\u201d said Mr Fraenkel, who before joining S&P Global Platts had been with futures and options exchange owner CME Group.', 'Things could change, he said, if there was prolonged disruption, which fundamentally altered the supply balances in one of the bigger producers.', 'The September attack on Saudi Arabia \u201cwas probably the most serious geopolitical incident we have seen,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the past, that would have been massive for months and years but actually the Saudis were able to reinstate production pretty quickly. The market sentiment was that this is a one off rather than something long-term.\u201d', 'More broadly, compared to 20 years ago there is less dependency on Middle Eastern oil relative to the proportion of the overall oil supply and demand balance, Mr Fraenkel said.', 'This could mean that the kind of price shocks witnessed in the past may not be as much of a factor today. World Economic Forum research last week showed that the fear of an oil price shock and its impact on the global economy is not as pronounced among leading executives as it was several years ago.', '\u201cNot always but generally, the shocks come from the Middle East. It\u2019s not just the Middle East but it was obviously the most geopolitically charged part of the global energy markets and was a very significant part of production,\u201d he said. \u201cEven a few years ago we had very tight supply and demand imbalance. At the moment that\u2019s not the case. Even if we were to have a sustained supply shock which took global crude prices high, for example, we are all pretty confident that in the US the ability to produce more shale oil at higher prices is there.\u201d', 'The US Energy Information Administration expects output to reach record levels this year and next. Rising production in the US could limit price increases, said Mr Fraenkel, who was also a senior commodities trader at several investment banks.', '\u201cWhat happened when we had the disruption in Saudi \u2026 crude prices rallied towards $70 a barrel \u2026 all the producers in the Permian basin and around, they\u2019re all hedging and selling forward there and capping the price rise \u2026 they can produce very economically for the next year to eighteen months based on those hedges. We see quite a lot of outstanding options which are struck at $70 a barrel and that\u2019s seems to us a natural resistance point.\u201d', 'On Monday, the International Monetary Fund said it forecasts oil prices at $58 a barrel but expects this figure to be higher in its October forecast later this year.', '\u201cClearly we have seen a rise in geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. We still have to see how far this goes. If you look at the response of markets and if you look at oil prices the reaction has been fairly muted at this point,\u201d Gita Gopinath, the IMF\u2019s chief economist said at the World Economic Forum in Davos. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen some increase of about $3-$4 [a barrel] in the price of oil but nothing very large. Again it\u2019s going to depend on what shape the geopolitical conflict takes.\u201d', '\\nSource: The National']"

    "content": "['In 2019, many central banks in both developed economies and emerging markets reversed the trends of their monetary policies to be more accommodative. The market turmoil experienced at the end of 2018 and the uncertainties related to the trade dispute between China and the US resulted in some deceleration in economic activities and hence called for more supportive monetary policies. The US Federal Reserve cut its main policy rate by 0.75 percentage points (pp) in 2H19. This was in sharp contrast to Fed policymakers\u2019 expectations of a 0.5 pp rise in 2019 at the end of 2018 (Graph 1). With the Fed\u2019s employment and price objectives met, and considering the expectation of a trade agreement, Fed officials anticipate interest rates to remain steady in 2020.', 'Graph 1: Key policy rates in advanced economies', 'Similarly, other central banks of major developed economies also reversed course. The European Central Bank (ECB), which had stopped its quantitative easing programme at the end of 2018, restarted in November 2019 with \u20ac20 bn in monthly asset purchases \u2013 with no clear finish line \u2013 and cut its deposit rate by 10 basis points to -0.5%. This also ran in contrast to the expectation of a potential rate hike at the end of 2019. The sharp deceleration in the Euro-zone, including persistently below-target inflation readings, has resulted in expectations that interest rates will remain at current levels for the foreseeable future. In Japan, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) has maintained course, extending its asset purchase programme while keeping rates steady. In spite of the continued support by the BoJ inflation readings of close to zero have spurred discussion about the feasibility of reaching its 2% target in a sustainable way.', 'Graph 2: Key policy rates in BRIC countries', 'The Fed\u2019s shift to a more accommodative stance gave room for many emerging market central banks to ease monetary policy. Some emerging markets that had experienced significant pressure on their currencies a year earlier reduced interest rates significantly (Graph 2). The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) cut its main policy rate five times \u2013 by 1.35 pp in total \u2013 amid a significant drop in core inflation readings and deceleration of economic growth. However, the transmission of those cuts to borrowers continues to be limited. In the case of China, the People\u2019s Bank of China (PBoC) reduced the ratio of required reserves (RRR) twice to spur lending, while in January 2020, it has added an additional RRR cut as pressure on the yuan dropped. In Brazil, the Central Bank cut interest rates by 2.0 pp, while Russia cut rates by 1.5 pp, supporting the recoveries in these two economies. The Fed\u2019s monetary easing helped to weaken the dollar in 1H19, while EM currencies were particularly sensitive to trade-related developments \u2013 two forces that resulted in large swings in risk appetite.', 'The low interest rate environment is likely to support economic growth expected at 3.1% in 2020. Moreover, some additional support could possibly come from countries with ample fiscal space, taking the opportunity to borrow at very low rates \u2013 or sometimes negative rates \u2013 to finance infrastructure projects, which is expected to support the demand for oil. Similarly, the continued accommodative monetary policies, coupled with an improvement in financial markets, could provide further support to ongoing increases in non-OPEC supply. Therefore, the collaboration between OPEC and non-OPEC producing countries participating in the \u2018Declaration of Cooperation\u2019 remains essential in maintaining stability in the oil market.', '\\nSource: OPEC']"

Mergers and acquisitions have been brisk, operators are drilling more and have sanctioned a number of stand-alone facilities for the first time in some years.', 'As a further signal of the US Gulf\u2019s promise, Chevron \u2013 in a much-awaited December move \u2013 gave the green light to development of its Anchor discovery, potentially opening up a new play in the region.', 'But despite the region\u2019s promise and quickening pace of activity, analysts caution that it is unlikely to see comparable activity levels to those of early in the last decade \u2013 at least not yet.', '\u201cWe are still in a period of recovery\u201d from an industry downturn that began in early 2015, Sami Yahya, analyst for S&P Global Platts Analytics, said. \u201cOperators are not putting their feet on the gas pedal all the way.\u201d', 'One big uncertainty is cost, which blew through the roof during the last regional activity peak six or seven years ago, but were tamped down by low demand when oil prices fell about 50% from over $100/b between the middle of 2014 and the year\u2019s end.', 'But costs may not rise that much this year, William Turner, vice president-Gulf of Mexico for consultants Welligence Energy Analytics, said.', '\\n2019 LIKELY BOTTOM FOR OILFIELD COSTS', '\u201cThe year 2019 will probably mark the bottom of costs for third-party contractors, rig rates and oilfield services,\u201d Turner said. \u201cSo those moving forward are betting that now is the best time to be lining up the work because prices will only go up from here.\u201d', 'The relatively low oilfield costs seen at the present stem from concessions made to exploration and production companies to help them stay afloat during the 2015-2017 industry downturn. Turner and others believe costs will rise some this year as demand picks up from more US Gulf activity.', 'In part as a result of lower oilfield prices and also from efficiencies, US Gulf oil breakevens average around $45/b, with a lower average for tiebacks. These are quick field hookups to existing infrastructure and do not require massive and long lead-time construction.', 'Gulf crudes currently priced around $60/b leave a comfortable margin for operators that survived the downturn and are now beefing up their Gulf operations.', 'Talos Energy, for example, in December made what it called a \u201ctransformative\u201d purchase of US Gulf prospects, finds and production from several small operators. Also in December, W&T Offshore, a US Gulf-focused producer, bought ConocoPhillips\u2019 last operated producing asset in the region after the latter exited US Gulf exploration in 2015.', 'Hess recently drilled its first US Gulf exploratory well in years at Esox, unveiling a discovery in October.

But 20,000 psi development requires subsea equipment rated to withstand more punishing pressures. Until recently the technology was not available.', 'Once Anchor is online in 2024, it could spur not only further exploration of those extreme wells, but development of discoveries made years ago but kept on ice for lack of production technology. These include BP\u2019s Tiber and Kaskida discoveries, which were announced in 2009 and 2006, respectively.', 'LLOG recently ordered subsea trees for Shenandoah, also a 20,000 psi project 200 miles south of New Orleans, containing 100-400 million barrels of oil, while Total is in the early stages of advancing another 20,000 psi project, North Platte.', 'In addition, the cost of newbuild facilities has dropped drastically. Better supply chain logistics, re-using hub designs in lieu of designing uniquely for each field, and sizing hubs for nearer-term output rather than the long-term, are greatly slashing construction costs in an era of corporate austerity.', 'The payoff has been that in the last couple of years, new production facilities have been given the green light by Shell and BP in the form of Vito, which has a breakeven cost under $35/b, and Mad Dog Phase 2, respectively.', '\u201cThe industry will be watching the performance of the upcoming standalone projects and that could have an impact on how other projects tread forward,\u201d Yahya said.', '\\nSource: ', '\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t']"

    "title": "Is The Upstream Sector Spending Enough?",
    "content": "['Upstream spend on development and exploration is a barometer of the industry\u2019s mood. Here\u2019s the view of our upstream team, led by Fraser McKay, Head of Upstream Analysis, Dr Andrew Latham, Head of Exploration, and Rob Clarke, Director US L48. ', 'What do we think global spend will be in 2020? We expect development expenditure of around U.S.$450 billion this year. That\u2019s about 8% above the 2016 low, but flat year-on-year and 40% below the peak of 2014.', 'Is the industry spending enough? That\u2019s the big question on our minds. Companies are still extremely cautious, with capital discipline the order of the day. Budgets are tightly controlled, though service sector costs are still low so there\u2019s more bang for buck. Despite the fall in spend, supply of oil and gas has continued to surprise on the upside. Whether that holds true into the mid-2020s depends on whether Permian tight oil delivers the growth we expect.', 'Where are the opportunities? Development outside the U.S. Lower 48 is robust, up around 4% to U.S.$352 billion this year. We predict a healthy crop of conventional final investment decisions (FIDs) of around 40 projects; below the 2018 peak of 54, but up on last year and the second-highest since the downturn. These hold 34 billon barrels of oil equivalent (boe) of resource with total spend of U.S.$220 billion, in line with the 2018 high-water mark. The average project size at over 800 million boe is also a bit higher.', 'Which segments are growing? Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is seeing a major growth spurt. The market is heavily oversupplied at present, but the industry needs to develop new LNG supply to meet growing demand. Last year saw a record 71 million tonnes per annum of new capacity sanctioned, including December\u2019s go-ahead for Nigeria LNG Train 7. 2020 could match that number with big projects in Qatar, the US and Mozambique. Spend on upstream LNG projects in 2020 will be up 50% on 2019 to over U.S.$30 billion (excluding non-integrated plant spend). There\u2019s a concern about cost pressures after the squeeze early last decade, when new build was concentrated on Australia. This time, there\u2019s a wider geographical spread and spare capacity in fabrication yards.', 'And going backwards? US unconventionals \u2013 spend will fall by more than 10% in 2020, with tight oil and shale gas both down. There\u2019s still plenty of tight oil inventory with breakevens below US$50/bbl, mainly in the Permian. But investors have tired of years of negative cash flow and \u201cjam tomorrow\u201d. Many of the independents that dominate tight oil production are being forced to reduce spend and, instead of pursuing growth, deliver free cash flow and dividends. The Majors, led by ExxonMobil and Chevron, don\u2019t have the same constraints and will increase spend.', 'The net effect is lower spend and lower average rig count. This will lead to monthly year-on-year tight oil production growth falling to virtually zero by the end of this year, albeit temporarily. It\u2019s a far cry from the rampant growth of the last few years. With Henry Hub depressed, cash flow for unconventional gas players is also under pressure and spend will decline.', 'Is exploration spend increasing as returns improve? No, the opposite. We expect a drop of 15%, to around U.S.$30 billion, meaning spend in 2020 will be just one-third of the U.S.$93 billion 2014 peak. The continued drop in spend comes despite improved exploration economics \u2013 we expect full cycle returns of 12% to 15% in 2020, the fourth straight year of value creation.', 'Conventional exploration is inherently high risk and vulnerable when capital is constrained. Fewer companies are exploring, with smaller explorers struggling to raise risk capital. Another reason spend is declining in 2020 is that well commitments have fallen away. We aren\u2019t yet seeing companies rein in exploration directly because of risks posed by the energy transition, though that will come. We reckon U.S.$25 billion to U.S.$30 billion may be the new normal for undisturbed global exploration spend for the next few years.', 'Will the current spike in oil price change anything? Unlikely. The geopolitical tensions behind the January jump in Brent increase uncertainty and, if anything, weaken the case for discretionary investment. The industry has a reputation for short-termism but, in 2020, will be at pains to convince investors it won\u2019t fall into the trap of loosening capital discipline. Any surplus cash flow generated by higher prices will most likely be returned to shareholders as buy-backs or used to pay down debt.', '\\nSource: Wood Mackenzie']"

    "title": "IEA International Energy Agency : Oil and gas industry needs to step up climate efforts now",
    "content": "['Oil and gas companies are facing a critical challenge as the world increasingly shifts towards clean energy transitions. Fossil fuels drive the companies\u2019 near-term returns, but failure to address growing calls to reduce greenhouse gas emissions could threaten their long-term social acceptability and profitability.', 'The oil and gas industry now needs to make clear what clean energy transitions mean for it \u2013 and what it can do to accelerate clean energy transitions.', 'Whatever path the world follows in its efforts to limit the rise in global temperatures, intensifying climate impacts will increase the pressure on all industries to find solutions. While some oil and gas companies have taken steps to support efforts to combat climate change, the industry as a whole could play a much more significant role through its engineering capabilities, financial resources and project-management expertise, according to the IEA\u2019s Oil and Gas Industry in Energy Transitions report, which was released today.', '\u2018No energy company will be unaffected by clean energy transitions,\u2019 said Dr Fatih Birol. \u2018Every part of the industry needs to consider how to respond. Doing nothing is simply not an option.\u2019', 'The landscape of the oil and gas industry is diverse, meaning there is no single strategic response but a variety of approaches depending on each company\u2019s circumstances.', '\u2018The first immediate task for all parts of the industry is reducing the environmental footprint of their own operations,\u2019 Dr Birol said. \u2018As of today, around 15% of global energy-related greenhouse gas emissions come from the process of getting oil and gas out of the ground and to consumers. A large part of these emissions can be brought down relatively quickly and easily.\u2019', 'Reducing methane leaks to the atmosphere is the single most important and cost-effective way for the industry to bring down these emissions. But there are ample other opportunities to lower the emissions intensity of delivered oil and gas by eliminating routine flaring and integrating renewables and low-carbon electricity into new upstream and LNG developments.', '\u2018Also, with their extensive know-how and deep pockets, oil and gas companies can play a crucial role in accelerating deployment of key renewable options such as offshore wind, while also enabling some key capital-intensive clean energy technologies \u2013 such as carbon capture, utilisation and storage and hydrogen \u2013 to reach maturity,\u2019 Dr Birol added. \u2018Without the industry\u2019s input, these technologies may simply not achieve the scale needed for them to move the dial on emissions.\u2019', 'Some oil and gas companies are diversifying their energy operations to include renewables and other low-carbon technologies. However, average investment by oil and gas companies in non-core areas has so far been limited to around 1% of total capital spending, with the largest outlays going to solar PV and wind. Some oil and gas companies have also diversified by acquiring existing non-core businesses \u2013 for example in electricity distribution, electric-vehicle charging, and batteries \u2013 while stepping up research and development activity. But overall, there are few signs of the large-scale change in capital allocation needed to put the world on a more sustainable path.', 'An essential task is to step up investment in the fuels \u2013 such as hydrogen, biomethane and advanced biofuels \u2013 that can deliver the energy system benefits of oil and gas without net carbon emissions. Within 10 years, these low-carbon fuels would need to account for around 15% of overall investment in fuel supply if the world is to get on course to tackle climate change. In the absence of low-carbon fuels, transitions become much harder and more expensive.', '\u2018The scale of the climate challenge requires a broad coalition encompassing governments, investors, companies and everyone else who is genuinely committed to reducing emissions,\u2019 said Dr Birol. \u2018That effort requires the oil and gas industry to be firmly and fully on board.\u2019', 'Low-carbon electricity will undoubtedly move to centre stage in the future energy mix. But investment in oil and gas projects will still be needed, even in rapid clean energy transitions. If investment in existing oil and gas fields were to stop completely, the decline in output would be around 8% per year. This is larger than any plausible fall in global demand, so investment in existing fields and some new ones remains part of the picture.', 'In some cases, company owners may favour sticking with a specialisation in oil and gas \u2013 possibly shifting more towards natural gas over time \u2013 for as long as these fuels are in demand and investment returns are sufficient. But these companies will also need to think through their strategic response to new and pervasive challenges. The stakes are particularly high for national oil companies charged with the stewardship of countries\u2019 hydrocarbon resources \u2013 and for their government owners and host societies that typically rely heavily on the associated oil income.', 'National oil companies account for well over half of global production and an even larger share of reserves. Some are high performing, but many are poorly positioned to adapt to changing global energy dynamics. Global energy trends have prompted a number of countries to renew their commitment to reform and to diversify their economies, and fundamental changes to development models in many major resource holders look unavoidable. National oil companies can provide important elements of stability for economies during this process, if they are operating effectively and alert to the risks and opportunities.', 'This report was produced in cooperation with the World Economic Forum (WEF). It will be presented to government and industry leaders during the WEF\u2019s Annual Meeting in Davos on January 21.', '\\nSource: IEA \u2013 International Energy Agency']"

    "content": "['The phase 1 trade deal with China has been signed at the White House and includes the Chinese promise to \u2018strive\u2019 to import $50 billion worth of oil and natural gas from the U.S. this year and next. Although that sounds wonderful, the truth, while positive, is somewhat less beneficial for the industry.', 'First, it must be acknowledged that U.S. oil and gas exports (the later liquified natural gas) have dropped sharply since the trade war began in 2018, as the figure below shows. Revenue had peaked out at something like $1.5 billion per month, or about $18 billion per year, close to what China is promising for this year, implying the target should be easy to reach. Next year\u2019s target of $34 billion is much more ambitious, at least on paper. (See the second figure.)', 'First, it is worth noting that only a minor part of U.S. crude oil and petroleum product exports have gone to China, as the next figure shows. The loss of China as a market had little impact on the U.S. oil industry or the world price, although sophisticated econometric analysis or modeling might detect some losses on the margin. After all, any interference in the free market typically imposes costs on producers and/or consumers.', 'And, as American philosopher Dogbert noted years ago, oil is fungible: Chinese oil purchases were switched to other producers, U.S. oil sales went elsewhere, and the overall costs were relatively small. China could easily meet the 2021 target for energy purchases from the U.S. by buying one million barrels per day, which is about triple the earlier peak, but still only about 10% of their total oil imports. The oil China doesn\u2019t buy from other sellers would simply go elsewhere and the market impact would be minimal. (Maybe extra tanker usage.)', 'At first blush, the same story holds for U.S. LNG exports: China made up a small but growing market for U.S. exporters, and the loss of the market did not reduce overall export levels. At least in theory. The reality, however, is that U.S. LNG exporters are more interested in the potential sales which are enormous: China accounted for 50.5% of world coal consumption in 2018, an enormous source of greenhouse gas emissions, to say nothing of local and regional pollution. Increasing imports of LNG would have many benefits locally, nationally, and globally. The U.S. LNG export industry would be doing well by doing good.', 'But while the Chinese government is working to increase gas consumption and reduce coal usage, price matters. (I\u2019m considering having that tattooed on my forehead, but I can\u2019t decide the appropriate font.) And this is where the trade war comes in: the Chinese have put a 25% import tariff on U.S. LNG purchases, which makes it more difficult to compete with both other exporters and Chinese coal. Removing the tariffs would mean more displacement of coal consumption as well as higher sales for U.S. exporters. Unlike oil, LNG is not perfectly fungible because a lack of specialized unloading and regasification equipment restricts sellers\u2019 ability to switch supplies between buyers.', 'Without a removal of the Chinese tariffs on LNG imports, the U.S. petroleum industry will not receive major new sales to that market, much of which could be incremental to global consumption, not displacing of other imports. This should provide a very clear target for U.S. negotiators, and hopefully the Chinese government will recognize the value to itself and its people of removing these tariffs.', '\\nSource: Forbes']"

    "content": "['Expect low and lower prices for oil and natural gas during Election 2020. Since long before he was elected, President Trump consistently called for lower oil prices, and he has strived to maintain low oil prices with his Middle East policies. The third rail of energy policy for every elected official in Washington D.C. is that no one is re-elected if prices increase at the pump or the electricity meter. Not Republicans. Not Democrats. This is why there is no national carbon pricing mechanism and no leadership from Washington to address climate change, even though a majority of all voters favor biting the bullet and paying for action to reduce carbon emissions in the US.', 'With this landscape in place, the one positive federal action that would benefit industry, consumers and the environment would be the construction and completion of natural gas pipelines to New England. That could buy votes for both Republicans and Democrats this year.', 'Notwithstanding the political climate, last year\u2019s forecast for 2019 in these pages played out as expected. OPEC+ Russia proved to be unreliable, (once again) reneging on their promise to maintain higher oil prices and instead kept prices low as President Trump demanded. Wall Street investors forced a number of mergers and reorganizations. The Wall Street Journal exposed the dirty secret of US shale operators: \u201cchild\u201d wells in the shale plays do not perform as well as the initial or parent well. Further research confirmed the findings and, in fact, demonstrated that the \u201cchild\u201d wells are 30% to 40% less productive than predicted by operators in 2018. The rig count is down. Some operators kindly postponed layoffs until after the holidays. But the inventory of Drilled Uncompleted wells, the DUCs, finally began to diminish as operators took massive write-downs on their sunk drilling costs. The last of the write-downs should be realized with the 2019 yearend reports.', 'The natural gas industry also suffered from low prices, as the associated production of gas in the Permian drew negative (!) prices, as low as -$8/mcf, or thousand cubic feet, as supply overwhelmed capacity to take the gas to market.', 'That the Permian Basin flares more gas than many states consume is a problem for industry, consumer and environment. Chesapeake issued a going concern warning. Chevron wrote down billions relating to its natural gas assets\u2014not because the production of the gas is noneconomic at current prices but that the horizon for bringing that gas to market is now indefinite. The pipeline projects planned in 2010 to take gas from West Virginia and Pennsylvania to New England are no closer to construction. As a consequence, the residents of Boston pay more than $8/mcf for natural gas delivered as LNG vs. customers just 400 miles away, who pay less than $3/mcf. That every oil-burning house in New England belches at least 30% more CO2 with $60 oil than it would with the $18 heating equivalent amount of natural gas is ludicrous by any measure.', 'The first week of 2020 began with a display of exactly how dependent the US oil markets are upon the Middle East. Even though President Trump declared that the US is energy independent, consumers who purchase fuel at the pump every day know better. US oil production is up to 12+ million barrels per day. Some will point out that production of NGLs, natural gas liquids, are up to 6 million barrels per day and call that \u201cpetroleum production\u201d to match the approximately 18 million barrels per day of US oil consumption. But they dissemble by mixing apples and oranges. NGLs are not refined into transportation fuels in the US.', 'Of the US oil production of 12+ million barrels per day, fully 4 million barrels are exported because US refineries are not configured to process the lighter grade of crude produced here. The US still requires imported oil to fuel our transportation infrastructure. And of course, with the recent ability to export crude, US consumers could find themselves bidding for US-produced oil against China or Japan in the event of catastrophe in the Middle East.', 'The exposure to lower oil prices continues. US domestic production is just 12% of the daily world market of 100 million barrels per day. Only 4 million barrels per day of US production could compete on price with members of OPEC in another all-out predatory price war such as the one experienced in 2015 and 2016.', 'Eventually, the newly publicly-held Saudi Aramco will go for market share, so US shale plays must improve productivity and reduce costs. Some of these shale plays will likely go into a form of suspended animation, much the way the Barnett Shale has for gas. For years, the granddaddy of horizontal fracking natural gas plays has had practically zero new drilling, with only one active rig this past year. The Barnett\u2019s economics are beaten by more prolific basins.', 'The major oil companies, so called because they are vertically integrated from wellhead to end product, have done well. ExxonMobil began a massive expansion of their Baytown, Texas refinery complex, but only after acquiring a major position in the Permian. ExxonMobil\u2019s huge oil find in Guyana proves again the value of scale. Total acquired Anadarko\u2019s Africa assets after Anadarko\u2019s stumbles in US shale plays led to its acquisition by Occidental Petroleum. Chevron\u2019s aforementioned write-down did not diminish cash flow or prospective rates of return\u2014again, if ever there was an argument for scale, a company that takes a write down of $11 billion and does not miss a beat is certainly one.', 'Oil and gas thrive in the rest of the world. Rates of return for drilling offshore Western Africa, Israel, Brazil and almost any other nation are greater than that for the US shale plays. Of course, that is where the capital is headed. But there is great difficulty in valuing the 80% of the world oil market that is controlled by the national oil companies and regimes that can change the rules when it suits\u2014to wit, the past deals between US companies with Russia, or with Mexico, or with Israel. Investors in the publicly listed Chinese oil companies had a rude awakening when the government directed the companies to increase spending on more domestic exploration. Sovereign risk is real. The Saudi Aramco IPO was Exhibit A for 2019. Saudi Aramco is not equivalent to any US listed and operated company, and it cannot be similarly valued.', 'US independents and those backed by private equity firms that were funded prior to the price war of 2015-16 have lived through capital destruction of more than $250 billion. Among the worst performing asset classes of the S & P 500, these companies remain in a financial limbo with no clear exit. For these companies, Tobin\u2019s q, the ratio of the market value to replacement value, is less than 1. As Anadarko exemplified, these companies are acquisition fodder. Strategic investment in prime candidates may be rewarded. Each investment bank has its Top 10 list that usually contains Apache Corporation, EOG Resources and Noble Energy.', 'A contrarian thesis would be to start now. Pick up the castoffs of the independents and private equity firms. Conventional oil and gas plays in the US offer attractive rates of return, hampered only by the herd mentality of \u201cprofessional\u201d investors.', 'Most of us are short oil. We do not have enough fuel in the tank to get us through the month, week or maybe even today. Our exposure to catastrophe in the oil supply markets is less than one in 10, but significantly more than being hit by lightning or other natural disasters for which we buy insurance. Long dated, out-of-the-money call options on oil would be the equivalent of fire insurance for consumers, and we are all consumers.', '\\nSource: University of Houston Energy']"

He warned that overly idealistic policy could lead to a \u201ctrain wreck.\u201d', 'The Conservative Party manifesto committed the government to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and it is undertaking a review of energy policy, with detailed plans to be set out in the autumn. This week, government minister for business, energy and clean growth Kwasi Kwarteng stressed the need for the industry to cut emissions to ensure its \u201csocial license to operate.\u201d', 'Tholen, speaking before the minister\u2019s comments, said: \u201cWe\u2019re in some very challenging times in that the UK economy is trying to work out what it\u2019s about as we go through Brexit and we also face climate change challenges.\u201d', '\u201cThe challenge for the government is to try and work out what are the things to cling on to as it looks to navigate 2020 and beyond.\u201d', 'Norway and the UK\u2019s oil and gas industries are looking to cut emissions generated in offshore operations and link their facilities with power sources such as wind farms, as well as developing plans to pump carbon dioxide into depleted fields.', 'Tholen highlighted these efforts, but said the UK faced more formidable challenges than Norway.', 'UK offshore platforms account for more than 5% of the country\u2019s power demand and 10% of power plant emissions, partly due to the use of diesel to power ageing facilities in remote locations, according to the Oil & Gas Authority. Norway\u2019s new Johan Sverdrup facilities have been a catalyst for bringing hydropower generated in the country\u2019s fjords to offshore platforms.', 'Tholen said the future was one of integrating multiple energy sources, including oil and gas, wind and wave power.', 'The future \u201cis going to be as much about maximizing the energy potential offshore. The energy isn\u2019t just the hydrocarbons below ground, [it\u2019s] the wind power way above ground, you\u2019ve got the wave power as well. The energy available \u2014 and maybe one day tidal barrages \u2014 is abundant, and we\u2019ve got to find a way of mixing\u201d those, he said.', 'The oil and gas industry is \u201cexpected [by government] to be doing some different things, and we\u2019ve got that and are all working hard on that.\u201d', '\u201cBy all means set high expectations of us, we will meet them, but you need to plan for us to be part of the future. Realistic planning is healthy, idealistic planning frankly can lead to a train wreck,\u201d he said.', 'Tholen said the upstream industry in places like Aberdeen should be able to market accumulated skills in reducing emissions. But he added that recent protests in which activists boarded Shell\u2019s Brent facilities and rigs working for BP had not helped.', '\u201cNipping at our heels is fine, but please look and see what is being achieved and recognize that we are trying our best to be part of the solution,\u201d he said of the Extinction Rebellion and Greenpeace protests. \u201cThere is no easy solution to the fact we need oil and gas for many years ahead of us.\u201d', 'IPO prospects', 'Tholen echoed expectations that some privately owned UK oil and gas companies may list on the London Stock Exchange, creating closer ties with the UK economy and society. He highlighted private equity-backed Neptune Energy and its work on carbon capture and storage in the Dutch North Sea as an example of a private company looking to respond to climate concerns.', '\u201cThe companies I\u2019m thinking of are actively looking at how they both reduce their own emissions and play a part in that future, where the people using their products use them in an increasingly low, and then no-carbon way.\u201d', 'In terms of future oil and gas output, Tholen reiterated OGUK\u2019s view of likely decline from around next year, noting it would take time to bring some major new projects on stream.', 'He voiced confidence, however, in some big projects penciled in for development, including Cambo, a project led by Siccar Point Energy, and Rosebank, a long-delayed project taken over by Norway\u2019s Equinor last year.', '\u201cCambo\u2019s on the move certainly, but Rosebank \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of work still to do to get that one across the line,\u201d Tholen said, describing the Rosebank geology as \u201cdesperately difficult.\u201d', '\u201cThere\u2019s not a plethora of new things coming on. If not a tipping point, we\u2019re back to things being at best pretty steady over the next couple of years, with maybe two years out more downside than upside.\u201d', '\\nSource: ', '\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t']"

This growth rate would be the slowest growth rate in natural gas generation since 2017. EIA forecasts that generation from nonhydropower renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, will grow by 15% in 2020\u2014the fastest rate in four years. Forecast generation from coal-fired power plants declines by 13% in 2020.', 'During the past decade, the electric power sector has been retiring coal-fired generation plants while adding more natural gas generating capacity. In 2019, EIA estimates that 12.7 gigawatts (GW) of coal-fired capacity in the United States was retired, equivalent to 5% of the total existing coal-fired capacity at the beginning of the year. An additional 5.8 GW of U.S. coal capacity is scheduled to retire in 2020, contributing to a forecast 13% decline in coal-fired generation this year. In contrast, EIA estimates that the electric power sector has added or plans to add 11.4 GW of capacity at natural gas combined-cycle power plants in 2019 and 2020.', 'Generating capacity fueled by renewable energy sources, especially solar and wind, has increased steadily in recent years. EIA expects the U.S. electric power sector will add 19.3 GW of new utility-scale solar capacity in 2019 and 2020, a 65% increase from 2018 capacity levels. EIA expects a 32% increase of new wind capacity\u2014or nearly 30 GW\u2014to be installed in 2019 and 2020. Much of this new renewables capacity comes online at the end of the year, which affects generation trends in the following year.', 'Forecast generation mix varies in each of the 11 STEO electricity supply regions. A large proportion of the retired coal-fired capacity is located in the mid-Atlantic area, where PJM manages the dispatch of electricity. EIA forecasts that coal generation in the mid-Atlantic will decline by 37 billion kilowatthours (kWh) in 2020. Some of this decline is offset by more generation from mid-Atlantic natural gas-fired power plants; EIA expects generation from these plants to grow by 23 billion kWh.', 'In the Midwest, where the Midcontinent ISO (MISO) manages electricity, EIA expects coal generation to fall in 2020 by 33 billion kWh. This decline is offset by an increase in natural gas electricity generation (12 billion kWh) and by nonhydropower renewable energy sources (13 billion kWh). The regional increase in renewables is primarily a result of new wind generating capacity.', 'The electric power sector in the area of Texas managed by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) is planning to see large increases in generating capacity from both wind and solar. EIA expects this new capacity will increase generation from nonhydropower renewable energy sources by 24 billion kWh this year. EIA expects the increased ERCOT renewable generation will lead to a regional decline of natural gas-fired generation and coal generation of 14 billion kWh for each fuel source in 2020.', 'EIA expects these trends to continue into 2021. EIA forecasts U.S. generation from nonhydropower renewable energy sources will grow by 17% next year as the electric power sector continues expanding solar and wind capacity. This increase in renewables, along with forecast increases in natural gas fuel costs, contributes to EIA\u2019s forecast of a 2.3% decline in natural gas-fired generation in 2021.

A supply overhang has already hit the country\u2019s paraxylene (PX) market, with olefins and polyolefins markets almost certain to face the same.', 'China is the biggest petrochemical-producing country in the world. Its position as top producer will strengthen with massive investment in the olefins and aromatics chains, driven by demand growth and support from the government.', 'Senior consulting manager Kelly Cui said: \u201cIn 2020, China will see a wave of new capacity coming online from some mega refinery and petrochemical complexes. This supply surge, coupled with a weakening economy, will create severe challenges for China\u2019s petrochemical market. We expect chemical commodity prices to fall further and production margins will continue to be squeezed.\u201d', 'Olefins face supply surge in 2020', '\\nChina will add 5.8 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) of ethylene and 5.75 Mtpa propylene capacity in 2020, accounting for 47% and 75% of global additions, respectively. China\u2019s ethylene capacity addition in 2020 will equate to 57% of South Korea\u2019s total ethylene capacity and 85% of Japan\u2019s total capacity.', 'Pressured by the supply surge, China olefins operating rates will be forced down in 2020. We expect ethylene operating rates to drop from 96% in 2019 to 87% in 2020, while propylene will drop from 82% to around 80%. China\u2019s olefins industry will start to enter a downcycle from 2020.', 'Cui added: \u201cThe opening up of foreign investment and the relaxation of crude oil import licences and quota to Chinese private companies have brought on more capacity to the olefins sector. Demand, on the other hand, is expected to remain stable in 2020. This means the market will become more complicated and volatile.\u201d', 'In 2019, naphtha-based ethylene margins reached their lowest since 2014, averaging US$313/t. Although the 2019 average margin does not appear to be so tight, the market has been in a transition period since Q4 2019 when the ethylene market price dropped below US$800/t. This level has already hit some production cost lines, forcing some producers to cut their operating rates to stabilise the market. In 2020, Wood Mackenzie expects the average ethylene price and margins to drop further.', 'Polyolefins \u2013 Healthy demand, but overcapacity expected', '\\nWeak global economic growth, the US-China trade war, a decrease in automobile production and a booming e-commerce industry influenced China\u2019s polyolefins market last year. The country\u2019s polyethylene and polypropylene incremental growth captured 69% and 61% of total global polyethylene and polypropylene incremental demand, respectively.', 'But robust domestic demand and a weak export market forged different demand patterns between polyethylene and polypropylene last year.', 'Senior consultant William Liu said: \u201cWe expect polyethylene, benefiting from the ecommerce boom, to achieve a higher-than-GDP growth rate for 2019, at around 7.5%. However, polypropylene demand, impacted by weak global economic growth and automobile production, is expected to have grown at 5.9%, just below the GDP growth rate.\u201d', '2019 saw an increase in polyethylene volumes from Asia ex-China clearly reflecting international manufacturers swapping cargoes. The trade war has reshaped the mutual polyethylene trade pattern. HDPE and LLDPE, which are subject to 25% tariffs, have seen their import volumes decrease by 78% and 57%, respectively. Meanwhile, the import volume of LDPE, which has escaped tariffs, has increased by 88%.', 'Liu added: \u201cAlthough we expect healthy polyethylene demand in 2020, the capacity addition is outpacing demand, which will cause market imbalance. The overcapacity may weigh on operation rates. What is making market sentiment worse is that it is just the beginning of the overcapacity cycle. Meanwhile, polypropylene is facing a more severe market. Slower demand growth dragged down by raffia, automobile and home appliances, coupled with new capacity additions will dampen operation rates significantly.\u201d', 'PX market supply continues to increase', '\\nThe paraxylene (PX) market experienced turbulence in 2019. Market supply is lengthening at an unprecedented pace as some of the world\u2019s largest PX buyers have started to operate their own world-scale PX assets. The PX-naphtha spread has more than halved in the past year, and some producers in the region are struggling with negative production margins.', 'Consultant Arthur Luo said: \u201cWe do not expect market fundamentals to improve and it will likely worsen in 2020, as more capacity prepares for start-up. Even more projects are also in the pipeline over the next five years.\u201d', 'In 2019, PX capacity increased by 36% year-on-year to 17.2 Mtpa, while production also increased by 30% to 13 Mtpa. In 2018, exceptional downstream demand growth drove China\u2019s overall utilisation rate up to 80%. But in 2019, utilisation rates dropped to 76%, as new producers stabilised their mega plants, and some existing producers scaled back production. Wood Mackenzie expects domestic PX capacity to grow by another 5 Mtpa in 2020.', '\u201cNewcomers to the PX market are expected to face a slowdown in the downstream polyester market. We expect consumption growth to moderate to 9% in 2019 and to slow down further to 4.6% in 2020. Additional capacity will weigh on margins and depress the overall PX utilisation rate towards 70%,\u201d Luo said.', 'Cui added: \u201cAsset rationalisation, not just in China but also other parts of Asia, will need to happen to help markets to rebalance and allow production margins to recover.\u201d', '\\nSource: Wood Mackenzie']"

    "content": "['The most bountiful petroleum plays in the Middle East may no longer be storied gushers from the past but more technical offshore areas. The most recent hydrocarbon production boom is underway in the Middle East, and this time, the race is spilling into offshore waters. In this particular analysis, Rystad Energy takes a granular look at up and coming offshore exploration projects, most of which are outside Qatar and Iran, the region\u2019s major gas producers. Increased production of oil and gas will not only help the region meet domestic demand as well as notch up exports, it will entice sizeable capital into the region.', 'Figure 1 shows the dramatic increase Rystad Energy expects to see in Middle East offshore exploration spending, led first and foremost by the UAE, which will see upstream investments reach a ballpark figure of close to $1 billion by 2025. Our calculation is based on current commitments, upcoming license awards, and potentially viable future awards. The UAE is followed by Turkey, which could attract an estimated $350 million in spend. Saudi Arabia also could see a sizeable surge with investment reaching $300 million or more based on the results of the feasibility study from their Red Sea and other offshore areas. Bahrain could also potentially see a cosmic rise from just $10 million in 2020 to $230 million in 2025. Investment in Lebanon and Israel will come in waves with up and down years, but still see material gains in upstream spending.', 'The investment upsurge in the coming years will be driven by new drilling contracts, licensing awards and future bid rounds. In this article, we outline the main upcoming offshore activities in Kuwait and the UAE.', '\\nIn July 2019, Kuwait signed a $600 million offshore exploration contract with Halliburton to drill 6 high-pressure high-temperature (HP/HT) exploration wells in the next two to three years, restarting the country\u2019s offshore legacy after a more than 30 year hiatus. This new offshore exploration project with Halliburton could help to add around 100,000 barrels of oil per day in the future.', 'The Kuwait Oil Company (KOC) was able to fast track this contract with government support, most importantly with the introduction of a new tenders law. According to the law, foreign investors are now allowed to directly bid on projects directly without a Kuwaiti partner company. The new law is aimed to debottleneck the significant delays from the obstacles of appointing an agent and registering agencies that allowed foreign entities to participate in project tenders.', 'The offshore exploration work is expected to start in mid-2020 with the first rig expected to come by July 2020 and the second rig by January 2021. With this program, KOC hopes to complement ongoing onshore activity to support long-term domestic gas needs and oil exports. Kuwait has long been targeting to reach production of 4 million barrels per day (up from current production capacity of about 3.1 million bpd) but so far has fallen short in attaining this lofty goal, especially as production decline at the large maturing fields, notably Burgan.', 'Another setback is the loss of production from the Neutral Zone fields, which have been off production since mid-2015 due to political disagreement with Saudi Arabia. Rystad Energy\u2019s current base case is that Neutral Zone production comes back online in early 2021, but expects the ramp-up to be gradual. These damaging setbacks have forced KOC to rethink its $500 billion investment strategy through 2040.', 'The 2040 strategy includes an oil production capacity of 4.75 million bpd and a refining capacity of 2 million bpd. The company is also keen on securing gas supplies plans to increase the country\u2019s gas production capacity to between 3 to 4 billion cubic feet per day (Bcfd) to lessen the burden of importing LNG (which Kuwait has been doing since 2009) and burning oil in power generation.', '\\nUAE has recently seen a series of successful licensing rounds with close to 31,000 square kilometers of acreage being awarded, both offshore and onshore, as shown in Figure 3. A large portion of offshore acreage awarded is located in the Abu Dhabi and Ras Al Khaima regions.', 'Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (Adnoc) launched its first-ever competitive bid round, awarding five blocks and securing more than $800 million in exploration spend. Out of the five blocks, the two offshore blocks have been awarded to a consortium of Eni and PTTEP and the three onshore blocks have been awarded to Occidental, Inpex and a consortium of Indian Oil and Bharat Petroleum.', 'Following the success of the first bidding round, Adnoc has launched a second competitive bidding phase which would offer unconventional blocks for the first time. The round would offer three offshore blocks and two onshore blocks and cover a total area of 32,000 square kilometers. The area contains existing discoveries and 290 targeted reservoirs from 92 prospects.', 'The licensing opportunities of onshore Block 2, onshore Block 5, offshore Block 4 and offshore Block 5 will be awarded in concessions to successful bidders, under terms that will be set out in the bid package. Offshore Block 3 which overlaps, in certain geographical areas, with existing concessions already granted to international oil companies, will be awarded to explore exclusively for potential gas in deep geological formations and potential oil in various formations outside the existing concession areas.', 'Elsewhere in Ras Al Khaima, the shallow offshore Block A was awarded to Eni and a partly onshore/offshore Block 5 to PGNiG. Exploration activity will be carried out in three 2-year phases.', 'The exploration block awards are expected to help the country achieve its 2030 strategy to ramp-up oil production capacity from 3.5 million bpd to 5 million bpd and to become a net exporter of gas. The UAE currently imports 2 Bcfd of natural gas from Qatar via the Dolphin pipeline, for which the contract ends in 2032.', '\\nBahrain\u2019s largest oil and gas discovery in the shallow waters of the Khalij Al-Bahrain Basin in 2018 has prompted the National Oil and Gas Authority (NOGA) perhaps consider US E&P companies with shale expertise to help explore and develop the huge prospective area. Reported discovered volumes are estimated at 80 billion barrels of tight oil and 10 to 20 trillion cubic feet of gas (Tcf), according to the energy ministry. Further appraisal drilling is planned to test the extent of commerciality. Only a fraction of the resources can likely be economically exploited, but given the magnitude, this may result in a significant production boost for Bahrain. Going forward, the next two years will be spent evaluating the commerciality of the discovered resources. One project already well underway kicked off in January 2019 when Eni signed an exploration memorandum of understanding with Bahrain\u2019s energy ministry for an offshore conventional oil block, where drilling is expected to commence by the end of this year.', '\\nIn Saudi Arabia, Saudi Aramco is conducting an investment feasibility study in the Red Sea after unearthing large quantities of gas. To the north in the Mediterranean, state-owned Turkish Petroleum has recently completed the Karpaz-1 wildcat well, which controversially lies in waters claimed by Cyprus.', 'The upcoming license rounds in Israel, Lebanon, the UAE, and Kuwait come at a time as the region is in the midst of ramping up local production to cover domestic energy. As onshore resources mature and become more numbered, offshore exploration is again in the focus. In some cases, we expect the quest to even shift from the mature onshore areas to offshore deep and frontier areas.', '\\nSource: Rystad Energy']"

China wants U.S. oil and gas not only because of their record demand but also because of the price advantage U.S. producers hold over other producers of oil and natural gas. Better trade relations with China may also help with Iran said U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin during an interview on Fox\u2019s \u2018Sunday Morning Futures\u2019 with Maria Bartiromo as the U.S. is working closely to cut off Iranian oil exports.', 'China\u2019s demand for crude oil and natural gas continues to shatter records as the U.S. is now in a prime position to meet its ravenous needs. In data released this month by China\u2019s General Administration of Customs agency, the country imported a record 506 million tons of crude oil. That is equivalent to 10.12 million barrels per day. Chinese natural gas imports, including fuel supplied as liquefied natural gas (LNG) and via pipeline, were 9.45 million tons, the third-highest on record monthly. That made China the world\u2019s largest natural gas importer.', 'China has been energy import crazy and that should have been a big win for U.S. energy.', 'Yet the trade war had China seek other places over the U.S. for its energy needs, including Iran. The trade war has hurt U.S. energy exporters as we start to become a world energy exporter. U.S. exports to China of crude oil and petroleum products hit a record high of 23,951,000 barrels in October of 2017 but have fallen to just 1,119,000 last October, the most recent reading from the Energy Information Administration (EIA). U.S. shale producers have been struggling because they have been producing more energy than we currently need and China would be the perfect customer.', 'The U.S. has just what China needs. Even with the trade war hanging over their heads, the U.S. exported nearly 4.5 million barrels of crude per day two weeks ago which was a new weekly record. The U.S. is producing more oil and natural gas than it needs and China should be a willing buyer. If they act now, the country could take advantage of locking in contracts at favorable prices.', 'But better trade relations may have even more benefits than just energy. In can help us out geopolitically as well. It appears that China will work with the U.S. to pressure Iran by cutting off its purchases of Iranian oil. Roughly 70 percent of the remaining Iranian oil exports are being sent to China, which remains Iran\u2019s biggest crude buyer. Mnuchin said Chinese state-owned companies have ceased buying Iranian oil, suggesting that only independent refiners continue making such purchases. He also said the U.S. was, \u201cworking closely with [China] to make sure that they cease all additional activities [with Iran].\u201d', 'So while the energy markets view the phase one trade with cautious optimism, the long-term benefits of a fair-trade deal with China will extend far beyond energy into a new and prosperous economic era.', 'An era powered by U.S. oil and gas.', '\\nSource: Fox Business']"

But neither the 5% tariff on US crude oil nor the 25% tariff on US LNG is to be reduced or removed by China under the Phase One deal. For China to massively increase imports of oil and LNG from the US while tariffs remain in place, is going to be challenging.', '\u201cConsider LNG. In 2017, China imports from US were approximately 1.5 Mt, worth around $0.6 billion. If China is to increase the value of US LNG imports considerably as a part of this agreement, let\u2019s say to around 10 Mt in 2021, then the 25% tariff would need to be either absorbed by the importing company, or passed through to the consumer. We expect that Chinese national oil companies will be reluctant to commit to large-scale purchases given this. At the same time, the next two years will also see a slower pace of gas demand growth in China, rising domestic production, and the arrival of Russian pipeline gas, creating a more competitive gas market.', '\u201cThe Chinese uncontracted LNG demand is estimated to be 17 Mt in 2020 and 23 Mt in 2021; US off-takers will now be looking to target this market.', '\u201cContract and portfolio suppliers with contracted supply into China and US off-takers \u2013 notably Shell, BP and Cheniere \u2013 could also target increasing volumes of US LNG within existing contracts into China, if agreement can be reached with key buyers, including CNOOC and PetroChina.\u201d', '\\nSource: Wood Mackenzie']"

We cannot know how the geopolitical situation will play out over time, but for now the risk of a major threat to oil supplies appears to have receded. As was the case following the attacks on Saudi Arabia in September, once the initial fears of a sustained supply shock subsided, the Brent price rapidly gave up its $4/bbl spike and as we publish this Report it is just above $64/bbl, little changed from immediately after the OPEC+ agreement was signed in December. Today\u2019s market where non-OPEC production is rising strongly and OECD stocks are 9 mb above the five-year average, provides a solid base from which to react to any escalation in geopolitical tension. As a back-up resource, the value of strategic stocks has once again been confirmed.', 'Recent events have shown that Iraq is a potentially vulnerable supplier, just as its strategic importance has grown. In recent years production and export capacity have expanded fast: in 2010 Iraq exported 2 mb/d and now the figure is 4 mb/d. Iraq\u2019s rising capacity has been very welcome as sanctions have reduced Iran\u2019s exports to only 0.3 mb/d and Venezuela\u2019s production has collapsed. Today, both China and India receive about 1 mb/d of oil from Iraq and another 1 mb/d moves to various European countries. In India\u2019s case, around 20% of its crude imports come from Iraq. Amongst Iraq\u2019s other customers is the US. Data from the Energy Information Administration show that in January-October 2019 the US imported 337 kb/d from Iraq, and just below 1 mb/d from the Middle East Gulf as a whole. In the medium term heightened security concerns might make it more difficult for Iraq to build production capacity. In turn, this could make it more difficult to ensure there is sufficent spare production capacity to meet rising global demand in the second half of this decade.', 'In this Report, our main headline data for 2020 is largely unchanged from last month. Oil demand growth is forecast to accelerate to 1.2 mb/d, supported partly by prices remaining relatively subdued, higher global GDP growth than last year and by progress in settling trade disputes.

The plans for constitutional reforms announced Wednesday would shift some powers away from the president to parliament and the prime minister. Putin\u2019s presidential term of office expires in 2024 and, under the current constitution, he will have to step down when it expires.

    "title": "The Bear Case For Oil: Possible Recession",
    "content": "['A year ago, there was near unanimity among pundits, I mean experts, that a recession was quite likely for 2019. The economic expansion was getting long in the tooth, labor markets were very tight, and for a period, the yield curve for bonds was inverted, a near-perfect predictor of looming recession. Added to that, the chaotic nature of U.S. politics and uncertainty created by on-again, off-again tariff policies seemed to suggest expectations of a recession were well-based. ', 'Instead, consumer spending remained strong, the stock market rose sharply, so that the experts sheepishly admitted they got it wrong. (I also made all the above arguments and was equally wrong.) But the lesson is not that the economy is not threatened with recession, but that it simply didn\u2019t come last year. Some combination of fiscal stimulus from tax cuts and lower interest rates, lower costs from deregulation, and simple consumer confidence has kept the U.S. economy buoyant.', 'This is not to say that the earlier expectations of a recession were incorrect, just that the timing was misjudged. Anyone who has followed economics for a long time should realize by now that economic principles are almost always valid but with uncertain timing. The uncertainty created by the Administration\u2019s volatile policies has not triggered a recession\u2014yet. Low unemployment hasn\u2019t triggered inflation\u2014yet.', 'Several admittedly fuzzy indicators make me concerned that the likelihood of recession has increased. One long-standing, tongue-in-cheek idea is that when the consensus is that we\u2019ve conquered the business cycle, expect a recession (aka \u2018reality bites\u2019). This could be considered valid in an indirect way: economists think the business cycle has been conquered only when an expansion has lasted a long time, and recessions are more likely after a lengthy expansion.', 'Another argument that I have made is when silly expenditures become common, people have too much money, which suggests that assets will probably become over-priced. Past examples include \u2018oxygen bars\u2019 in the 1990s where the well-off go to inhale air supposedly from pristine locations like Antarctica or now, \u2018raw\u2019 water for upwards of $24 a gallon. ', 'Twenty-one years ago, in 1998, I was in a bar in Australia reading Charles Kindleberger\u2019s \u201cPanics, Manias, and Crashes\u201d (yes, I\u2019m a wild man) and the Asian financial crisis was underway. I noticed on the cover there was a blurb from Robert Solow to the effect that someday you will find this book relevant to current events. It cracked me up.', 'But the larger point was that Kindleberger noted that many crashes were preceded by an expansion of credit which led to asset inflation, but also debt, which created a later crash. I think of that now watching cable news with the many ads from companies with aps that allow businesses and individuals make loans quickly and easily. Combined with the recent headline \u201cWorld Bank Warns Rapid Increase in Debt,\u201d and there is obvious reason for concern.', 'So now, some combination of business uncertainty because of the trade war, consumer worries about a war with Iran, higher interest rates due to rising labor costs, or some black swan event could trigger a new recession, which would put pressure on an already-stressed oil market. But the flip side is that OPEC+, and especially Saudi Arabia, would almost certainly respond with new production cuts. After all, one of the prime motivations for cartels, whoever defined, has been to deal with short-term, transient weakness in demand, to avoid having businesses fail due to external conditions. (Recession cartels have often been used, more in Europe and Japan than the U.S.) While the sustainable long-term oil price is, as always, debatable, current Saudi policy suggests that they would not hesitate in response to downward pressure on oil demand due to a period of economic weakness.', '\\nSource: Forbes']"

It was the second extension of that waiver, initially issued in January 2019, when the bulk of US sanctions on Venezuelan oil flows went into effect.', 'The waiver has been extended based on the argument that the presence of US companies is necessary to prevent the complete collapse of Venezuela\u2019s oil sector, easing an expected recovery once Maduro was forced out of power.', 'But analysts with ClearView Energy Partners believe that Maduro\u2019s persistent hold on power and his latest efforts to take over the National Assembly weaken the argument for allowing the waiver to stay in place. And, with a US presidential race approaching, the Trump administration may be \u201cincreasingly wary of the appearance of going soft on Maduro by offering sanctions leniency,\u201d they said.', 'Some analysts believe that Venezuela\u2019s oil output, which averaged 700,000 b/d in November, could plunge below 300,000 b/d if the waiver is allowed to expire, making this option an attractive one to Trump administration officials eager to ratchet up pressure on the Maduro regime.', 'But this move will also come with a cost for the Trump administration and may, ultimately, prove ineffective.', 'Any decline in production may be short-lived if Rosneft, or another Russian or Chinese company, takes control of Chevron\u2019s Venezuelan assets.', 'Analysts estimate that if Rosneft were to take over Chevron\u2019s operations it could return output to current levels within 45 days.', 'Chevron, which has cautioned that ending the waiver could leave a post-Maduro government with an irrevocably damaged oil sector, has recently pushed the argument that an expired waiver would simply benefit Chinese and Russian companies, sources said.', '\u201cIf Chevron is forced to leave Venezuela, non-US companies will fill the void and oil production will continue,\u201d Ray Fohr, a Chevron spokesman, told S&P Global Platts this week.', 'Refiners move on', '\\nWith the status of the waiver unclear, Elliott Abrams, State\u2019s special representative for Venezuela, told reporters in Washington that the Maduro regime\u2019s efforts to undermine democracy would be met with severe penalties from the Trump administration.', '\u201cWe are looking at additional sanctions, personal sanctions, economic sanctions that we think will bring more pressure yet on the regime,\u201d Abrams said.', 'Sanctions have become a frequent tool of reprimand for the Trump administration, with prohibitions on trade with Iran and North Korea and threats on more.', 'But US oil sanctions on Venezuela will soon be a year old and US refiners have moved on, importing their last Venezuelan barrel in May, according to the US Energy Information Administration. Yet Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro remains in power.', 'Sanctions, analysts believe, may have run their course and the Trump administration may have limited options.', '\u201cThere isn\u2019t much more room for the administration to ratchet up sanctions against Venezuela, and increased sanctions would anyway be unlikely to spark Maduro\u2019s fall,\u201d said Lisa Viscidi, director of the Inter-American Dialogue\u2019s energy, climate change and extractive industries program.', 'Analysts believe the next steps may include: new sanctions, targeting specific entities and individuals; an end of sanctions waivers; and legislation by the US Congress.', 'Secondary sanctions on the table', '\\nAnalysts have long said the most significant action would be the imposition of secondary sanctions, with the US prohibiting all petroleum trade with PDVSA, Venezuela\u2019s state-owned oil company, modeled after secondary sanctions the US has imposed on Iranian crude oil exports.', 'Secondary sanctions are \u201con the table,\u201d Viscidi said.', 'Similarly, the US could directly sanction Rosneft, the Russian oil company currently facilitating the bulk of Venezuela\u2019s petroleum exports.', 'Back in August, a senior Trump administration official told S&P Global Platts that the US was prepared to sanction Rosneft if it continued to trade crude oil and fuel with PDVSA.', 'But analysts believe the administration has been hesitant to impose sanctions on Rosneft, in addition to imposing broader secondary sanctions, because of the impact such a move may have on the larger global market.', '\u201cOf course the Trump administration has the option to apply secondary sanctions and target Rosneft, but it has proven to be very sensitive to the global repercussions that could entail,\u201d said David Voght, managing director of IPD Latin America. \u201cRosneft is clearly bolstering Venezuelan exports, and consequently supporting production, but the company claims that it is doing so within the structure of US sanctions.\u201d', 'Abrams with State told reporters that roughly 70% of current Venezuelan oil trade is currently handled by Russian companies, including marketing, financing and facilitating ship-to-ship transfers of oil in order to complicate surveillance.', 'Viscidi said with administration efforts failing to oust Maduro from office, the US Congress is likely to get more involved. One effort may be the Venezuelan Contracting Restriction Act (S. 1151) which was introduced by Senator Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, in April.', 'The bill would prohibit companies operating in Venezuela from contracting with the US government, forcing international oil companies operating in Venezuela to choose between Venezuela and access to the US market.

But, more quietly, its Gulf oil peer ADNOC has also been courting foreign funds \u2013 and its efforts compare favourably.', 'Like Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi\u2019s economy was hit by a dramatic fall in oil prices in mid-2014, triggering a drive to reduce its dependence on crude. A central part of that has been to reform and modernise state champion ADNOC and attract foreign investment.', 'Unlike Aramco\u2019s push for a giant stock market listing, which has been highly publicised and closely watched, ADNOC has gone for a more staggered approach with its fundraising efforts, and there has been little overview of their scope by industry experts.', 'However the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, to give its full name, has raised more than $19 billion over the past three years from overseas investors, according to Reuters calculations based on publicly released size of investments, signing fees and share sales.', 'That\u2019s equivalent to two-thirds of the $29.4 billion that Saudi Aramco raised in the biggest initial public offering (IPO) in history. Despite the record-breaking December listing, the bulk of the shares were sold to domestic investors after foreign institutions baulked at the valuation.', 'ADNOC, which supplies nearly 3% of global oil demand, has for example struck deals with the world\u2019s largest fund manager BlackRock BLK.N and with U.S. investment firm KKR, a rare foray for both into national oil companies in the Middle East.', 'It has also sold stakes in its pipeline infrastructure and refining businesses. See FACTBOX on key deals:', 'While both Gulf state-controlled firms are aiming to replicate the model of oil majors by expanding in downstream, trading and petrochemicals, their funding strategies diverge, said Dmitry Marinchenko, analyst with Fitch rating agency.', '\u201cAramco is raising funds mainly by conventional borrowing while ADNOC is using more sophisticated forms of funding, including selling minority stakes in subsidiaries,\u201d he said. \u201cADNOC is more open to cooperation with international partners.\u201d', 'It remains to be seen which approach to attracting investment will prove more fruitful in coming years. But at stake could be the companies\u2019 ability to successfully diversify from crude production and, more broadly, for the domestic economies that rely on them to weather oil price shocks.', '\u201cThe biggest challenge is the uncertainty in the outlook for oil and the growing international scrutiny that all energy companies are facing because of climate change,\u201d said Helima Croft, managing director of RBC Capital Markets.', 'PRINCE PUSHES FOR CHANGE', '\\nThe reforms have been driven by Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, de-facto ruler of the wider United Arab Emirates. Their roots can be traced back to 2016, when oil prices fell to $30 a barrel, hitting state revenues and exposing how sensitive Abu Dhabi finances were to volatile prices.', 'The crown prince, known as MbZ, appointed ally Sultan al-Jaber as CEO of ADNOC with a plan to restructure the company to make it more efficient and function more like a major than a state monopoly.', 'Al-Jaber swiftly embarked on plans to reshuffle ADNOC\u2019s leadership and slashed 5,000 jobs, mainly foreigners, out of its 60,000 employees.', 'It is no easy task to change the course of an organisation viewed as one of the most conservative in the region, however. ADNOC\u2019s production depended on decades-old concessions with Western oil majors, some of which have been operating in the UAE since the 1930s, and new deals and foreign investment were uncommon.', 'In April 2016, two months after installing al-Jaber, MbZ made a rare visit to ADNOC\u2019s headquarters to deliver a wake-up call to managers and staff.', 'His message, demanding a sharp change in a culture of entitlement, was unexpected in a nation where most citizens expect guaranteed state jobs with long-term security.', 'He told ADNOC employees they should feel no sense of entitlement, and that the UAE cannot be chained to oil price fluctuations anymore, whether at $30 or $100 a barrel, said Haif Zamzam, vice president of transformation and business supply at ADNOC who was present during the crown prince\u2019s visit.', '\u201cHe said \u2018You show me your CV and you show me your experience, you show me what you are able to actually do, and you have great opportunities,\u201d said Zamzam, who had worked with al-Jaber at state investor Mubadala.', 'The visit sent a message to ADNOC\u2019s old guard that he would not brook any opposition, said people familiar with the company.', '\u201cPeople used to come to ADNOC to clock in and clock out and leave at 2pm, and they expect their children to also work there. That is not the case anymore,\u201d said one UAE-based industry source.', 'STRETCHING THE DOLLAR', '\\nAl-Jaber, a minister of state and a former CEO at Mubadala\u2019s energy unit who holds a PhD in business and economics, was tasked with making ADNOC profitable enough to contribute to the UAE\u2019s budget even with lower oil prices.', '\u201cWe wanted to challenge the conventional business model of the National Oil Company,\u201d he told Reuters in an interview at his office on the 63rd floor of ADNOC\u2019s skyscraper HQ.', '\u201cTo make it simple \u2013 we are in the business of stretching the dollar from every barrel we produce.\u201d', 'ADNOC does not publish financial results but, nonetheless, investors appear to like the changes.', 'KKR\u2019s investment in 2019, its first as a direct investment in the region, was due to ADNOC\u2019s reforms, a spokesman for the U.S. firm said.', 'ADNOC has formed new partnerships with European and Asian energy firms such as Italy\u2019s Eni ENI.MI and China\u2019s CNPC to boost its oil, gas and trading businesses, and was the first foreign company with a deal to store oil in India\u2019s strategic reserves.', 'In his drive to emulate oil majors, al-Jaber has lured employees from Total TOTF.PA, Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L and BP BP.L to launch new trading operations. He has also led a change in the way ADNOC plans to change the way it prices its oil by establishing a new crude benchmark.', 'The pace of the reforms has surprised industry players.', '\u201cHe transformed the company,\u201d said Claudio Descalzi, CEO of Eni, one of ADNOC\u2019s newest partners.', 'Al-Jaber stressed the reforms were ongoing.', 'ADNOC plans to invest $45 billion to expand its refining and petrochemicals operations with partners and is looking to boost its international market share for crude and fuel, he said.', '\u201cWe don\u2019t want only to stick to the known or the traditional partners,\u201d said the CEO. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to leave any stone unturned.\u201d', '\\nSource: Reuters (Additional reporting by Dahlia Nehme, Saeed Azhar in Dubai and Ron Bousso in London; Editing by Simon Webb and Pravin Char)']"

The market structure of all three crude benchmarks ICE Brent, NYMEX WTI and DME Oman remained in backwardation. Money managers increased their speculative net long positions on the back of more bullish sentiment.', 'World Economy', '\\nThe global economic growth remains at 3.0% for 2019, but is revised up by 0.1 pp to 3.1% for 2020.

On average, dirty tanker spot freight rates rose by 29% m-o-m on the back of increased tonnage requirements and high bunker prices. In the clean tanker market, increased tonnage was observed in the different routes, leading to an increase in average clean tanker spot freight rates by 18% m-o-m. Enhanced market activity was seen to drive rates higher on all routes, affecting all tanker sectors in the market.

    "title": "A New Offshore Investment Cycle Is In The Making",
    "content": "['In retrospect, 2019 was another strong year for offshore exploration and production companies. Free cash flow remained strong and telltale signs have emerged that we are entering a new offshore investment cycle. This trend was perhaps illustrated most profoundly by the rising swell of offshore project approval activity by operators in 2019. Globally, the amount of oil and gas resources approved for development last year surpassed 20 billion barrels of oil equivalent (boe), the highest level seen since 2011.', 'A quick look at free cash flow (FCF) levels in recent years confirms that 2019 was a strong year for the offshore sector. Figure 1 shows the total offshore FCF from all public E&P companies globally. This shows that 2019 was the third best year on record, with FCF reaching nearly $90 billion. This represented a slight reduction compared to 2018, but compares very favorably with the previous investment cycle from 2010 to 2014. This shows that the cash flow situation for offshore players is very robust, underlining the point that E&Ps have enough cash in hand to invest in new projects after several years of restrained capital expenditure.', 'This trend is clearly reflected when looking at project approval activity in 2019. Figure 2 provides an overview of total approved offshore resources each year over the past decade, split by liquids and gas. Last year saw the approval of 12.3 billion barrels of liquids projects, along with 8.3 billion boe of new gas projects, thus bringing total approved resources to 20.6 billion boe. Given that the total amount of offshore production in 2019 was 10.1 billion barrels of liquids and 7.0 billion boe of gas, this implies a replacement ratio of 1.2 for both oil and gas. The approved volumes in 2019 were 110% higher than 2018, and the highest number since 2011.', 'Figure 3 shows approved offshore greenfield investments (designated for the development of new projects) by year of sanctioning. Once again, a strong increase in activity is seen in 2019. Total greenfield investments approved last year increased by 50% versus 2018. This significant rise in approved resources and investments was driven by several very large developments that were approved last year, such as the massive Marjan and Berri expansion projects in Saudi Arabia. These projects feature very large resource bases and offer lower greenfield investment cost per boe compared to smaller projects. Measured in dollars, comparing last year\u2019s investment levels with the years during the previous investment cycle from 2010 through 2014 does not tell the whole story, as cost levels within the E&P industry have come down significantly since 2014.', 'Figure 4 shows the 15 largest offshore projects approved last year, measured by total greenfield capex. The expansion phase of Saudi Aramco\u2019s Marjan field in Saudi Arabia was by far the largest project approved last year, with close to $12 billion in investments. The project aims to add 24 new offshore platforms to handle initial oil and gas processing and water injection. These platforms will tie into the onshore expansion of the Tanajib oil facilities, as well as other newly built onshore gas facilities. The second largest project on the list is the first phase of Total\u2019s Area 1 development in Mozambique. This gas project will be developed as a subsea tieback to an onshore LNG plant. Chevron\u2019s Anchor field development in the US is the largest project within the Atlantic region, just ahead of the second phase of Equinor\u2019s Johan Sverdrup field in Norway.', 'Unsurprisingly, this rising tide of approval activity has carried with it an increase in offshore investments in 2019. Total offshore capex grew by 5% versus 2018, with a 7% rise in deepwater spending and a 3% boost in investments on the continental shelf. For 2020, offshore investments are on track to grow 8%, with deepwater up 12% and shelf spending up 2% (see Figure 5). This illustrates that a new offshore investment cycle is in the making.', '\\nSource: Rystad Energy']"

    "content": "['Dramatic initial price reaction to US-Iranian hostilities in Persian Gulf, although less than before the US shale revolution', 'Oil prices have had a tumultuous week since the US launched a drone attack in Baghdad, killing Iranian General Qassem Soleimani. With tensions peaking after the US and Iran traded missile attacks, oil markets priced in a risk premium. However, as long as the flow of oil barrels to the market is not affected, Rystad Energy continues to see a downward risk to prices, with further pressure on OPEC to implement even deeper production cuts in order to keep Brent oil prices around $60 per barrel through 2020.', '\u201cIt is important to look beyond the rhetoric of the headlines and focus on market fundamentals \u2013 including the continued rise of non-OPEC oil supply led by US shale, and flat demand growth \u2013 which all points to a surplus, not a deficit, in oil balances in 2020,\u201d says Bj\u00f8rnar Tonhaugen, Head of Oil Market Research at Rystad Energy. \u201cProspects of Brent prices slipping below $60 per barrel \u2013 even in the midst of an intense geopolitical flare up in the Middle East \u2013 are entirely plausible.\u201d', 'Oil prices still react dramatically to news of tensions in the Persian Gulf, although less dramatically now than they would have before the US shale revolution. The importance of the region for oil markets is obvious, given that seven Gulf countries alone \u2013 Saudi Arabia, Iraq, UAE, Kuwait, Iran, Oman and Qatar \u2013 produced around 24 million bpd of crude oil in December 2019.', '\u201cWith the regime in Tehran under heavy sanctions, Iran is no longer an official major global oil producer. This means the real risk of a conflict between the US and Iran gets pushed to neighboring Iraq, where 5,000 American troops are stationed and where Iran is wrestling for political power. Any proxy war played out in Iraq would put the country\u2019s nearly 4.7 million bpd of crude oil and condensate production as risk,\u201d states Tonhaugen.', 'However, one key reason that geopolitically-driven oil price swings are now more subdued relates to the stabilizing effect of US shale oil production on global oil supplies. The stellar growth of shale has introduced a significant counterweight to the market, as it helps to absorb disruptive events such as the September drone attack on Saudi Arabian oil infrastructure and the geopolitical tensions that followed the assassination of General Soleimani.', 'Rystad Energy forecasts that the \u2018call\u2019 on OPEC (in other words, the market demand for OPEC oil) will average about 28.3 million bpd during the final nine months of 2020. By comparison, OPECs actual production in December 2019 was 29.6 million bpd, and the cartel\u2019s new implied production target for the first quarter of 2020 is 29.2 million bpd.', '\\nSource: Rystad Energy']"

Even so, very few respondents expect average prices to fall below $50 or rise above $90 at any point in the next five years.', 'Response clustering has been increasing in recent surveys, suggesting the anchoring of long-term expectations around the $65-70 per barrel level is becoming stronger.', 'The longer prices trade around the $65-70 level, with production and consumption roughly in balance, the more expectations are becoming cemented around this level.', 'Over the last 27 months, since the start of November 2017, Brent prices have closed between $60 and $75 per barrel on 74% of all trading days, with just 10% of closes below this level and $16% above it.', 'Overall, most respondents expect the oil market to remain comfortably supplied in the foreseeable future, with prices oscillating around the current level and relatively moderate volatility.', '\\nSource: Reuters (Editing by Jan Harvey)']"

    "title": "The Affordable Energy Transition",
    "content": "['It is not too good to be true, it is the economic reality that lies ahead of us. The energy transition facing us in the coming decades is an affordable one. In fact, the future energy system is not only affordable, it is cheaper than the energy system we have today. And this creates an opportunity to invest more to achieve the future we want.', 'Let me be more precise: in just one generation, humanity will be spending a much lower share of its GDP on energy than it does today. The main reason is not energy prices, but energy efficiency. Whether you believe in the phenomenon of peak energy, as DNV GL does, or just increased efficiency, the conclusion is the same, and it is robust.', 'Affordability is reward enough, but there is an even more important win \u2013 we are heading towards a decarbonized energy future. But do not pop the champagne yet. Our Energy Transition Outlook (ref. 1) outlines the most likely future as DNV GL sees it. The energy transition, modelled to the best of our ability, is far too slow; we are not on track for a Paris-compliant future.', 'Some of the savings that therefore accrue from a much more efficient energy system need to be ploughed into speeding things up, investing in R&D, technology support, policy incentives and other activities increasing the pace of the transition. And even if society does invest and achieve Paris ambitions, the transition is affordable, purely in energy economic terms. The stakes beyond energy economics are of course far larger; the costs of runaway global warming are close to incalculable.', 'What should count as \u2018energy expenditures\u2019 is open to debate. DNV GL\u2019s Energy Transition Outlook uses a strict definition, including only fossil-fuel extraction, refinement and conversion, installation and operation of renewable energy plants, and all costs incurred by the power sector. The definition could have been extended with energy efficiency measures, energy transport costs, and energy support and subsidies. Using our definition, present expenditures are at 4.6 trn USD annually, and will grow in absolute terms to 5.6 trn USD annually in 2050, as illustrated in Figure 1.', 'There are different views of the unit costs of energy going forward. Renewable energy production will inevitably be cheaper, while grid complexity increases and will be more expensive. Fossil energy extraction is helped by technology improvements, but is also moving to more challenging conditions. Without going into details, it is likely that the relative costs of a unit of energy will stay within the same range as today. On a global accumulated level, DNV GL figures show average energy costs slowly increasing from 8 to 10 USD/GJ over the next 30 years.', 'But the world economy is growing at a much faster speed than energy expenditures. With an average expected growth in global GDP of 2.6% per year the global economy will be 130% larger than it is today. Illustrated in Figure 2, this is a story about affordability.', 'Would this conclusion change if we included costs that are excluded from our energy expenditure definitions? No. The costs would add to the absolute costs and percentages, e.g. fossil fuel subsidies today are in the range of 400 bn USD (ref. 2), renewable subsidies at 150 bn USD (ref. 2), and energy efficiency costs at 240 bn USD (ref. 3). The first is likely to decrease the coming decades, the two latter to increase, but the change in the figures will remain too small to alter the overall conclusion.', 'The overarching driver of affordability is energy efficiency. This is best illustrated as improvement in global energy intensity \u2013 the global primary energy consumption per unit of GDP. Energy intensity has improved 1.6% per year over the last decades. With increased electrification and more efficient energy end use in all sectors and all regions, we expect global energy intensity reduction to be 2.5% per year on average towards 2050.', 'The shift gives us the watershed moment of peak energy, when humanity \u2013 in spite of population and economic growth and great improvements in energy access for poorer populations \u2013 will start to use less energy (ref. 4).', 'The main reason for the affordable transition is the reduction \u2013 both absolute and relative to economic growth \u2013 in global energy use, not changes in energy costs.', '\\nThe market, left to its own devices, tends to be short-sighted. Unless forced by rules and regulations, most energy developments are economically rational in the short term. What if we forced the energy system to achieve Paris ambitions, would this be costly? Yes and no.', 'Various references exist on the cost of achieving Paris ambitions. Most of them also include the benefits of reducing climate change damages. However, if we confine ourselves narrowly just to the extra costs involved in decarbonizing the energy system, that could add up to an additional annual cost of 0.4-0.8% of GDP (ref. 5). If we add this number to the GDP share for energy expenditures shown in Figure 2, we see that the transition is still affordable, with a clear margin.', 'The conclusion that the energy transition is affordable is valid even without considering the benefits of avoiding the dangerous consequences of global warming, which obviously are compelling.', 'Something for the COP 25 negotiators to bear in mind!', 'References:', '\\nEach week, we will be joined by the world\u2019s leading energy experts to discuss their insights and opinions on how governments, business leaders and wider society can help accelerate the energy transition.', 'The new season has been kickstarted with an interview with Remi Eriksen, Group President and CEO of DNV GL, who explores the key findings from the 2019 Energy Transition Outlook (ETO) report and discusses what more can be done globally to accelerate the energy transition.', '\\nSource: DNV GL']"

Twenty years ago, it was faddish for people in the oil business to talk about the then-assumed fact that \u201call the elephants have been found,\u201d with the word \u201celephant\u201d referring to massive reserves of crude oil and/or natural gas. I cannot begin to count the number of times I heard that bit of conventional wisdom expressed by speakers at IPAA or API conferences during that period of time around the turn of the century.', 'As things have turned out, there were and are still elephants out there around the world, and the oil and gas industry keeps finding them. A new report from Rystad Energy finds that global oil and gas discoveries outside of the United States in fact reached a 4-year high during 2019, and the vast majority of them had nothing to do with shale or fracking.', 'According to the report, \u201cThe world\u2019s oil and gas explorers powered ahead and discovered 12.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent (boe) in 2019, the highest volume since 2015, according to estimates from Rystad Energy. Last year recorded 26 discoveries of more than 100 million boe, with offshore regions dominating the list of new oil and gas deposits.\u201d', 'By far the largest, in terms of discovered oil resource, of the offshore regions to which the report refers was the Stabroek block offshore Guyana, the small nation adjacent to Venezuela on the north-central coast of South America. There, a consortium comprised of ExxonMobil, Hess and CNOOC announced four major new discoveries during 2019. Tullow Oil also announced two major discoveries on its own acreage to the west of Stabroek during the year. All told, \u201cRystad Energy estimates that the discoveries in Guyana hold cumulative recoverable resources of around 1.8 billion boe.\u201d', 'Of course, the 2019 numbers do not include last week\u2019s announced major new discovery offshore Suriname \u2013 just to the East of Guyana \u2013 by Houston-based Apache Corp. and French giant T0tal. Obviously, this north-central South America region holds great promise for the future.', 'But this story is not just about crude oil \u2013 2019 was also characterized by an array of new natural gas discoveries. The largest of those were drilled in Russia and Mauritania, both of which were home to over 1.3 billion boe in natural gas finds. Additional major natural gas resources were discovered in Iran, Cyprus, South Africa and Malaysia.', 'So, while the oil and natural gas booms in U.S. shale in general and the Permian and Marcellus Shale basins specifically tend to get the lion\u2019s share of the energy-related news attention here in the United States, it\u2019s important to know that another boom is taking place internationally, one that helps to ensure the world\u2019s future energy security.', 'Meanwhile, back in the United States\u2026 \u2013 None of this is to discount the impacts of the Shale Revolution, which has radically shifted the global energy picture over the past decade. In fact, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) published a new report of its own Monday morning, documenting the record-setting levels of proved oil and natural gas reserves and production that came about in the U.S. during 2018, the most current year for which complete data is available.', 'The EIA finds that U.S. 2018 production of oil and lease condensate grew by a whopping 17% over 2017 levels, while natural gas volumes for 2018 were up by 12%. Reserve additions also grew dramatically during the year, with proved oil reserves surpassing the previous record set in 2017 by 12%, and reserves of natural gas rising by 9% year-over-year.', 'While the U.S. boom obviously did slow during 2019, it is important to note that represents just a slowing in the rate of increase, not an overall contraction. The EIA\u2019s current data indicates that October 2019 U.S. oil production (the most recent month available) was 627,000 bopd higher than in December 2018. U.S. natural gas production, meanwhile, rose by more than 10% between December 2018 and October 2019.', 'So, bottom line, the world is in the midst of the one of the largest oil and natural gas booms of modern times. It is a boom that will continue to promote global prosperity and security for many years to come.', '\\nSource: Forbes']"

McKay said: \u201cThe window for upstream producers to lock-in low development costs for new projects will extend into 2020 and beyond in most sectors.', '\u201cFor the supply chain, that means business will continue to be hard-fought and margins will remain under pressure; the nadir has longer to run.\u201d ', 'Apart from isolated hot spots, the service sector will need to adjust and consolidate in 2020 as finances are stretched still further.

Additionally, a Russian navy ship \u201caggressively approached\u201d a U.S. Navy destroyer in the North Arabian Sea on Thursday, the U.S. Navy\u2019s Bahrain-based Fifth Fleet said in a statement on Friday. \u201cWith the standing down of Iran there was a sense that oil supplies were pretty safe but now with the institution of sanctions and this report that a Russian ship was acting aggressively toward a U.S. ship, it\u2019s put a little bit of fear back into the market place,\u201d said Phil Flynn, oil analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago, according to a report by Reuters.

Last year also marked 26 discoveries of more than 100 million boe, with offshore regions dominating the list of new oil and gas deposits. The success of ExxonMobil in Guyana from 2018 continued in 2019, with Exxon adding four new discoveries within the offshore Stabroek block. Meanwhile, Tullow Oil\u2019s Jethro and Joe exploration wells established the presence of working petroleum systems to the west of the Stabroek block. Overall, the discoveries in Guyana hold cumulative recoverable resources of around 1.8 billion boe according to Rystad Energy\u2019s estimates. \u201cExxonMobil can be declared explorer of the year for a second year in a row thanks to its ongoing efforts and results in Guyana, along with significant investments in Cyprus.

This pump is designed to move 500 barrels of liquid per day. Fracture stimulation load water was 9,900 barrels used in the single stage short lateral. A smaller pump is being utilized based on the frac size and a variable speed drive is also installed allowing for the increase or decrease in production volumes based on well conditions. The well is currently producing 160 to 180 barrels of fluid per day with approximately 15% load recovery. Intake pressure remains over 1000 psi and the Company is anticipating increased hydrocarbon content as the frac load and intake pressure both decline.', '\u2018We are very encouraged to be seeing oil and gas shows from this well early in the frac flowback process,\u2019 stated John Brda, Torchlight\u2019s CEO. \u2018With the frac size and design used, we have stimulated both the matrix and fracture system in the Penn formation\u2019s dual porosity composition. Once we establish an Initial Potential (IP) production rate we will have necessary data to both estimate initial production potential and reserves from extended length laterals using multi-stage fracture stimulation techniques. The stimulation of this 100-foot lateral interval should provide us the evidence required to prove commercial viability in the oil window of the Pennsylvanian formation, which is critical to project marketability.\u2019', 'Occidental Petroleum Corp.

At that point, he said the challenge would be making sure that other producers \u201ccan meet the demand that keeps rising.\u201d', 'The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects American oil production to average 13.2 million barrels a day (b/d) in 2020, an increase of 0.9 million b/d from the 2019 level. However, growth in supply is slowing from the last few years with 2018 growth of 1.6 million b/d and 2019 growth of 1.3 million b/d.', 'In September 2019, the U.S. exported exported 90,000 b/d more total crude oil and petroleum products than it imported, the first month recorded in U.S. data where it had exported more than it had imported. But in its latest short-term energy outlook released in January, the IEA noted that slowing crude oil production growth will result from a decline in drilling rigs over the past year and that it expected this trend to continue into 2020.', '\u201cDespite the decline in rigs, EIA forecasts (oil) production will continue to grow as rig efficiency and well-level productivity rises, offsetting the decline in the number of rigs,\u201d it noted.', 'Shale\u2019s place in the ecosystem', '\\nBenchmark Brent crude is trading around the $65 dollar mark while West Texas Intermediate (WTI) is trading just below the $60 per barrel level. Prices have been more or less stable since oil producer group OPEC, along with Russia and several other producers, curbed their own production to limit supply and rebalance global oil prices.', 'They have done this in the face of (and pressure from) massive U.S. shale oil production, however. There are concerns, especially among the OPEC+ alliance as it is now known, that efforts to stabilize prices are being hampered by growing U.S. supply and a shaky outlook for demand.', 'Jason Bordoff, professor and director at Columbia University\u2019s Center on Global Energy Policy, characterized U.S. shale oil as a \u201cnew dynamic of shale in the global market \u2014 not just how much of it there is, but how short-cycle it is and how quickly it can respond to market changes,\u201d when speaking on the same energy panel on Monday.', 'Saudi Arabia\u2019s Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said that while OPEC kept a close eye on U.S. shale oil inventories, he was more concerned that producers worked together so the energy market ecosystem was not undermined.', '\u201cWe\u2019re not focused on shale oil particularly. I\u2019d hate to see our endeavor and work in OPEC being challenged by any producer, because at the end of the day we are supporting the industry and we are supporting all producers and we\u2019re welcoming everybody, as long as they are efficient producers,\u201d he said.', 'Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods, who was also on the panel, believed that the challenge that he saw on the supply side of the market was the ability of oil producers to produce efficiently despite volatility in the market.', '\u201cDemand will continue to grow in the decades to come because of the important role that energy and oil and gas plays in modern life \u2026 from a supply standpoint, this industry goes through lots of cycles \u2026 (one of) which is the shale revolution and the supply that came with that, so we\u2019re going to see ups and downs,\u201d he said.', '\u201cIn the period we find ourselves today with ample supply, the challenge is to make sure you can produce this supply at the lowest cost and that you\u2019re competitive, irrespective of where the volatility in any one year takes you. Certainly, from our perspective, that\u2019s how we think about the business.\u201d', '\u201cOur perspective today is that the fundamentals are strong, the demand will be there over time so we have to invest so that we\u2019re in a position to meet that demand,\u201d he added.', '\\nSource: CNBC']"

    "title": "Energy Sector Predictions For 2020",
    "content": "['We begin 2020 with the stock market again testing record highs. We just finished a year in which oil prices rose by more than 30%. However, natural gas prices closed the year nearly 40% lower, emphasizing the extent to which these two commodities have become unlinked.', 'It\u2019s also an election year. Those tend to inject additional unpredictability into the markets, as short-term decisions are often made to influence voters (e.g., releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to drive gasoline prices lower).', 'Against this backdrop, it\u2019s harder for me to get a clear handle on the trends in the energy markets this year. Nevertheless, there are some disconnects in the market that I believe are likely to correct this year. I believe there are some high probability predictions we can make based on those disconnects.', 'Below are my predictions for some of the significant energy trends I expect this year. As I usually point out, the discussion behind the predictions is more important than the predictions themselves. That\u2019s why I provide extensive background and reasoning behind the predictions.', 'I also make predictions that are specific and measurable. At year\u2019s end, there are specific metrics that will indicate whether a prediction was right or wrong.', '1. For the first time since 2014, the closing price of WTI will not drop below $50/bbl', 'Oil is still the world\u2019s most important commodity, so I always try to lead off with a prediction on the direction of oil prices. I generally make this prediction by looking at supply and demand trends, as well as inventory levels. I also usually do a sanity check of my prediction by reviewing predictions from other analysts.', 'Over the past few years, we started the year with an oil price that I felt was too low. So my prediction in recent years was for higher prices. This year, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) opened at $61.17 per barrel (bbl), and averaged $56.98/bbl for the year. The year has only started above $60/bbl one other time since the downturn of 2014-2015. In 2018 the year opened at $60.37/bbl, and it ran up to just over $75/bbl before ending the year below $50/bbl.', 'The Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects crude oil prices to be lower on average this year, because of forecast rising global oil inventories in the first half of 2020.', 'In contrast, JP Morgan is projecting an oil market deficit this year of 200,000 BPD, because of OPEC production cuts and demand growth in emerging markets. They expect oil demand to grow by 1 million BPD globally, which is consistent with most other forecasts.', 'U.S. crude oil inventories are about average for this time of year. Global inventories are slightly below the five-year average.', 'I believe there is a disconnect in the oil market between expectations and reality. There are lots of expectations that we are on the cusp of peak oil demand, but in reality I think we are still several years from that. Nevertheless, those expectations are creating headwinds for oil prices. But the only way the market corrects those expectations is for crude inventories to decline. Given the strong growth in U.S. shale oil in recent years, that just hasn\u2019t happened.', 'That\u2019s a lot of verbiage to set up the prediction, but there are a lot of moving parts here. Ultimately, I believe OPEC will continue to cut production in order to prop up oil prices. I think U.S. shale production growth is going to continue to slow (next prediction), and that global oil demand will once again growth to a new record high.', 'But the oil markets looks to be pretty balanced this year on average. That argues for modest oil price movements. In any case, crude inventories aren\u2019t high, and I believe OPEC will continue to cut production in order to prop up oil prices.', 'Some have called for oil prices to imminently collapse in the face of peak oil demand. I don\u2019t believe prices will go much lower than they are presently in 2020. In fact, for the first time since 2014, I don\u2019t believe they will drop below $50/bbl.', '2. U.S. oil production growth will fall below 1.0 million BPD', 'According to the EIA, U.S. oil production closed 2019 at 12.9 million BPD. For all of 2019, production averaged 12.2 million BPD. To put that in perspective, that\u2019s a higher production rate for crude oil than any other country has ever had.', 'But production growth in 2019 \u2014 1.2 million BPD year-over-year \u2014 was significantly less than 2018\u2019s record 1.6 million BPD gain. And there is a lot more pressure on oil companies to deliver cash flow to investors. That is going to increase the incentive to focus on producing instead of drilling new wells.', 'Thus, I think shale production growth will fall below 1.0 million BPD this year versus last year. That\u2019s also supportive of the previous prediction.', '3. The average natural gas price will be at the lowest level in more than 20 years.', 'Last year I passed on making a natural gas prediction, because I saw too much uncertainty in the market. What ultimately happened was a steady decline in natural gas prices, which dropped below $2.00/MMBtu by the end of the year. The average price for 2019 was $2.56/MMBtu. That\u2019s not much above the $2.52/MMBtu price recorded in 2016, which represented the lowest price since 1999.', 'The problem with the natural gas markets is similar to the problem in the oil market. Demand growth has been strong, but supply growth has been much stronger. And natural gas can\u2019t be transported as easily as oil, so prices have been hit even harder.', 'Natural gas production growth flattened in 2016 in response to low prices. The same thing is likely to happen in 2020 as a result of low prices. But production growth was extremely strong in 2019, and that momentum will carry over into early 2020. That means prices will remain under pressure for a while.', 'Another important piece of the puzzle is natural gas inventories, but those are average for this time of year. Thus, I don\u2019t see prices bouncing back as they did in 2017 and 2018. I think it\u2019s likely that we see another year of depressed natural gas prices. In fact, I believe this year they will drop below the 2016 average price, which would mark the lowest level in more than 20 years.', '4. On average, the U.S. will be a net exporter of crude oil plus finished products for the first time', 'In 2018, Bloomberg reported that the U.S. had become a net crude oil exporter for the first time in 75 years. That was inaccurate. It was actually for the sum of crude oil exports and finished products, and that was for only one week.', 'In September 2019, that feat was achieved on a monthly basis for the first time. However, the average for the year through October still showed the U.S. to be a net importer to the tune of 755,000 BPD.', 'In 2020, I predict the net import number will be switched to a net export number for the year overall. There are likely to be months that are still in the net import category, but I think the year overall will switch into the net export category. To be clear, the U.S. will remain a net importer of crude oil in 2020. If that picture changes, it won\u2019t do so for at least a couple more years.', '5. ConocoPhillips will have a total return of at least 20%', 'Oil prices rose by more than 30% last year. But ConocoPhillips \u2014 the world\u2019s largest publicly traded, pure oil and gas producer \u2014 had a total return of 6.6%. That might be reasonable if COP had a bad year. But it didn\u2019t.', 'Since the deep downturn in 2015, the company has increased cash flow each year. In fact, today ConocoPhillips is generating more cash flow with oil prices in the $50s than it was in 2013 when oil prices were over $100.', 'Net debt is a quarter of what it was just three years ago, but the company\u2019s oil and gas resource that breaks even at a $40 WTI price has increased by 50%.', 'Over the next decade, the company projects a total return to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks of $50 billion. This is substantial, given the current market cap of $65 billion.', 'I expect the market to recognize COP\u2019s value in 2020, and for the company to return at least 20% for the year.', 'There you have my 2020 energy sector predictions. This year is challenging to read because there are so many important variables in motion. But as always, I will grade them at the end of the year.', '\\nSource: Forbes']"

    "title": "The real price of Occidental\u2019s \u2018costless\u2019 oil hedge",
    "content": "['In just 12 days, Occidental Petroleum Corp pulled off one of the biggest hedges against falling oil prices ever placed by a U.S. energy company. It characterized the transaction as \u201ccostless\u201d but a Reuters review of regulatory filings, market data and interviews shows that\u2019s not the whole story.', 'The aim of the complex financial maneuver, the company said, was to help preserve Occidental\u2019s generous dividend to shareholders as it sought to take over rival Anadarko Petroleum for $38 billion last summer in the biggest industry deal for years.', '\u201cWith the additional leverage from the Anadarko acquisition, these new hedges will strengthen our 2020 cash flow in a low oil price environment, and provide additional assurance that our dividend is safe, while we are deleveraging,\u201d Occidental\u2019s Chief Financial Officer Cedric Burgher told an earnings call in August.', 'However, to secure the hedge swiftly and discreetly and to avoid paying its bankers a fee for arranging it, the company took a bigger potential hit to future revenues with only limited protection against falling oil prices, according to a source with direct knowledge of the transaction.', 'While Occidental disclosed the financial details of the hedge in filings, fulfilling its regulatory obligations, the fact that the company took on the additional risk to secure the transaction fast and to avoid banker fees has not been previously reported.', 'Occidental declined to comment for this story.', 'Hedges are used by a variety of companies. Airlines use them to protect against rising fuel prices and energy producers use them to lock in revenue, usually by buying a put option, a type of derivative contract, which gives them the right to sell oil at a predetermined future price.', 'Occidental used a complex series of transactions for its hedge, which was arranged by Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citigroup, according to six sources with direct knowledge of the trades. The summer hedge covered nearly 110 million barrels of oil, or 300,000 barrels a day, each for 2020 and 2021, nearly enough to meet the annual oil imports of Australia.', 'Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citigroup declined to comment.', 'The hedge meant the firm could sell the oil at a minimum of $55 a barrel in 2020, even if crude prices fell below that, to a limit of $45 a barrel; but the company\u2019s selling price was capped at $74.09, and it would lose out on any revenue earned from oil prices rising beyond that mark.', 'Occidental capped revenues for 2020 and also 2021 but only got downside protection for 2020 \u2013 a lopsided deal sometimes referred to as a naked hedge. Limiting future revenue without getting a guarantee against falling prices is unusual in the energy sector.', 'While Occidental has disclosed the details of the 2020 hedge in regulatory filings, the absence of a hedge against falling oil prices in 2021 was not explicitly mentioned. The company said the 2021 options were meant to increase the maximum selling price it would receive for 2020 sales.', '\u201cOccidental entered into the 2021 call options to substantially improve the ceiling price that the Company will receive for the contracted commodity volumes in 2020,\u201d it said in a filing.', 'Some analysts said investors should have been given more information about the potential implications of the hedge.', '\u201cIt seems very strange that they left a naked hedge in 2021 which capped upside but offered no downside protection,\u201d said David Katz, president and CIO of Matrix Asset Advisors, which owns 0.3% of Occidental\u2019s shares.', 'However, other analysts said Occidental needed to secure a hedge quickly to defuse some of the pressure from investors.', '\u201cDoing this gives Oxy a lot of flexibility in 2020 with cash flow,\u201d said Trisha Curtis, President of PetroNerds, an energy analytics and advisory firm specializing in U.S. shale.', '\u201cYou can\u2019t have an acquisition that big and then willy-nilly hope that oil prices hold up. Regardless of what it cost them, it was needed for a number of reasons.\u201d', 'REVENUE-LIMITING OPTIONS', 'Occidental has said publicly that it does not regularly hedge its oil sales because it does not want to give up potential revenue. The last time the company hedged was in 2005, also following an acquisition.', 'In the summer of 2019, Occidental was under pressure to demonstrate that its dividend was being protected.', 'Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn was campaigning against the Anadarko deal and Anadarko itself had issued a regulatory filing on July 29 saying its calculations showed that Occidental, even without an acquisition, would not be able to generate enough cash to pay its dividend for the next three years.', 'Occidental executives wanted to be able to announce the hedge to reassure investors when they presented second-quarter results on July 31, according to three sources with direct knowledge of the transaction.', 'Bank of America and Citigroup had been advising Occidental on the Anadarko acquisition. Now their traders had about two weeks to complete the hedge.', 'Acting on Occidental\u2019s behalf, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citigroup sold two types of derivative contracts, with the intention of using the proceeds from the sales to fund the purchase of a put option locking in Occidental\u2019s oil revenues at $55 a barrel for 2020, according to the six sources.', 'In illiquid private markets, big transactions are more difficult, and therefore more expensive, to execute. If rival traders get wind of a deal before it is fully executed, they could get in first with their own buy or sell orders, pushing up or down the target price.', 'In the case of Occidental\u2019s hedge, the large volume of oil and the tight time frame to insure it meant the banks were not going to be able to raise enough money from selling derivative contracts for 2020 alone to cover the cost of the hedge, the first source said.', 'To fill the gap and avoid having to present Occidental with a large bill, the banks sold similar revenue-limiting options for 2021, the source said.', 'Selling the 2021 options also increased the amount of money the banks could make because they were selling additional contracts on Occidental\u2019s behalf.', 'Derivatives trades require only minimal disclosure and it is unclear how much of a profit the banks made from the Occidental deal.', 'Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citigroup declined to comment.', 'In the first week of 2020, international oil prices spiked by around 9% to nearly $72 a barrel due to heightened tensions in the Middle East. They have since fallen back to around $65, $2 above the price they are expected to average out at over 2020, according to the most recent Reuters poll.', 'If those expectations pan out, Occidental will not miss out on potential profits, so the bet would work out. On the other hand, if oil prices were to surge again, and remain above $74 a barrel, the cost to Occidental could translate to millions of dollars a month in lost revenues, even at just $1 above the price cap.', 'Despite the hedge underpinning its dividend, Occidental shares have fallen by nearly a third since April, when its interest in Anadarko first became public.', '\\nSource: Reuters (Additional reporting by Imani Moise in New York; Editing by David Gaffen, Greg Roumeliotis and Carmel Crimmins.)']"

    "content": "['The Energy Transition and Extinction Rebellion may have led the energy news agenda and stimulated reflection in many E&P boardrooms in 2019, but the impact on exploration drilling is not yet apparent. The global high impact well[1] count in 2019 was 91 wells, up 36% on 2018. Drilling spend was flat at $3.5 billion, however, as average well costs fell. Discovered commercial volume was the highest since 2015 at around 13 billion barrels of oil equivalent (boe) from the 27 high impact discoveries announced so far. The commercial success rate was at a 10-year high of 32%. This level of activity looks likely to be sustained through 2020.', '77% of total estimated 13bn boe discovered was gas, with seven of the top ten discoveries being gas in Russia (2), Iran, Mauritania, Senegal, Indonesia and Cyprus. The two biggest oil discoveries were both in the Stabroek licence in Guyana, which at 6 billion barrels and counting, is one of the most prolific oil licences ever issued.', '2019 was the year that North West Europe topped the charts for high impact drilling globally. This was extraordinary given the maturity of the plays in the UK and Norway. Unfortunately, and some would say predictably, only two high impact discoveries resulted from the 27 well programme \u2013 Glengorm in the UK and Liat\u00e5rnet in Norway. This is a woeful success rate of only 7%. Two wells are still drilling and could yet deliver discoveries, but the low discovery rate should cause pause for thought and the high impact well count should drop in 2020.', 'Guyana topped the oil discovery charts again in 2019 with the Liza field coming onstream in December and another billion barrels added in the Exxon operated Stabroek licence with some more gas also. The five commercial discoveries in 2019 bring the total so far to 14 but it wasn\u2019t all plain sailing. The Tullow operated JV made two play opening discoveries that first sounded promising but turned out to be heavy and sour, contributing to a dramatic fall from grace for Tullow with its share price crashing.', 'Already the oil volume discovered and planned for development is far more than the tiny economy of Guyana can handle and the pace may have to slow 2020 if Guyana is to cope. There is still much to learn about both the plumbing of the petroleum system and the robustness of the political system \u2013 expect more surprises. The industry will nonetheless continue to try to push the boundaries of the play beyond the Stabroek licence into both shallower and deeper Guyanese waters. The significant Maka Central discovery operated by Apache and announced in January 2020 looks to be the first commercial discovery outside of Stabroek, extending the play into neighbouring Suriname.', 'In Mexico, the 5 high impact exploration wells completed by international oil companies in 2019 failed to deliver a commercial discovery (with one still drilling). In 2020 it should become clearer whether Mexico will deliver the bounty that IOCs hoped for with at least 10 wells operated by seven different IOCs testing over 2.5 billion barrels of unrisked prospective volume in a range of frontier and emerging plays. The geology is complex and mixed results can be expected.', 'Brazil is another country to watch in 2020 with one high impact well currently drilling and seven wells planned for 2020 in recently awarded licences testing 6 billion barrels of unrisked volume in pre-salt plays in the Santos and Campos basins, and the Ceara Basin. Exxon will operate its first two wells since its re-entry and Premier will operate its first well in the Ceara Basin. It\u2019s not going to be shooting fish in a barrel in the Santos Basin though with several wells being drilled outside the proven pre-salt play. The much anticipated Peroba well drilled in 2019 by BP, for which a $598 million signature bonus was paid in the 2017 bid round, is understood to have found high CO2 content gas and is considered non-commercial.', 'In Africa, high impact drilling remained subdued at 14 wells completed in 2019 but commercial success rates were high at 57% with over 3 billion boe discovered of which ~80% was gas. There was one frontier play opening gas condensate discovery at Brulpadda in South Africa and there were high impact discoveries in five other countries \u2013 Senegal, Mauritania, Nigeria, Angola and Ghana. In 2020, a similar number of high impact wells are expected spread across 10 countries with potentially six frontier play tests in Guinea Bissau, Kenya, Namibia and Gabon. Total is testing a new play concept at a well in Block 48, Congo Basin Angola, notable for being the deepest water exploration well ever at over 3600m.', 'In the emerging gas plays of the Eastern Mediterranean there were six wells drilled and two commercial discoveries delivering 5 tcf. Three of the six wells were drilled by TPAO, two of which were in the Cyprus area and were political rather than technical tests. Five wells testing 16 tcf of gas are planned in 2020 including Total\u2019s Byblos-1 well offshore Lebanon.', 'Drilling in Australasia is set to pick up in 2020 after a quiet 2019 with one potentially high impact gas discovery made in the onshore Perth Basin at the West Ereggulla well. In 2020 high impact drilling is mainly about gas with wells planned in Australia, New Zealand, PNG and Timor Leste testing over 10 tcf of gas most of which are testing frontier plays. South East Asia was quiet in 2019 with just three high impact wells and two high impact discoveries in Indonesia and Malaysia discovering 5 tcf of gas.', 'Based on current plans it looks like high impact drilling could be at a similar level in 2020 but with shift of focus to North and South America. Westwood estimates that industry drilling plans are weighted 70/30 oil to gas. Whilst recognising that the industry has had a habit of finding gas when looking for oil it doesn\u2019t seem the appetite for finding oil is diminishing. The four most active companies in 2020 are expected to be the European Supermajors Total, Equinor, Shell and ENI, each participating in 14 or more high impact wells. Whilst there has been much talk about the energy transition in 2019, there is little sign of its impact on exploration plans for 2020.', '\\nSource: Westwood Energy']"

Tehran intentionally avoided targeting areas with Americans, CNN reported, quoting several Trump administration officials. The resolution adopted by the Iraqi parliament asking all foreign forces to leave the country provided some consolation to Iran. This may have helped Tehran to take only a symbolic action against Washington in the ongoing war of nerves.', 'The message was clear on the US too. President Donald Trump\u2019s speech after the missile attacks signalled easing of tensions. It increasingly became obvious that both Tehran and Washington wanted to scale down the temperature. Hence, rather than signaling a military response to the Iranian missile attacks, Trump vowed to impose new sanctions on Iran.', 'Crude markets took the cue, tumbling 4 per cent, in a go. In a dramatic pullback from the high of $65.65 late Tuesday, after Iran lobbed missiles on US military bases in Iraq, crude dipped. Oil headed for its first weekly loss since November last year.', 'Oil futures too fell sharply on Wednesday, logging lowest settlement since mid-December.', 'In the meantime, the US House of Representatives also voted on Thursday to limit President Trump\u2019s authority to strike Iran. America received indications that the Islamic Republic has asked pro-Iran militias in the Middle East not to carry out attacks against US interests, Vice President Mike Pence said in comments to Fox.', 'The prospects of a supply disruption from the Middle East were clearly receding.', 'Data from the US Energy Information Administration also helped the crude markets ease further. During the week ending January 3, US crude supplies went up by 1.2 million barrels.', 'However, until then, crude markets remained in flux, reacting to virtually every move. Confusion was ruling. Prospects of war had already pushed oil prices to a seven-month high. The tone and tenor of Washington were enough to keep the crude markets rattled. The US was throwing around wild threats, and not just towards Iran, but also Iraq, after its Parliament passed the resolution urging the United States to leave the country.', 'In a sharp reaction to the resolution, Trump vowed to hit Iraq with penalties \u201clike they\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d if American troops were forced out on an unfriendly basis. \u201cIt\u2019ll make Iranian sanctions look somewhat tame,\u201d the president told reporters aboard Air Force One.', 'Interestingly, in a chaotic afternoon in Washington last Monday, the US denied it was pulling its forces out of Iraq after a leaked letter to the effect, apparently from the top US general in Baghdad to his Iraqi counterpart, emerged. This added to the confusion. Washington denied. \u201cThere\u2019s been no decision whatsoever to leave Iraq,\u201d Mark Esper, the US defence secretary said later.', 'Although how the Iraqi parliament resolution could be implemented remains a mystery. Yet, one thing was certain: For Washington to isolate Iraq could have caused further upheaval in the crude markets.', 'Iraq is the second-largest oil producer within the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec), behind only Saudi Arabia.

In the prevailing scenario, markets were in no position to overlook these numbers.', 'Sidelining Iraq\u2019s output could have exacerbated fears of a supply shock that was already in play after General Soleimani was assassinated. Prices could have spiked, analysts underlined. \u201cIf there were Iran-style sanctions that made Iraq\u2019s oil toxic to the rest of the world, that could have driven prices up quite sharply,\u201d Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group was quoted as saying.', 'In an election year, Washington couldn\u2019t have afforded higher prices at gas stations. \u201cPresident Trump is clearly bound by the election dynamics to ensure the markets are supported and the economy does not suffer an oil shock,\u201d Matt Gertken, a geopolitical strategist at BCA Research was quoted as saying.', 'Tom Kloza of the Oil Price Information Service doubted \u2018the president will tolerate $70-plus crude or $3-plus gasoline in red states\u2019.

    "content": "['Following the assassination of Soleimani, Saudi Aramco\u2019s share price fell to SR34.2 on 8 January;', 'Richard Thompson, Editorial Director at GlobalData, a leading data and analytics company, provides his view:', '\u201cThere are two primary factors behind the volatility in the Aramco share price. The most obvious is the heightening of regional geopolitical tensions since Soleimani\u2019s killing by the US. The second relates to a prolonged period of subdued oil demand in the global energy markets, led by the protracted US-China trade war.', '\u201cFollowing the Soleimani killing, global oil prices surged 3-4% on fears of war in the region and long-term disruption to Middle East oil supplies. Share prices of international oil companies such as BP, Shell and ExxonMobil also jumped. The fact that Aramco shares fell when concerns about disruption to oil supplies should have seen them rise confirms that geopolitical issues will be an ongoing and significant factor in the way investors look at not just Saudi Aramco, but all Saudi companies. Indeed, that is the way the markets look at all companies with major exposure to the region.', 'As with the Aramco IPO process, which saw international investors unwilling to accept Riyadh\u2019s valuation of Saudi Arabia\u2019s national oil company, this is deeply frustrating for Riyadh. The kingdom has rightly targeted a much higher valuation for its prime national asset, which is the world\u2019s biggest producer of oil, but it is almost powerless to control the investment risk that comes from the geopolitics of the region.', '\u201cIn trying to understand the recent movements in Aramco\u2019s share price, we must allow for the fact that Aramco shares were launched for the first time on 11 December. Immediately following the IPO, Aramco\u2019s share price was boosted by a combination of local enthusiasm to invest in the region\u2019s most important company, Riyadh\u2019s aggressive promotion of the IPO, and by the extension of the Opec+ alliance\u2019s production cuts in early December, which lifted oil prices.', '\u201cHowever, with the structural picture suggesting that an underlying equation of weak crude demand and oversupply of oil is set to continue to impede oil prices in 2020, it was always likely that we would see the Aramco share price fall back from its initial surge. The Soleimani attack has accelerated that.\u201d', '\\nSource: GlobalData']"

    "title": "What Changed Energy Markets In The 2010s?",
    "content": "['The 2010s saw a seismic shift across the energy sector. This week, Wood Mackenzie\u2019s analysts identify five major themes and trends, from the U.S. energy resurgence to geopolitical tension and an awakening to climate change, which changed the industry forever.', '1. US energy resurgence: Commercial exploitation of US tight oil changed energy markets and upstream strategies. The technology breakthrough may have come the prior decade, but fracking tight oil came of age in the 2010s. Cheap money poured into half a dozen plays, rejuvenating a moribund domestic sector. U.S. international oil companies focused on international business development pivoted back home in search of lower risk growth. U.S. liquids production increased by 10 million barrels per day (b/d) from 2010, mostly in tight oil, reaching a record 18 million b/d by end-2019. The US lifted its crude export ban in 2015.', 'New U.S. volumes added 10% to global oil supply, undermining price and crude price differentials. OPEC ultimately was forced to shift strategy, embracing non-OPEC producers, notably Russia, to cut production and protect price. Some OPEC economies need in excess of US$80/bbl Brent to balance budgets.', 'Shale gas and, latterly, huge volumes of low-cost Permian gas drove the Henry Hub price down. Gas squeezed coal out of the power mix and spawned multiple U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) export projects, which are starting to disrupt the global LNG market. Rising ethane production sparked a renaissance in U.S. petrochemicals.', '2. Intensifying geopolitical tension: Emboldened by the prospect of energy self-sufficiency, the U.S. flexed its muscles across a wide range of foreign policy issues affecting energy markets \u2013 especially after the 2016 election. First, in 2014, the U.S. (with the EU) imposed sanctions on Russia following the invasion of Crimea. Second, in 2017, President Trump announced the U.S. exit from the Paris Agreement of 2015, spurning the global climate change deal that needs both multi-lateral co-operation and leadership from the world\u2019s biggest economy to succeed. Third, the U.S. trade dispute with China beginning in 2018 led to slower global economic growth and energy demand. Fourth, that same year, the US pulled out of the Iran nuclear agreement.', 'Global liquids supply outages \u2013 a blunt measure of geopolitical tension \u2013 rose exponentially from under 1 million b/d in 2010 to over 5 million b/d by 2019, 5% of demand. Some 2 million b/d is directly due to U.S. export sanctions on Iran and Venezuela imposed in the last three years.', '3. The last cost cycle: Upstream costs blew out early in the decade. With oil prices rising but service sector capacity tightening, the industry lost discipline as it strove to develop a clutch of mega-projects. All that changed in 2014. Brent plunged, and the industry had to recalibrate for lower-for-longer prices to survive.', 'Majors turned to downstream for answers \u2013 to a refining management experienced in \u2018managing for margin\u2019 after a lengthy down-cycle. The strategy was back-to-basics: cutting costs and tightening capital discipline; releasing capital from non-core assets and concentrating portfolios around advantaged positions; re-engineering future projects to reduce costs; and executing projects faster to bring forward cash generation. Upstream E&P spend today is 40% below the 2014 peak but with spare capacity in the service sector there\u2019s more bang for buck. Corporate cash flow breakevens in 2020 should average US$55/bbl (Brent), down from US$95/bbl in 2014. The 2010s may have seen the last global cost squeeze; as we enter the 2020s, the outlook for oil and gas supply is plentiful while the risks to longer term demand from the energy transition are growing.', '4. An awakening to climate change: Zero-carbon technologies entered the mainstream. Power generation from solar and wind shifted from subsidized luxury in developed economies to cost-competitive disruptor as costs plummeted. Renewables, awarded through competitive tender or, increasingly, as merchant operators, now dominate new build capacity in power markets. Electric vehicles, energy storage and other grid-edge technologies are at an earlier stage of commercialisation but signal the coming seismic change. Policy is gathering momentum, the IMO regulation to limit sulphur emissions in shipping just one example.', 'Capital markets started to withdraw finance, reflecting changing public perception \u2013 the energy sector\u2019s weighting in the S&P500 halved from 2010 and is now just 5% of the index. Corporate strategies began to shift, with leading IOCs leaning towards lower carbon intensity gas production and establishing new energy businesses to invest in zero-carbon assets. Saudi Aramco\u2019s IPO in December 2019 indicates changing attitudes among fossil-fuel-dependent economies to the future energy mix.', '5. Unknown unknowns: Planning and expected trends can be shattered in a moment by unexpected events. Two stand out. The Macondo blowout in 2010 was one, with lasting lessons learned about health and safety and operating in a frontier environment. Despite the disaster, deepwater oil and gas production increased by 50% to 10 million b/d in the decade. Fukushima in 2011 was another. The resultant closure of Japan\u2019s entire nuclear fleet drove up demand (and prices) for coal, gas and oil as utilities resorted to alternative fuels. As well as prompting Japan to review its long-term energy security, the risks exposed by the accident continue to undermine confidence in nuclear, even with its zero-carbon credentials.', '\\nSource: Wood Mackenzie']"

    "content": "['The dramatic jump in productivity seen in the early days of the US shale oil boom may be waning, but is likely not over, according to analysts, who expect efficiencies, at least for some plays, to edge higher in 2020.', 'While productivity is expected to climb, drilling has slowed, and thus shale production gains are expected to slow. In the Delaware Basin in West Texas, for instance, S&P Global Platts Analytics expects crude output to average 1.5 million b/d in December 2020, up 15% on the year. That\u2019s down from a 16% gain in December 2019, and a 57% gain in December 2018.', 'Wells have become increasingly larger as E&P companies have drilled longer laterals, or horizontal legs, and used more proppant \u2013 sand and/or water that keep fractures open and facilitate oil and gas flow to the surface.', 'But in some places, operators are beginning to push up against the limits of how much shale they can deliver without some startling new technology breakthrough, experts say.', 'Some claim productivity has even taken a step backwards, at least in some areas.', 'In some areas, \u201cwe\u2019re actually seeing productivity degradation,\u201d Sarp Ozkan, director of energy analytics for Enverus, formerly known as DrillingInfo, said.', 'As the industry moved from testing to development mode in the oil patch, the biggest challenge was how to extract the most oil from each well. That was particularly true in the Permian Basin of West Texas/New Mexico where at least a dozen geological subsurface horizons exist, each requiring a unique recipe to maximize oil yields.', 'In 2014, operators were forced to innovate rapidly to combat a sharp drop in oil prices from $100/b to barely half that level by year-end.', 'Since then, the industry experienced a \u201cconsiderable jump\u201d of about 50% higher initial well production (IP) rates, especially in the Permian, Ozkan said', 'Previously, companies drilled one or two wells on a unit to satisfy leasing terms, with superior results. At the same time, to boost economics, operators tried to fit the most wells into the least amount of acreage, called downspacing.', 'But returning to a site with just a few wells and later drilling six or a dozen wells much closer together on it may make the new wells \u201ca lot less productive,\u201d said Ozkan.', '\u2018A FINITE MILKSHAKE\u2019', '\\n\u201cIt\u2019s like they\u2019re sucking a finite milkshake,\u201d he added. \u201cWhen you put more straws in the cup, each straw starts competing for more milk\u201d \u2013 that is, each well struggles to rake in more oil than the offset wells nearby, he said.', 'That has caused some plays such as the STACK in Oklahoma to show year-over-year productivity degradation. For example, Concho Resources said in October its Permian big Dominator project did not meet earlier expectations because of too-tight spacing between wells.', 'Laredo Petroleum told investors about a year ago it had begun upspacing Permian wells at its Yellow Rose project \u2014 placing wells farther apart, not closer together. By August, Yellow Rose had outperformed a tightly-spaced offset well package for cumulative oil per foot by more than 30%, Jason Pigott, then Laredo president and now CEO, said in a quarterly call that month.', 'Not only did results of wider spacing confirm Laredo\u2019s expectation that 2019 well productivities would show \u201csignificant\u201d increases versus 2018, but also \u201csignificant productivity improvements\u201d versus more tightly spaced offset wells throughout its acreage, Piggot said.', 'As production growth has faded in favor of cash flows, US oil operators dropped rigs throughout the past year. Productivity growth also reduced the need for some rigs.', 'As operators try to squeeze more operational and financial oomph from each dollar spent and study IP rates and decline curves to measure well efficiencies, a simpler metric of production gained per well brought online is also a \u201cpowerful gauge,\u201d S&P Global Platts Analytics analyst Andrew Cooper said.', 'Eagle Ford efficiency has fallen roughly 7% year on year as of the second quarter of 2019, according to Cooper. The Delaware play in Texas was down 5% over the same period, although efficiencies in the Delaware New Mexico play were up 23% using the same metrics, Cooper said.', '\u201c[Those figures show] why operators are flocking to the western half of the Permian,\u201d Cooper said.', 'PERMIAN, BAKKEN EFFICIENCIES STILL RISING', '\\nMoreover, improvements, at least in the Permian and Bakken Shale of North Dakota where efficiencies are still rising, will continue for at least another year.', '\u201cLikely in 2021-2022 we will see efficiencies or production per well stabilize and flatten due to limited core acreage remaining,\u201d he said.', 'On the other hand, what\u2019s happening with shale productivity often lies in the definition, Anexandre Ramos-Peon, senior analyst for shale at Rystad Energy, said.', '\u201cThe classical way to define it is production \u2026 in the first two to three months,\u201d Ramos-Peon said. But since some operators really \u201ccherry pick\u201d the way they represent their production. Some release outputs of the first 24 hours or 30 days, so reported numbers are not comparative.', 'Also, some operators deliberately cut back peak output to produce more down the road. And well laterals, or horizontal legs, are getting longer \u2014 from about 5,000 or 6,000 feet in 2014, to 9,000 or 10,000 feet currently \u2014 and thus reap more oil per well.', 'Ramos-Peon conceded many Eagle Ford wells have not been as good as before. But oil prices are lower too \u2013 around $56.44/b in Q3 2019 versus $69.43/b in Q3 2018, so operators might target different areas away from the sweet spots, unwilling to produce their best oil into a lower-priced market.', 'Thus, \u201cthere is no one number that fits all sorts of metrics,\u201d Ramos-Peon said. On the other hand, \u201cinitial production rates of 90- and 180 days have kept growing every month.\u201d', 'In October, Rystad in a report said, after studying months of production data, that the average well each month in the Permian was slightly more productive than its counterpart drilled three to six months before.', '\u201cIn the Bakken, Eagle Ford and DJ Basin [in Colorado], well productivity is observed at or close to all-time highs as of 1H 2019,\u201d the report said.', '\\nSource: ', '\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t']"

    "content": "['The global oil market is brimming with a smorgasbord of crudes, from the Canadian tar sands extracted with the help of steam and sand, to the lightest US condensates whose color mirrors a glass of fine white wine.', 'Each crude stream possesses its own unique characteristics, and when refined yields varying proportions of different refined products. Understanding crude quality has never been more important, following the dramatic rise in US shale output, which has transformed the composition of the global oil market.', 'To reflect this change, S&P Global Platts created a periodic table of oil cataloguing 120 of the most important grades on international markets. Here are some of the grades that have recently come to the fore in a turbulent year for the petroleum supply chain.', 'Bakken, US: light sweet', '\\nLight sweets generally trade at a premium to Platts Dated Brent due to their strong yields of gasoline and distillates. Some condensates are priced at a slight discount to Platts Dated Brent because of their high naphtha content.', 'The US crude oil production boom over the past decade has drawn attention to West Texas and its flagship grade WTI. However, the Bakken-Three Forks formations of North Dakota and Wyoming, often lumped together as \u201cBakken,\u201d also produce a significant amount of light sweet crude that makes its way to refineries in the US Midwest and US Gulf Coast, and occasionally into the global market.', 'The field produces almost 1.5 million b/d of Bakken, a light sweet crude that typically has a gravity of between 41-43.7 API and a sulfur content of 0.12%. Its importance in both the domestic and international markets has grown significantly since the startup of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) and its southern leg, the Energy Transfer Crude Oil Pipeline (ETCOP) in June 2017.', 'Together, these form a 570,000 b/d system that moves oil from the Williston Basin up near the US border with Canada, all the way down to the Texas Gulf Coast at Beaumont and Nederland. Bakken trades relative to NYMEX WTI from its point of origin down to the pipeline\u2019s terminus. Along the US Gulf Coast, it averaged around a $4.50/b premium to NYMEX WTI in 2019.', 'Murban (UAE): light sour', '\\nLight sour crudes boast a high fuel oil and gasoil content but are also very high in sulfur. They normally trade at a slight premium to the Platts Dubai sour benchmark.', 'Crudes that are both light in terms of gravity and high in sulfur are a rarity, and Murban \u2013 produced onshore from the Abu Dhabi emirate of the UAE \u2013 is one of the biggest streams of such oil. Due to its burgeoning production and popularity among Asian refiners, Murban is emerging as a key Middle East crude benchmark.', 'Murban crude oil', 'The crude accounts for more than half of UAE production at around 1.6 million b/d on average, and is one of the major streams in the Middle East with a large spot market.', 'The Abu Dhabi National Oil Company and Intercontinental Exchange are set to launch a futures contract for Abu Dhabi\u2019s flagship Murban grade in the first half of 2020.', 'A surge in arbitrage flows into Asia, as well as rising US crude exports, have raised competition for Middle East producers at a time when Asian refiners are striving to diversify their crude sources.', 'Murban is also a deliverable grade in the Platts benchmark Dubai and Oman crude assessment process. At least 40% of Murban onshore production is freely traded, according to industry sources. The grade is exported from Jebel Dhanna and Fujairah.', 'Bonny Light (Nigeria): medium sweet', '\\nMedium sweets are very attractive to both simple and complex refineries due to their high middle distillate yields, and are generally priced at a premium to Platts Dated Brent.', 'Bonny Light is one of the most prized crudes in the world due to its high gasoline content. Produced onshore in Nigeria\u2019s oil-rich Niger Delta, it is very popular with refiners globally. Production has averaged around 250,000 b/d recently.', 'India, the main driver of oil demand growth, is the largest buyer of this Nigerian grade.However, militants in the Niger Delta have caused disruptions to pipelines, regularly targeting the key infrastructure tied to the crude and export flows.', 'Bonny Light crude loadings have been under force majeure on three separate occasions in the past 12 months due to pipeline leaks caused by attacks by militants.', 'Many Nigerian crudes are either light or medium sweet, yielding generous amount of diesel, jet fuel and gasoline, making them more expensive than sour crudes. Crudes like Bonny Light are now competing with US shale, due to the quality similarities, and this has greatly altered the direction of crude flows globally.', 'Arab Light (Saudi Arabia): medium sour', '\\nMedium sour crudes form the staple diet of complex refineries. They generally trade at a discount to Platts Dated Brent but recently prices for some grades have strengthened due to the supply tightness of such crudes globally.', 'Arab Light is the key export grade for Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s largest exporter of crude. This crude is a mainstay of the main Asian refining hubs of China, India, Japan and South Korea, making it very significant for the world oil market.', 'Despite being a high-sulfur crude, it boasts a medium-gravity API, making it a well-rounded grade for refiners to process. When refined it produces a wide variety of products, especially for those with complex processing units.', 'Arab Light is mainly produced from the giant Ghawar and Khurais fields, but it also contains volumes from other fields. The Saudi grades most affected by attacks on the country\u2019s oil infrastructure in September 2019 were Arab Light and Arab Extra Light.', 'The Abqaiq facility, which was damaged in the attacks, helps process Arab Light and also Arab Extra Light. The Abqaiq plant has the ability to depressurize, desulfurize, and de-gas crude production, making it safe for pipeline transport.', 'Doba (Chad): heavy sweet', '\\nHeavy sweets are traditionally priced at a discount to Platts Dated Brent but their popularity has broadened. They became more valuable ahead of the IMO 2020 sulfur cap due to their very low sulfur content.', 'Named after a city in southern Chad where vast amounts of oil was discovered, this crude has emerged as one of the coveted barrels as demand for cleaner fuels grows.', 'Doba\u2019s demand used to be limited to complex refiners due to its extremely acidic profile, but its quality has changed over the years due to new fields Badila and Mangara coming on stream. This change in quality has broadened the customer base for Doba. The crude\u2019s appeal increased sharply ahead of the IMO 2020 sulfur cap due to its fuel oil-rich but low-sulfur content, which makes it an ideal grade for producing marine gasoil.', 'This crude is finding homes in refineries all over the world and has been particularly popular in the storage hubs of Fujairah and Rotterdam, where the crude is processed at topping facilities to make IMO-compliant fuel oil. The price of Doba has risen dramatically as a result.', 'Crude differentials for this grade reached a record high of Dated Brent plus $1.65/b in late September, according to Platts data. Around four years ago, Doba was trading just below Dated Brent minus $8.00/b.', 'Doba production has also risen over the year with production averaging around 150,000 b/d, compared to levels of around 80,000 b/d six years ago. Oil from landlocked Chad is pumped via the Kome-Kribi (Doba) pipeline to the coast of Cameroon, where it loads at a terminal around 10 km offshore.', 'West Canadian Select (Canada): heavy sour', '\\nHeavy sours are popular with complex refineries as they can be tough to refine due to their high sulfur content. They are priced at a significant discount to light crude benchmarks such as Platts Dated Brent or the NYMEX light sweet crude futures contract.', 'As its name implies, Western Canadian Select is a select blend of heavy sour material produced in \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 Western Canada. There is no true production of WCS. Like the US grade WTI, WCS is a blended barrel, meaning its supply is based upon and controlled by the inputs available plus pipeline space and economics.', 'The primary consumers of this heavy sour crude are US Midwest and US Gulf Coast refiners, which have sufficiently complex plants to process it and enjoy the significantly depressed prices at which WCS trades.', 'Why are WCS values so low? Essentially, the crude is land-locked. There is more crude production in Western Canada than there are avenues to export it, which causes its price to fall to levels where rail cars are used to help clear the glut.', 'A shortage of heavy sour crude \u2013 brought on by OPEC+ cuts, declining Mexican output and sanctions on Venezuela and Iran \u2013 has increased the global interest for WCS. However, so far, US Midwest and USGC refiners have maintained a consistent appetite for WCS, preventing large-scale exports.', '\\nSource: ', '\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t']"

It is to enable a proper planning for future capital expenditure to be conducted using predictable parameters rather than projecting numbers in an extreme environment. That said, we understand that most E&P producers are comfortable at the current US$60-US$70pb oil price level as current production costs range from US$30-US$40pb for offshore production while for onshore production, the cost is even lower which will ensure the current upbeat momentum of offshore and onshore activities will be sustained.', 'Hence, looking at the current operating climate we reiterate our view that local O&G service companies involved in drilling, fabrication and vessel providers (floating production storage and offloading [FPSO] and offshore support vessels) will continue to benefit from the upbeat offshore activities going into 2020.

We also like Bumi Armada Bhd (\u201cbuy\u201d; TP: 56 sen) due to its improving operational conditions as well as its position as the largest FPSO provider in Malaysia. We are also favourable towards Dialog Group Bhd (\u201cbuy\u201d; TP: RM3.83) specifically due to its stable recurring income from its tank farm business and due to it being one of the main beneficiaries of the soon-to-be operational Pengerang Integrated Petroleum Complex.', 'For the downstream sub-sector of the O&G industry, we remain positive on Petronas Chemicals Group Bhd (\u201cbuy\u201d; TP: RM8.77), Petronas Dagangan Bhd (\u201cbuy\u201d; TP: RM27.75) and Gas Malaysia Bhd (\u201cbuy\u201d; TP: RM3.11) as despite industry-specific challenges, we opine that demand for downstream products remains robust and that external disruptions are temporary in nature which will not halt the respective companies\u2019 growth going forward.', '\\nSource: The Edge Financial Daily']"

We could also expect President Trump to lean on OPEC allies \u2013 especially swing producer Saudi Arabi \u2013 to increase production should a significant oil disruption take place. Furthermore, higher prices send signals to nimble marginal producers like US shale operators to increase production. More oil in circulation means more insulation against sudden output shortages.', '\u00b7 Those who bet on sustained oil price increases in the wake of geopolitical crises lost out in 2019.

If the Abqaiq attacks didn\u2019t result in a prolonged oil price increase, what sort of event could?', '\u00b7 We\u2019ll have calm in the short term. Iran\u2019s Suleimani revenge attack against Iraqi bases housing US personnel resulted in no American casualties and minimal infrastructure damage. There are reports that the Iran informed Iraq of the missile attack some 6 hours prior, with a further leak to the U.S., giving time for troops to evacuate. In the strange world of escalation and deterrence, this is was an \u201colive branch\u201d attack, which Trump appears to have accepted \u2013 responding only with sanctions and strong words rather than a military option. Trump does not seem interested in a war.', 'Looking Ahead', 'For the moment, market jitters from the US-Iran standoff have been short-lived. Iran seems to have achieved the right balance in its response, simultaneously responding forcefully to the death of Maj. Gen. Suleimani without provoking a massive US military retaliation. But it would be naive to consider Iran\u2019s reprisal as fully-over.', 'Tehran is known for its low-intensity and long-term strategic thinking, as it cannot hope to stand toe-to-toe military against the United States and her allies. We can expect Iran to continue its response over the coming weeks, months and years in its trademark asymmetric fashion. Its actions may look familiar, including missile strikes and tanker hijackings, but could also include more disruptive tactics including cyber warfare and proxy attacks through terrorist groups such as Hezbollah against U.S. allies across the Middle East.', 'This is explains why the Saudis have temporarily suspended operations of their largest government owned shipping company \u2013 Bahri \u2013 through the Strait of Hormuz. They are rightfully concerned that Tehran\u2019s retaliatory actions are just beginning.', 'In the event of a supply disruption, there are some 2 million barrels per day of spare capacity that could potentially come online from the world\u2019s troubled oil producing regions like Venezuela, Libya, and Russia. All of them are under sanctions or amidst a major civil conflict. Increased prices caused by a supply shortage could provide the financial incentive for additional production to be brought online.', 'While markets remain subdued at present, any Iranian action that evokes a major military response from the United states \u2013 be it a closure of the Strait of Hormuz (where 20% of oil supplies transit daily) or the harming of US assets \u2013 could push crude prices above $70 and beyond. Global markets have to some extent become hardened to geopolitical crises. But we have just entered a new and unknown phase of the US-Iran confrontation that started in 1979, and no eventuality can be ruled out.', '\\nSource: Forbes']"

Domestic West Texas intermediate (CL=F) posted a weekly decline of more than 6% to $59.04 a barrel, representing the largest weekly drop since July.', 'The declines more than reversed momentary spikes in both Brent and WTI crude prices last week, when concerns that Iran might retaliate with a hit to Middle East oil infrastructure sent investors scrambling to price in a supply risk premium.', 'But that quick reversal in price action may have been premature, according to Dicker.', '\u201cI think that traders ultimately may get bit in the backside because there\u2019s such passivity to geopolitical risk,\u201d Dicker told Yahoo Finance\u2019s The Final Round. \u201cI was biting my fingernails \u2013 maybe a lot of people were \u2013 that, you know, in fact, if there were casualties from the reprisal strike from the Iranians that Trump might, you know, puff his chest out and toss a bomb at Tehran and we\u2019d be in the middle of, you know, a sector-wide war that involved more than just the U.S. and Iran.\u201d', 'Instead, President Donald Trump announced Wednesday that he would be retaliating against Iran with sanctions, rather than escalating a military confrontation. The apparent easing of tensions with Iran sent oil prices down immediately.', '\u201cJust because, you know, a president comes out, you know, the next morning and says, \u2018I\u2019m not going to take a retaliatory move quite yet\u2019 \u2013 I mean, all of a sudden oil drops $3.50,\u201d Dicker said. \u201cThat, to me, is a tremendous change over the way that oil markets used to react to news like this even as much as five years ago and 10 years ago.\u201d', '\u2018They\u2019re momentum seekers\u2019', '\\nA key reason, Dicker said, boils down to who is \u2013 and is no longer \u2013 actually facilitating oil trades. Up until recently, \u201cthere were a lot more humans that were in the pipeline in terms of who was moving the markets, who was putting bets down, who was playing far out on the curve and who wasn\u2019t,\u201d he said.', 'But that dynamic has changed, and so too has oil price action in response to geopolitical shocks.', '\u201cNow we\u2019re swamped by machines, and they\u2019re momentum searchers. And ultimately, you know, when something comes out, no matter what the price is \u2013 whether it\u2019s considered to be bullish news or bearish news \u2013 there seems to be a pile-on factor,\u201d Dicker said.', '\u201cInstead of humans playing the market, there really are machines playing the market,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd yes, we\u2019ve all had to become used to that, because those traders who have been playing the game as if it were, you know, 2010 or 2000 or 1995 have gotten their heads handed to them.\u201d', '\u201cWe\u2019re all kind of forced into this very kind of passive kind of idea about oil prices being unmovable by geopolitics,\u201d Dicker said.', 'That said, many economists have pointed out that this week\u2019s earlier oil price spikes were also capped due to the perception that a Middle East supply shock would do less to hamper overall supply, given an existing supply glut and surging domestic production.', 'A similar phenomenon took place last September, when Brent crude oil prices spiked 15% \u2013 but then quickly receded \u2013 after a drone strike the U.S. blamed on Iran hit Saudi oil infrastructure and temporarily took out about 5% of global daily oil production.', '\u201cNow, if something would actually come out that would actually really put some supply at risk, you\u2019d see markets spike in a way that you\u2019d never see them spike before,\u201d Dicker said.', '\u201cThe machines are so far behind the curve when it comes to this that when some real momentum of real supply issues come up, you\u2019re going to see them spike prices \u2013 not, you know, $10 or $7, but more like $25 or $30.

Anything above $70/b we understand will not be good for the consumer. If we do the evaluation and that [current] price continues, we should be maintaining the deal.\u201d', 'OPEC ministers are largely loathe to comment on prices, for fear of triggering complaints of anti-competitive collusion. In particular, the US Congress has been considering legislation that would allow the US Justice Department to sue OPEC under antitrust law for manipulating oil prices.', 'On Saturday, UAE energy minister Suhail al-Mazrouei focused his OPEC comments at the forum on the bloc\u2019s desire to prevent market volatility.', 'The current round of production cuts is aimed at avoiding a supply glut that many forecasters had predicted for the first quarter of 2020, he said.', '\u201cWe are meeting in March to discuss any measures that we need to do,\u201d Mazrouei said. \u201cThe objective for all of us in OPEC and OPEC+ is not to achieve a certain price.

Equatorial Guinea\u2019s 2020 budget is based on a conservative assumption of $51/b, he said.', 'The West African producer, which Obiang said was currently producing 120,000 b/d of crude, is expecting to boost output by 20,000 b/d by the end of 2020 as new projects at its Aseng and Ceiba fields ramp up and offset declines from its Zafiro and Alba fields. If the OPEC+ cuts are extended beyond March, that increase would put the country over its quota of 122,000 b/d in the OPEC+ deal.', '\u201cWe will have to evaluate what we do,\u201d Obiang said. \u201cIn the meantime, let\u2019s see what happens in March.\u201d', 'EXPANSION PLANS', '\\nThe minister said Equatorial Guinea expects to announce by June which company will take over ExxonMobil\u2019s license in the mature Zafiro field.', 'The American major still has three years left on its contract but is seeking to divest its holdings in the country.', 'Output at the aging field, producing since 1996, has been steadily falling, and Obiang said the new operator will be expected to invest a minimum of $1 billion to stem the decline. He estimated that the field still contains reserves of some 1 billion barrels.', 'ExxonMobil has discovered gas condensates in the south of the field, which could be included in the package that the company plans to divest, Obiang said.', 'Equatorial Guinea also plans to announce in April a new licensing round that will consist of four to five blocks, he added.', 'Meanwhile, construction of two modular oil refineries that will process at least 20,000 b/d each should begin by the end of this year, Obiang said. The facilities will allow the country, which currently has no oil refineries, to meet its own refined product needs and export fuels to its neighbors.', 'A joint venture with Angola on a new refinery in Angola\u2019s Cabinda enclave is also still under consideration, Obiang said.', '\\nSource: ', '\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t']"

    "content": "['\u201cAll the countries in the Gulf region have an interest in keeping the Strait of Hormuz, which sits between Oman and Iran, open as an export route\u201d, says Ed Crooks Vice-Chair, Americas.', 'In this week\u2019s Energy Pulse:', '\\nOil prices spiked after the US killed senior Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike, and after Iran retaliated against US bases in Iraq, but quickly fell back again. The heightened tensions in the Gulf region have focused attention on the risk of disruption to oil tankers passing through the Strait of Hormuz, a critical artery for global supplies, and raised questions over Iraq\u2019s plans for strong growth in its production. In other news, Suriname has emerged as a potential new hot-spot for oil development, Mexico\u2019s president has suggested subsidies to foreign renewables companies could be cut, and the US oil industry group has set out its agenda for the coming year. Plus smart reads on the crisis in the Gulf and its implications for oil and gas, and a fresh perspective on the pace of energy transitions.', 'Back in September, when missiles and drones apparently launched from Iran hit oil processing facilities at Abqaiq and Khurais in Saudi Arabia, crude prices surged immediately before quickly falling back. So far, the oil market\u2019s response to the US killing of Qassem Soleimani, leader of the Quds Force of Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guards, has been very similar. Brent crude briefly spiked over $70 a barrel on Monday, and again early on Wednesday following the Iranian reprisal attack on two US air bases in Iraq. But by Thursday afternoon, oil prices were back down below their levels before the strike on Soleimani. The Wall Street Journal reflected a widely-shared view when it reported that the US and Iran had backed away from open conflict. Tensions in the Gulf region remain high, however, and the Financial Times warned there appeared to be \u201cno end to the hostilities\u201d.', 'The region\u2019s critical vulnerability for global energy supplies is the Strait of Hormuz between Oman and Iran, described by the US Energy Information Administration as \u201cthe world\u2019s most important oil transit chokepoint\u201d. About a fifth of global oil consumption and a quarter of the international trade in liquefied natural gas passed through the strait in 2018, and there has been widespread speculation over whether Iran could try to close it to tanker traffic. That seems unlikely, however: all the countries in the Gulf region have an interest in keeping the Strait open as an export route. Decades of history have shown that even during periods of intense conflict, such as during the \u201cTanker War\u201d of the 1980s, the oil has continued to flow.', 'There has been some disruption to tanker traffic through the strait. Bahri, Saudi Arabia\u2019s national shipping company, has temporarily suspended crossings, according to the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times, and other oil groups and tanker operators are also said to have been restricting movements. But so far there have been no signs of any material disruption to oil supplies. As Michael Wirth, chief executive of Chevron, put it in an interview with CNBC: \u201cI think we\u2019ve been in a well-supplied market for some period of time here, and that\u2019s generally what the view continues to be.\u201d', 'Some of the most significant aftershocks from the killing of Soleimani could play out in Iraq, which has been attempting to remain on good terms with both the US and Iran. US citizens working for foreign oil companies in southern Iraq started leaving the country last Friday, and although there is not expected to be any immediate impact on the country\u2019s oil production, in the longer term the situation could make increasing its output more difficult. Increased tensions and a more distant relationship with the US could hamper the Iraqi oil industry\u2019s growth.', 'The evanescence of the oil price rally over the past week has provided further vindication for US exploration and production company executives who had said they did not expect to step up activity in response to the rise in crude.', 'Scott Sheffield, chief executive of Pioneer Natural Resources, told CNBC: \u201cThe biggest question I am getting at this [Goldman Sachs] conference is: \u2018Are you going to add any rigs because you\u2019ve got another seven, eight dollars a barrel?\u2019 And my answer is no. Everybody\u2019s answer is no. We\u2019re going to give it back to the investor.\u201d', 'The pressure on US oil producers and service companies was shown this week by a series of statements on job cuts, including an unspecified number at Occidental Petroleum following its acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum last year.', '\\nExxonMobil\u2019s discovery of more than 6 billion barrels of oil equivalent off the coast of Guyana has been the most significant exploration success of the past five years. Just before Christmas, the ExxonMobil-led consortium developing the Starbroek block started production from its first wells there, and is on course for its target of producing 750,000 barrels per day by 2025. Now it looks as though neighbouring Suriname may follow Guyana into an oil boom. On Tuesday Apache of the US and Total of France announced a \u201csignificant\u201d oil discovery off the coast of Suriname, with potential for further finds in the same block. WoodMac\u2019s Luiz Hayum and colleagues estimated that the first discovery, named Maka Central, contained 300 million barrels of oil, 150 million barrels of condensate and 1.4 trillion cubic feet of gas. The US Geological Survey in 2012 gave mean estimates for the undiscovered technically recoverable resources of the Guyana-Suriname Basin of 13.6 billion barrels of oil and 21.2 trillion cubic feet of gas.', 'Apache\u2019s share price soared on the news, rising 27% on Tuesday, its largest one-day gain in nearly 50 years. Its success was particularly welcome for Apache following disappointment over its Alpine High shale gas play, first unveiled in 2016. Even after their jump this week, Apache\u2019s shares are still 27% below their level four years ago.', '\\nHouston-based Talos Energy announced this week that a third-party evaluation of its Zama discovery off the coast of Mexico had given a \u201cbest estimate\u201d of its recoverable resources at 670 million barrels of oil equivalent. The field, first discovered in 2017, is the largest exploration success so far for foreign companies since Mexico\u2019s oil industry was opened up by the previous president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, who left office in 2018.', 'His successor, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, often known as Amlo, has a policy of favouring Pemex, the national oil company, and has been restricting sales of exploration and development rights to foreign companies. Reuters reported in September that Pemex was seeking control over the development of Zama.', 'Pemex last month announced its own 500 million barrel discovery at the onshore Quesqui field, but it will take sustained development to reverse the decline in Mexico\u2019s oil production, and Lopez Obrador\u2019s policies have drawn criticism.', 'Foreign investors in renewable energy in Mexico are also facing new challenges. Lopez Obrador said at his regular daily press conference on Wednesday that the authorities would review wind and solar power contracts to see if they offered unjustified subsidies. He said people had been \u201cdeceived for a long time\u201d into thinking that power subsidies helped consumers, when they actually benefited private companies. His announcement fits into his wider strategy of helping CFE, the state-owned electric utility, while making conditions more difficult for foreign power companies.', '\\nThe American Petroleum Institute (API), the influential industry group, launched its annual State of American Energy report, which always gives a good idea of its priorities for the coming year. Timothy Cama of E&E News noted that the API was making \u201can all-out push to paint itself as a climate change champion\u201d, including a subtle shift of emphasis from talking about the \u201coil and gas\u201d industry to describing itself as \u201cnatural gas and oil\u201d. A new video advert from the API makes the point very clearly, arguing: \u201cWe have different perspectives on the best way forward. But on issues that matter, like climate change, we\u2019re more alike than we think.\u201d', 'One key issue for the US industry emerged very clearly: its concern about the threatened \u201cfracking ban\u201d proposed by some Democratic presidential hopefuls including Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Such a ban could cost \u201cup to 7.3 million\u201d jobs in the US, the API warned.', 'In a sign of the mounting pressure on some API members, the world\u2019s largest fund manager Blackrock this week signalled it would step up efforts to persuade companies to address climate-related risks. It joined the Climate Action 100+ group of investors, which works \u201cto ensure the world\u2019s largest corporate greenhouse gas emitters take necessary action on climate change\u201d.', 'The decision was well-timed, whether by accident or design. This week, climate activists launched a new campaign called \u201cStop the money pipeline\u201d, which will encourage customers to take their money out of financial services companies that support the fossil fuel industry. The campaign, which argues that \u201cWall Street is financing climate destruction\u201d, is targeting three institutions in particular: JPMorgan Chase, Liberty Mutual Insurance, and Blackrock.', 'The US gas industry\u2019s claim to be helping the climate fight received some support from the preliminary estimates of US greenhouse gas emissions in 2019 produced by the Rhodium Group, a research firm. Rhodium calculated that, after a sharp uptick in 2018, US emissions fell by 2.1% last year, mostly because of a decline in coal-fired power generation. Gas and renewable generation filled the gap as coal declined, cutting nearly 10% from the US power sector\u2019s emissions, the largest drop in decades. Outside the power sector, meanwhile, emissions rose.', 'An announcement this week confirmed that President Donald Trump is continuing with his strategy of attempting to ease the burden on business from environmental regulations. In an event at the White House on Thursday, Trump talked about his administration\u2019s plans to reform the regulations for implementing the 1969 National Environmental Policy Act. The president said his proposals would \u201cslash job-killing regulations and improve the quality of life for all of our citizens\u201d, making it quicker and cheaper to secure environmental approvals for infrastructure projects. Environmental groups and Democrats attacked the plans: the Natural Resources Defense Council said the proposals if implemented would \u201ccripple the way NEPA is applied to federally approved and funded projects\u201d. In particular, the new rules would limit federal agencies\u2019 ability to take potential impacts on climate change into account in environmental reviews.', 'Among members of Congress, however, there have been further moves aimed at developing a new climate strategy for the US. Democrats on the Energy and Commerce Committee of the House of Representatives published a proposal for legislation intended to cut US greenhouse gas emissions, known as \u201cthe CLEAN Future Act\u201d. It is an ambitious-looking plan, aimed at reaching net zero emissions by 2050, while taking a \u201ctechnology-neutral\u201d approach that would allow a variety of different paths to reach that goal.', 'Meanwhile, Mitt Romney, the senator from Utah who was the Republicans\u2019 presidential nominee in 2012 and has sought to maintain some distance from Trump, tweeted that he had met Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, to discuss \u201cpotential bipartisan solutions to address climate change\u201d. The US Chamber of Commerce, the business lobby group that was a fierce critic of some of the Obama administration\u2019s climate policies, urged the president and Congress to find common ground on \u201c35 bipartisan bills that can help address climate change through innovation and investment\u201d.', 'Another bill from the Democrats on the House Energy and Commerce this week would offer $6 billion in rebates and grants to support investment in electric vehicle charging infrastructure. An important new report from Rocky Mountain Institute analysed the cost of that infrastructure, and argued that there should be a concerted effort in the US to understand and reduce \u201csoft costs\u201d such as permitting and regulatory compliance. Charger installation costs in the US are three to five times the cost of the charger itself.', 'Google has signed a \u201chuge\u201d deal with NV Energy in Nevada to provide 350 megawatts of solar power and up to 280 MW of storage for a new data centre being built outside Las Vegas. Google has been matching its entire annual electricity consumption with renewable energy since 2017.', 'And finally: Meat Loaf, of Bat Out Of Hell fame, this week clashed with teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg, saying she had been \u201cbrainwashed into thinking that there is climate change and there isn\u2019t\u201d. Thunberg responded that the real issues were not about \u201cMeatloaf\u201d or her, but about \u201cscientific facts\u201d. The spat was widely represented as emblematic of the generational divide over the climate issue, but in fact the differences between age groups are not as great as you might think. A poll for CBS News last year found 70% of Americans aged 18-29 agreeing that climate change was a serious problem, compared to 58% of those aged 65 or older.', '\\nSource: Wood Mackenzie']"

The wells will typically be drilled close to existing infrastructure, and in mature areas, as companies look for quicker payback from exploration campaigns.', '\u201cThe exploration renaissance we witnessed in 2019 will continue. While elsewhere globally exploration budgets remain suppressed, we expect to see 60 exploration wells in the North Sea which is flat year-on-year and similar to pre-downturn levels.', '\u201cNorway will see the most activity \u2013 with as many as 40 wells, including up to 10 in the Barents Sea.\u201d', 'In Norway, Equinor, Aker BP and Lundin are the big players.

Most of the increase will come from big fields that started up in 2019: Johan Sverdrup, Mariner and Culzean.', 'Boroujerdi said capital investment across the region should total nearly US$25 billion, roughly in line with last year. Norway will account for two-thirds of that spend.', '\u201cThere will be an uptick in sanctions for projects, with up to 22 FIDs, from 16 different operators, in 2020,\u201d he said.', '\u201cThis correlates to US$15 billion of potential new investment. The supply chain will welcome the boost but not all projects will go ahead. Many have slipped from 2019, or earlier. Financing options will tighten. Projects will not only be scrutinised on economic terms, but on their environmental impact.', '\u201cMost new projects are short-cycle, high-return tie-backs, which will help them over the line.

The Government of India has made impressive progress in recent years in increasing citizens\u2019 access to electricity and clean cooking. It has also successfully implemented a range of energy market reforms and carried out a huge amount of renewable electricity deployment, notably in solar energy.', 'Looking ahead, the government has laid out an ambitious vision to bring secure, affordable and sustainable energy to all its citizens. This in-depth review aims to assist the government in meeting its energy policy objectives by setting out a range of recommendations in each area, with a focus on energy system transformation, energy security and energy affordability. The review also highlights a number of important lessons from the rapid development of India\u2019s energy sector that could help inform the plans of other countries around the world.', 'In partnership with NITI Aayog, the International Energy Agency (IEA) today released the first in-depth review of India\u2019s energy policies.', 'The report highlights the achievements of India\u2019s energy policies and provides recommendations to support the government\u2019s goals of promoting well-functioning energy markets and boosting deployment of renewables.', 'Dr Fatih Birol (Executive Director of the IEA) presented the key findings of the IEA in-depth review of India\u2019s energy policies in New Delhi in the presence of Shri Pralhad Joshi (Minister of Coal), Shri Dharmendra Pradhan (Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas and Minister of Steel), Shri R K Singh (Minister for Power and Renewable Energy), Dr Rajiv Kumar (Vice Chairman, NITI Aayog), Shri Amitabh Kant (CEO of NITI Aayog), key energy secretaries, ambassadors, think tanks and the media.', 'The IEA regularly conducts in-depth reviews of energy policies for its member and association countries. This is the first review carried out for India, which has been an IEA association country since March 2017.', 'Introducing the report, NITI Aayog Special Secretary Shri. R.P. Gupta welcomed and commended the hard work of the IEA and said, \u201cAs India builds on the remarkable growth and development of its energy sector, this in-depth review will help the Government in meeting its energy objectives by setting out a range of recommendations in each energy policy area.\u201d', 'NITI Aayog CEO Kant, who brought up the idea with the IEA to conduct the review, said: \u201cWith clear goals in place, the country is making great strides towards affordable, secure and cleaner energy for all its citizens. India is working hard to move towards its aspirations of transforming the energy sector\u201d', '\u201cThe IEA has the privilege of enjoying a close relationship with India. This first in-depth review of the country\u2019s energy policies illustrates the value of our growing collaboration,\u201d said Dr Birol. \u201cThe energy choices that India makes will be critical for Indian citizens as well as the future of the planet. This was demonstrated at the IEA\u2019s 2019 Ministerial Meeting, which mandated the Agency to start consultations with India for a strategic partnership that could serve as a path to eventual membership, a game-changer for international energy governance.\u201d', 'The IEA report congratulates the Indian government on its outstanding achievements in extending citizens\u2019 access to electricity, affordable efficient lighting and clean cooking in record time through historic schemes like SAUBHAGYA, UJALA and UJJWALA, while pursuing energy market reforms and the swift deployment of renewable technologies. The report highlights the strong growth of renewables in India, which now account for almost 23% of the country\u2019s total installed capacity. The review also found that energy efficiency improvements in India avoided 15% of additional energy demand, oil and gas imports, and air pollution as well as 300 million tonnes of CO2 emissions between 2000 and 2018.', 'India is becoming increasingly influential in global energy trends. The country\u2019s demand for energy is set to double by 2040, and its electricity demand may triple, according to the IEA report. Indian oil consumption is expected to grow faster than that of any other major economy. This makes further improving energy security a key priority for India\u2019s economy, the report says.', 'The IEA welcomes Indian government policies designed to conduct large-scale renewable energy auctions, open up coal mining to private companies, and promote access to oil and gas markets for foreign investors. The report offers a wide range of recommendations for reforms in support of India\u2019s goal of promoting open and well-functioning energy markets in sectors such as coal, gas and electricity. These include building strong regulators to ensure non-discriminatory access, moving from state allocation to market pricing, and further rationalising energy subsidies.', 'In India\u2019s renewables-rich states, the share of variable renewables in electricity generation is already above 15%, a level that calls for dedicated policies to ensure they integrate smoothly into the power system. NITI Aayog can play a strong role in working with the states to implement power sector reforms, advance grid integration, improve flexibility and coordinate energy policy decisions.', 'The review also strongly encourages India to institutionalise energy policy coordination across government with a national energy policy framework.', 'NITI Aayog Vice Chairman Dr Kumar emphasised that India\u2019s energy goals cannot be achieved without strong coordination of policies and targets between central and state governments, notably on electricity market design and renewable targets, and that a stronger cooperation is therefore needed on these fronts.', 'Coal Minister Joshi said: \u201cWith the support of Amitabh Kant and Dr. Rajiv Kumar, India recently launched commercial mining operations. IEA\u2019s report will be very helpful for designing our future course of action in the energy sector.\u201d', 'Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Pradhan said: \u201cNITI Aayog is already preparing a National Energy Strategy, and I would like to propose an annual event where NITI Aayog and the IEA bring together global energy stakeholders to have structured energy dialogue. We look forward to engaging with the IEA on oil security and on helping India move towards a natural gas-based economy.\u201d', 'Power and Renewable Energy Minister Singh congratulated the IEA and NITI Aayog for the launch of the report: \u201cIndia\u2019s energy policy is a global story. India has the largest unified power grid that operates in single frequency. India has moved from scarcity to surplus electricity over the past few years while implementing the largest and the fastest energy access and energy efficiency programmes in the world.\u201d', 'The report will help India to design implementation strategies to achieve secure and sustainable energy access for its citizens.', '\\n', '\\n', 'Source: IEA']"

But stiff US sanctions that deprive Tehran of crucial revenue will crimp the regime\u2019s ability to finance destabilizing activities against its neighboring countries, ultimately boosting energy security, said Francis Fannon, assistant secretary in the US State Department\u2019s Bureau of Energy Resources.', '\u201cOur objective was to deprive them of this revenue. In so doing, we\u2019ve taken more than 2 million b/d off the market,\u201d Fannon said Sunday in an interview. \u201cWe\u2019ve deprived the regime of tens of billions of dollars that would have otherwise gone to fund proxy wars, terrorism and instability.\u201d', 'Platts spoke to Fannon on the sidelines of the Atlantic Council Global Energy Forum in Abu Dhabi, where he also discussed Iraq\u2019s reliance on Iranian gas and electricity, the state of Iran\u2019s oil exports, and US \u201cenergy abundance.\u201d', 'This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity.', 'S&P GLOBAL PLATTS: In your conversations with officials around the region, how much concern remains about threats from Iran to energy security and infrastructure?', 'FANNON: I don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessarily elevated. What has been increasingly recognized is the market having a greater degree of confidence in the US producer to respond to instability and volatility in the oil markets. The rest of the world is starting to catch up to the US success story. Now, I was here around the same time last year in Abu Dhabi, and I was here then, as I\u2019m here now, firstly to underscore the US commitment to political stability in the region and to work in partnership with our allies. Second is to speak about and encourage greater confidence in resilient, transparent energy markets. In short, we have security of those markets, not just the potential but the meaningful production from the US and the responsiveness of the US producer.', 'PLATTS: President Donald Trump has indicated, after some confusion about the continued presence of US troops in Iraq, that he will not be withdrawing them. How vital is the presence of US troops to that energy security and political stability that you talked about?', 'FANNON: The Iraq issue, I would invite people to look closely to what that vote was and what it represented and how one should interpret out of that. The US commitment to Iraq and political stability is enduring. Iraq\u2019s oil and gas industry is really an opportunity to support a free and sovereign Iraq. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve been calling for, for many years. Iraq has great potential. We want to help them realize that.', 'PLATTS: Iraq is reliant on gas and electricity supplies from Iran, and you\u2019ve been in dialogue with Iraq to try and get them to reduce that reliance on Iranian energy. How close is Iraq to getting off those supplies and what can the US do to help that?', 'FANNON: Our sanctions are prescriptive, and so you mentioned Iran continues to export energy to Iraq. In order for that to continue, the US has issued a waiver from those sanctions on a 90-day rolling basis. In order to achieve that waiver, Iraq must demonstrate credible steps that it is taking to reduce its dependency on Iran. I can\u2019t go into details on that, but that\u2019s the process that we will pursue, and I suspect we will have a robust dialogue and carefully review that decision.', 'PLATTS: President Trump has suggested he\u2019s also considering sanctions on Iraq if US troops are ordered to be withdrawn. Can you talk about what is being considered if this comes to pass?', 'FANNON: I can\u2019t really speak to that, I\u2019d have to direct you to the White House.', 'PLATTS: You mentioned that US sanctions have taken more than 2 million b/d of Iranian oil exports off the market. How much Iranian oil is still leaking onto the market?', 'FANNON: I can\u2019t speculate. The Iranian regime is a criminal enterprise, and criminals operate based on avoiding the law. So I can\u2019t speculate on what those numbers would be. I would point out, when I was here a year ago, the US had provided eight countries with [Iran sanctions waivers], and oil prices were about $62 to $63/b for Brent at that time. Today it\u2019s $64/b. basically no change. We went from eight [waivers] to zero. That\u2019s the story that should be told and underscored. And why is that? It goes back in large measure to the partnership we have with other producing countries, as well as recognition of the US producer to respond to market conditions.', 'PLATTS: Based on tanker tracking and what we hear from the market, China remains a significant buyer of Iranian oil. Has this been addressed with the Chinese, perhaps as part of trade deal negotiations?', 'FANNON: We have frequent communications with a variety of stakeholders both companies and countries, including China. That\u2019s as a matter of course. For particular discussions, I can\u2019t go into that. Those are confidential diplomatic communications.', 'PLATTS: Is there an oil price that the Trump administration would like to see? Are you comfortable with current oil prices?', 'FANNON: One of the virtues of our system is that the US government doesn\u2019t have any say in oil prices. We don\u2019t have any national oil companies, we don\u2019t coordinate volumes of production. What we do is we have thousands of different companies engaged in the oil patch and making independent investment decisions, and they do that because it makes good business sense for them. So what the oil price will be, it\u2019s not for us to say. What we do focus on, though, and spend a considerable amount of time on, is to ensure there is a transparent, liquid and free market, and under those conditions, the US producer can respond appropriately. The US energy abundance story is still being told or very much in the first stages, and it certainly has been a considerable contribution to the US economy.', '\\nSource: ', '\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t']"

This has created a build-up of supply that, if unlocked after a de-escalation between the U.S. and Iran, could drive crude prices down.', '\u201cThis is a major bearish overhang on the markets,\u201d Paul Sheldon, chief geopolitical adviser for S&P Global Platts, said during Yahoo Finance\u2019s On the Move.', 'To be sure, a near-term de-escalation of U.S.-Iran tensions remains unlikely as Tehran mulls retaliation over a U.S. airstrike that last week took out one of its top military commanders. Concerns that Iran\u2019s reprisal could hit the Middle East\u2019s oil infrastructure have put energy traders on edge, sending Brent crude prices (BZ=F) briefly above $70 per barrel Monday for the first time since September.', 'But an eventual deal between the U.S. and Iran may not be completely off the table in the future, with pundits speculating both sides will ultimately attempt to avoid a full-fledged military confrontation.', 'And as Sheldon points out, a deal between the U.S. and Iran would likely usher in the return to market of more than a million barrels per day worth of Iranian crude exports taken offline via sanctions.', 'U.S. sanctions on Iran have more than halved Iran\u2019s oil production since 2018, Sheldon estimates, with exports having decreased from around 2 million barrels per day to between 400,000 to 500,000.', 'In the short-term, that means any impact on Iran\u2019s oil supplies as U.S.-Iran tensions continue to simmer won\u2019t generate as prominent an effect on energy markets as it would have in absence of the sanctions, Sheldon said.', 'But in the longer-term, this creates an opportunity for payback. Namely, in the event that a U.S.-Iran deal were to occur, the sanctions-related curb on Iran\u2019s crude production could reverse, adding even more supply to an oil market already facing a mounting glut.', '\u201cWe think it\u2019d probably take about a year for them to get almost all the 2 million barrels a day back of production,\u201d Sheldon said. \u201cSo if that happens, we\u2019ve been looking at 2021, 2022, possibly, after the U.S. election, either because a Democrat wins or because Iran realizes they need to come to the table in the event of a Trump re-election. But inevitably, yeah, this is something that is out there for sure. And this is a dramatically bearish overhang.\u201d', '\\nSource: Yahoo Finance']"

    "title": "How Russian Oil Has The Most To Gain From Iran-U.S. Crisis",
    "content": "['Probably one of the most far-reaching effects of an escalation of the U.S.-Iran conflict could be a shutdown of oil tanker traffic via the Strait of Hormuz by Iran. Though unlikely\u2014given the severity of the consequences\u2014such a move would push international oil markets into considerable turmoil, since approximately 21 percent of globally consumed petroleum passes through the strait. Russia could become a crucial market stabilizer deriving significant financial, strategic, and diplomatic benefits.', 'Even with a release of IEA strategic stocks, higher crude prices resulting from a shutdown of the Strait of Hormuz would likely affect everyone in a similar fashion. If protracted, the crisis and high oil prices would have a dumping effect on global energy consumption and could result in a global economic slowdown. However, at least in the short term, oil producers could benefit from high prices. Russia, in particular.', 'One of the reasons why OPEC has had such a great influence on the world\u2019s crude market is its ability to increase (or decrease) production at any given time to dampen potential swings in oil prices. This ability hinges mostly on OPEC\u2019s most powerful member (and not only in terms of crude supply or spare capacity)\u2014Saudi Arabia, which disposes of OPEC\u2019s bulk (and the world\u2019s largest) crude spare capacity, approximately 1.5-2 million barrels per day. With a blockade or severe limitation in traffic in the Strait of Hormuz, Saudi Arabia\u2019s ability to release its spare capacity to the market would be greatly impeded, if not disabled altogether.', 'In the meantime, Iran (!) and Venezuela, the runners up when it comes to global spare capacity, are unable to step in due to external (sanctions) and domestic issues. Also, U.S. shale producers who would at least in the beginning benefit from high crude prices could not be helpful in the same way Saudi Arabia could. Shale production can respond quickly to changing market conditions\u2014much quicker than conventional crude production\u2014but not as quick as a guarantee of almost an immediate release of additional volumes.', 'And since U.S. crude production is in the hands of private companies, it is dictated by the market. Hence, it cannot be stopped at a certain price level but will flow until the market saturates. There is also the aspect of U.S. crude quality that differs substantially from Saudi crude. U.S. shale is lower in density (lighter) and sweeter (includes less sulfur) and, as such, cannot immediately act as a substitute.', 'One country that could potentially have it all is Russia.', 'Not only does Russia produce the \u201cright\u201d quality of crude (a substitute for the crude potentially locked in by the Strait of Hormuz), but according to a Russian government statement, it holds spare capacity of 500,000 barrels per day. The country cut its oil production due to an agreement with OPEC to prevent oil prices from falling too low in a high-supply environment. With oil prices rising and OPEC generally unable to provide relief, Russia and its oil companies (generally not happy with the production cuts) would surely jump at the opportunity to make the extra buck.', 'Already after the attack on the Saudi Arabian oil facilities late last year, Russia signaled it would be able to provide additional supplies thanks to new investment its companies have made into new spare capacity. Saudi Arabia was able to regain its import volumes quickly and Russia could not prove this new advantage. If an external factor like the closure of the Strait of Hormuz were to block Saudi oil, Russia would have a real chance to put this new spare capacity to test.', 'Russia\u2019s leverage in the global oil market has increased in the recent years. The country has become an important partner to OPEC in its struggle to remain the deciding entity to influence oil prices after the U.S. shale revolution unfolded. If OPEC\u2019s crude exports were significantly impaired by Iran-US conflict, Russia would stand to profit handsomely in terms of both actual revenues and in terms of geopolitical influence. Higher prices and production would not only benefit Russian companies but also the Russian budget, given the heavy taxation of the oil industry, especially exports. This aspect is particularly attractive to Russia, as globally crude is traded in U.S. dollars, currency that the country is thirsty for after the U.S.-imposed sanctions on Russian financial institutions following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and interference in U.S. elections.', 'Russia also stands to gain geopolitical influence.', 'Lower diversification of crude supply that a blockade of the Strait of Hormuz would imply, would buttress the perception of Russia as a stable producer and exporter. But while Saudi Arabia has shied away from using its supply beyond regulating market and oil price swings\u2014at least after the 1970s oil crisis\u2014Russia has been less reserved in this matter. After all research shows Russia has repeatedly used its strong bargaining position as oil and gas supplier to extract geopolitical benefits in Central and Eastern Europe.', 'A blockade of the Strait of Hormuz could potentially strengthen Russia\u2019s position vis-a-vis energy-hungry Asia since about three-fourths of the crude that passes through the Strait lands there. And this is on top of the increasing importance of Russian natural gas that flows to the Chinese market via the newly opened Power of Siberia pipeline. The plot thickens even more when one considers military exercises Russia, China, and Iran have just concluded in the Gulf of Oman.', 'The law of unintended consequences is hard at work when one considers any type of escalation in the conflict between the U.S. and Iran. And while the Strait of Hormuz has not been blocked yet and may not be blocked any time soon, the option cannot be completely ruled out. Thus, it is important to think through the potential effects that a blockade could have not only on pricing or availability of crude but also on the geopolitical power transfer to a player like Russia\u2014which is already seen as strategic and diplomatic beneficiary of the U.S.-Iran conflict as well as the forced departure of U.S. forces from Iraq.', '\\nSource: Baker Institute']"

Once it becomes clear that those disruptions are not materialising, traders calm down and so do oil prices. Life on the global markets returns to business as usual.', 'It\u2019s a cycle that\u2019s been repeated several times over the last 12 months, to varying degrees. The most recent incident happened on Wednesday, when Iran fired rockets at two Iraqi military bases that host troops from the United States. The attack was retaliation for the US\u2019s assassination of Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran\u2019s Quds Force elite military wing, in a drone attack near Baghdad on Friday.', 'But even without the spikes, the price of oil has steadily increased over the last six months, as Iran and the US attacked each others\u2019 interests and allies in the region.', 'And that has analysts in Asia worried. The region is home to some of the world\u2019s biggest importers of foreign energy, including India, China, South Korea and Japan.', '\u201cThe Middle East is a key source of Asia\u2019s oil supply, making [Asia] particularly vulnerable in the event of a severe supply disruption, but a more likely threat is that of higher prices affecting the current account, slowing [economic] growth and fuelling inflation,\u201d says Peter Kiernan, lead energy analyst at The Economist Intelligence Unit in Hong Kong.', '\u201cIf, however, the current standoff between the US and Iran subsides, fears of economic collateral damage will be eased, but longer term [Asia] will need to look at its growing rate of oil-import dependence through the lens of threats to energy security as well as economic performance,\u201d Kiernan told Al Jazeera.', 'Brent crude oil futures prices surged by up to four percent in early Wednesday trading in Asia, touching a five-month high of $71.75 a barrel, before drifting lower once it became apparent that no production, processing or transportation facilities had been affected.', 'In September, drone attacks on two Saudi Aramco oil installations resulted in the biggest-ever one-day jump in oil prices. But Aramco quickly repaired its facilities in Abqaiq and Khurais and resumed production, bringing prices back down.', 'In neither incident did the Strait of Hormuz between Iran and the United Arab Emirates become choked off for oil shipments leaving the region.', 'Even attacks on oil tankers last year in the Gulf failed to close off the crucially important shipping channel.', 'Heading higher?', '\\nBut from the lows of early August, crude prices have risen by nearly 23 percent, according to data by Refinitiv. And they\u2019re up almost 37 percent since the end of 2018. A combination of Middle East tensions and supply cuts by major oil producers helped keep prices buoyant.', 'According to the International Trade Centre \u2013 a joint agency of the World Trade Organization and the United Nations \u2013 China was the world\u2019s biggest oil importer in 2018, accounting for 20.2 percent of global crude supplies. The US was second, with 13.8 percent, followed by India, with 9.7 percent of the world\u2019s imports. Japan and South Korea rounded out the top five.', 'But India is far more dependent on oil imports for domestic consumption than China is. Crude imports accounted for 83.8 percent of India\u2019s needs in its 2018-2019 financial year, figures from the country\u2019s oil ministry show. For China, that figure was 69.8 percent, according to a report in the state-controlled China Daily newspaper last year.', '\u201cNet crude oil-importing economies such as Singapore, Thailand, South Korea and India are the most vulnerable to higher oil prices in Asia, given their relatively higher reliance on crude oil imports,\u201d Lloyd Chan, an economist at Oxford Economics in Hong Kong, told Al Jazeera.', '\u201cIn particular, India is likely to be the most affected, as higher oil prices will raise inflation and worsen the outlook of its current account balance,\u201d he added.', 'A growing energy-import bill is not something that Indian policymakers are likely to be relishing right now.', 'India\u2019s Ministry of Statistics said on Tuesday that it expects its economy to grow by five percent in the year to March 2020. That would put it on course for its slowest growth rate since 2013.', 'And rising fuel costs could exacerbate growing anger on the streets.', 'On Wednesday, hundreds of thousands of workers and students across the country protested against what they described as Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s \u201canti-people\u201d policies. They are angry at the government\u2019s plans to privatise some public firms.', 'Diversification', '\\nElsewhere in Asia, some countries have done a better job of diversifying their energy mix than India has as they try to buffer themselves against external oil-price shocks.', 'China, for instance, has invested heavily in renewable energy, even though it remains the world\u2019s top emitter of greenhouse gases. But according to energy consultancy firm Wood Mackenzie, China\u2019s cost of producing electricity from wind and solar poweris already cheaper than gas-fired power, and will be \u201ccompetitive with coal-fired power by 2026\u201d.', 'Japan, though still heavily reliant on imported liquefied natural gas (LNG), is also boosting the proportion of renewable energy in its supply mix. The Institute of Energy Economics, Japan, estimates that around 11 percent of its power generation will come from renewable sources, not including hydroelectricity, this year. That\u2019s up one percentage point from 2019. Meanwhile, the share of fossil fuels will drop from 47 percent in 2019 to 44 percent this year.', '\u201cBecause energy needs [in Japan, South Korea and China] are largely fulfilled by LNG \u2026 and some renewables these days, I believe that the net impact to energy costs should be mitigated somewhat,\u201d Lorraine Tan, Morningstar\u2019s Asia regional director of equity research, told Al Jazeera.', 'But a major conflagration in the Middle East that chokes off shipments of oil and gas through the Strait of Hormuz could send energy prices much, much higher than even the recent spikes have reached.', 'If that happens, Asia\u2019s economies could end up in truly uncharted waters.', '\\nSource: Al Jazeera']"

As of January 3, the Akademik Cherskiy remained in Russia\u2019s Far East near Vladivostok, according to cFlow.', 'Meanwhile, the US-enforced delay to Nord Stream 2 has not gone down well in Europe, either.

    "title": "Suriname Oil Discovery Brings Welcome Good News To Apache Corp.",
    "content": "['The last several years have been a difficult time for Apache Corporation. The company has seen its stock price plummet \u2013 like many of its peer companies \u2013 as the U.S. industry\u2019s success in creating a new abundance of both oil and natural gas has led to chronic low commodity prices. That in turn has resulted in a vicious cycle of diminishing returns to investors and, consequently, diminishing access to new capital as banks and other third-party funders turn their focus to higher-return endeavors.', 'Apache\u2019s specific situation has been exacerbated by the reality that its discovery of a major new resource in the Delaware Basin of Texas, the Alpine High, has been unfairly characterized in much of the energy media as just a natural gas play, even though, as I detailed in a January, 2019 piece, it is quite rich in multiple grades of liquids. That focus on the Alpine High has also led to the media and investment community giving short shrift to the company\u2019s overall portfolio in the Delaware/Permian Basin, and its diverse and balanced global portfolio that CEO John Christmann recently said \u201caffords the flexibility to allocate capital across all three hydrocarbon streams and among conventional and unconventional assets as warranted by market conditions.\u201d', 'Apache\u2019s common stock traded above $65 as recently as November, 2016, but had fallen all the way to below $21 in early December of last year. While other companies in Apache\u2019s peer group have also seen their stock prices decline in recent years, Apache\u2019s dropoff was more severe than most, causing rumors to swirl about the company possibly becoming a takeover target in 2020.', 'It was amid all of this confluence of factors that news broke on January 7 that the company, in a 50/50 partnership with French multi-national Total, had made a major new oil discovery offshore Suriname, a tiny nation on the north central coast of South America. Apache Corp.\u2019s stock price jumped by 27% in the wake of the announcement on Tuesday, and rose again by $.22 per share on Wednesday amid a general selloff in oil stocks that resulted from the deescalation of the conflict between the U.S. and Iran.', 'The discovery well Maka Central-1 was drilled on Block 58 using the drillship Noble Sam Croft. According to Christmann, \u201cBlock 58 comprises 1.4 million acres and offers significant potential beyond the discovery at Maka Central. We have identified at least seven distinct play types and more than 50 prospects within the thermally mature play fairway.\u201d Christmann went on to add that the partners\u2019 preliminary formation evaluation data \u201cindicates the potential for prolific oil wells. Additionally, the size of the stratigraphic feature, as defined by 3-D seismic imaging, suggests a substantial resource.\u201d', 'So, the company thinks this discovery could work into a very large resource, and investment analysts have initially agreed. RBC Capital Markets said that \u201cThis appears to be a significant discovery and should be viewed very positively,\u201d while Bank of America was quoted by Bloomberg as characterizing the discovery as a potential \u201cgame changer for the investment case.\u201d This is the sort of positive market reaction that makes any corporate executive smile.', 'Interestingly, Suriname borders the similarly small nation of Guyana, where ExxonMobil, in partnership with Hess and CNOOC, has made several major new oil discoveries in the past two years on its Stabroek offshore block. As I\u2019ve detailed in a series of pieces over the past year, the billions in proceeds from the Stabroek development will likely have a transformative impact for the economy of that nation of barely 800,000 people.', 'It is obviously far too early to know whether this new discovery by Apache and Total might eventually provide a similar positive financial impact for Suriname, a country with just 584,000 citizens and very little current petroleum production. But certainly, the initial indicators are encouraging.', 'What we do know, however, is that this week\u2019s announcement has already had an initial transformative impact on the trajectory of Apache Corp.\u2019s stock price, and not a moment too soon. When Christmann and his leadership team made the decision several years ago to shift the company\u2019s strategy from an \u2018acquire and exploit\u2019 effort to a focus on exploration, both domestically and internationally, the market analyst community was by and large skeptical.', 'With this week\u2019s developments, that level of skepticism has dropped dramatically.', '\\nSource: Forbes']"

Iran has threatened to block the Strait of Hormuz, which sees over half of global linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) exports pass by its banks.', 'The strait is vital for passage of a huge proportion of global chemicals trade as a gateway between the west and the east, and any long-term closure of the route in the event of all-out conflict in the Middle East could be disastrous for players and end markets across the world.', 'The question remains whether Iran would be able to close off the strait in the long-term if it decided to attempt that.', '\u201cIran could close the Strait\u2026 but the US can force it open,\u201d said a source with knowledge of the geopolitical conditions in the region. \u201cThe biggest threat to the Gulf in terms of the strait is if Iran mines it\u2026 [or] they probably deploy their four submarines, but they wouldn\u2019t last very long in the face of an American naval operation.

In the short-term you\u2019d get some disruption but not in the longer-term.\u201d', 'IRAQ INSTABILITY', '\\nThere are also implications on a longer timeframe if substantial quantities of oil are removed from the market, which would have a significant effect on petrochemicals production costs and margins.', 'Iraq, nominally an ally to both sides of the conflict and a key OPEC power, is finding its political footing, already unstable, to be increasingly precarious as the conflict escalates. Soleiman was killed on Iraqi soil, and the Iranian retaliatory strikes were focussed on US military bases in the country.', 'The country is also facing the threat of sanctions from the US after the Iraqi parliament voted unanimously to expel US troops stationed there.', 'The deposal of former ruler Saddam Hussein has led to a steady increase in Iranian influence in the country, according to the UK\u2019s House of Commons, as the shift from a Sunni to Shiite-led administration resulted in greater philosophical alignment with Iran, which it has sought to cultivate.', '\u201cThe overthrow of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is widely seen as a strategic gift to Iran,\u201d said Ben Smith of UK state research organisation the House of Commons Library. \u201cFrom a hostile, Sunni-led state, Iraq was converted into a Shiite-led country with natural affinities with Iran.\u201d', '\u201cSince 2003, Iran\u2019s influence in Iraq has steadily grown, particularly as western countries, especially the US, had reduced their presence,\u201d he added.', 'Aside from fears of becoming the battleground for a proxy war between the US and Iran, Iraq\u2019s political landscape is extremely unstable after the formal resignation of Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi in December last year, and described by an analyst cited by UK state researchers as a \u201cslowly failing\u201d state.', 'Iraq was the second-largest OPEC crude producer by output in November, pumping out an average of 4.64m bbl/day during the month, and if external political tensions exacerbate instability in the country, the market could see a substantial player hamstrung at a time when oil prices are already rising.', 'Soleimani was understood to be involved in attempting to broker the formation of a new government, so his death could also have implications for those negotiations.', 'BYSTANDER EFFECT', '\\nEconomists at think tank TS Lombard also point to the potential of \u201cbystander effect\u201d, where allies of either party could be caught in the crossfire, just as the countries worst-hit by the US-China trade war were Germany and emerging market economies.', 'With Iran likely to make life more difficult for US forces in Iraq and eastern Syria, its ties to Russia may mean that the eastern European giant may face additional sanctions as a result of that closeness, according to Christopher Granville, chief political economist at the firm.', '\u201cOne of the more obvious political side-effects [of increased military or political aggression in Syria] would be to lower the bar to a renewed escalation in sanctions against Russia,\u201d he said. \u201cThis conclusion about heightened sanctions risk does not depend on any assumptions about specific Russian action or inaction in response to the \u2018Soleimani crisis\u2019\u201d.', '\u201cFor both the Congress and the Trump administration it could well be enough that Iran is causing further US military casualties, and that Russia is aligned with Iran in the theatres concerned,\u201d he added.', 'With the situation as febrile as it is, the situation could develop incredibly quickly in any direction. But with Iran keen to avoid a full-blown military conflict with a vastly more powerful rival, fallout could appear in the form of attacks on the strait, interference with allied powers, and intensified economic sanctions from the US.', 'Market players will need to stay abreast of developments and roll with the punches.', '\\nSource: ICIS by Tom Brown (', ')']"

    "content": "['The world\u2019s oil and gas explorers powered ahead and discovered 12.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent (boe) in 2019, the highest volume since 2015, according to estimates from Rystad Energy. Last year recorded 26 discoveries of more than 100 million boe, with offshore regions dominating the list of new oil and gas deposits.', 'Guyana\u2019s success story from 2018 continued in 2019, with ExxonMobil adding four new discoveries within its offshore Stabroek block, while Tullow Oil\u2019s Jethro and Joe exploration wells established the presence of a working petroleum system to the west of the Stabroek block. Rystad Energy estimates that the discoveries in Guyana hold cumulative recoverable resources of around 1.8 billion boe.', '\u201cExxonMobil can be declared explorer of the year for a second year in a row thanks to its ongoing efforts and results in Guyana, along with significant investments in Cyprus. The supermajor was exceptional, both in terms of discovered volumes and value creation from exploration,\u201d says Palzor Shenga, a senior analyst on Rystad Energy\u2019s upstream team.', 'The US company discovered around 1.07 billion boe in additional net resources last year. Rystad Energy estimates the value creation from these volumes to be around $2.7 billion, largely driven by the continued success in Guyana.', 'Off the coast of Mauritania, BP\u2019s Orca gas field was not only the largest single discovery, but also the deepest-water find of 2019, estimated by Rystad Energy to hold about 1.3 billion boe of recoverable resources. Recent gas discoveries in the region now support plans to build an additional LNG hub in the Bir Allah area in Mauritania.', 'In Russia, Gazprom announced two discoveries in the Kara Sea, Dinkov in the Rusanovsky block and Nyarmeyskoye in the Nyarmeysky block. Rystad Energy estimates Gazprom\u2019s 2019 discoveries to hold combined recoverable resources of around 1.5 billion boe, with Dinkov ranked as the second-largest find in 2019 world-wide.', 'Other key offshore discoveries in 2019 include Total\u2019s Brulpadda in South Africa, ExxonMobil\u2019s Glaucus in Cyprus, CNOOC\u2019s Glengorm in the United Kingdom and Equinor\u2019s Sputnik in the Norwegian sector of the Barents Sea.', 'Even so, many of 2019\u2019s high-impact wells turned out to be duds, Shenga noted. \u201cAlthough the discovered volumes for 2019 surpassed the preceding year, it was a disappointing year for high-profile wells as many prospects with significant estimated pre-drill resources failed to deliver. Over 10 billion barrels of estimated pre-drill volumes were at stake in wells that failed to encounter hydrocarbons.\u201d', 'US independent Hess and Chinese state player CNOOC occupy the second and the third spots on the list of top explorers of 2019 in terms of value creation from new discoveries, with both benefiting from their partnership with ExxonMobil in Guyana\u2019s Stabroek block. Hess added about $2 billion in value from new discoveries last year, while CNOOC had value creation of about $1.8 billion.', 'French major Total took fourth place, with about $873 million in value creation from its 2019 exploration activities. \u201cTotal\u2019s value creation from exploration in 2019 was largely driven by the play-opening success with the Brulpadda find in South Africa,\u201d says Shenga.', 'In 2020, Rystad Energy expects the global discovered volumes to continue the rising trend of recent years, with the list of upcoming wildcats including several high-impact wells along with some promising probes delayed from 2019.', '\\nSource: Rystad Energy']"

Comstock\u2019s strategy is to acquire Chesapeake\u2019s Haynesville assets during the downturn cycle and maximize cost efficiencies stemming from close proximities of newly acquired wells to the company\u2019s existing acreage.', '\u201cOver the past few years, Comstock has focused on lowering operating costs. The company will continue to do so by leveraging over 500 miles of owned gathering infrastructure and by renegotiating new gathering contracts and long-term marketing arrangements to gain access to the Gulf Coast premium markets. If Comstock manages to integrate Chesapeake\u2019s assets with reduced operating cost, the combined NPV of such a position can reach approximately US$5.8bn versus US$4.1bn of Comstock\u2019s current position.', '\u201cThere is a strong positive expectation for natural gas demand growth via new power, petrochemical and liquefied natural gas (LNG) plants but this does not necessarily guarantee a high natural gas price. There is a common consensus in the industry that the US LNG supply glut has started to form and will continue until the early 2020s, putting additional downward pressure on current LNG prices and ultimately impacting natural gas prices as well. This uncertainty will continue to force US natural gas operators into even higher cost efficiencies through larger scale operations which can in turn drive more merger and acquisition (M&A) activity in the coming years.\u201d', '\\nSource: GlobalData']"

Beyond the Middle East, Russia and Africa, it also has been looking intently at the US, where S&P Global Platts Analytics expects LNG export capacity to more than double to roughly 13.7 Bcf/d by 2025 versus 2019.', 'Seizing that opportunity, Sempra Energy\u2019s proposed Port Arthur LNG export project in Texas reached a preliminary deal in May 2019 for Aramco to take a 25% stake, including a long-term commitment for 5 million mt/year of offtake from the facility. On Monday, the two companies said they had signed what they described as an interim project participation agreement memorializing key milestones and mechanisms, though a definitive deal is still subject to further approvals and conditions. The length of time it is taking to get to a firm transaction may be a signal of a challenge convincing Aramco \u2014 whose shares have slumped in recent days amid tensions between the US and Iran \u2014 to reach into its deep pockets.', '\u201cSaudis still seem very non-committal on US LNG at this point, which means they\u2019re not ready yet to plunk down any cash,\u201d said Madeline Jowdy, Platts Analytics senior director, global gas and LNG.', 'Tellurian has had talks with Aramco about a potential equity partnership in its proposed Driftwood LNG project in Louisiana.

Last month, CEO Meg Gentle said in an interview that Tellurian was negotiating with a large buyer to take a $2 billion partnership stake in Driftwood and give it the remaining equity it needs.

Officials for the developers either declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment Monday about whether they were in active talks with Aramco.', 'The heads of agreement previously announced between Sempra and Aramco sketched out the prospect for Aramco to make a 25% equity investment into Port Arthur LNG\u2019s first phase, with the offtake component being discussed lasting for 20 years. The volume, if finalized, would represent almost half the capacity of phase one.', 'Besides the 11 million mt/year Port Arthur project, Sempra is the majority owner in a joint venture that controls Cameron LNG in Louisiana, where two trains are currently operating and a third one is under construction. Sempra has proposed expanding Cameron LNG and adding liquefaction capabilities at the site of a regasification facility in Baja California, Mexico.', 'As for Aramco, whatever project or projects in the US it settles on, it is making clear it has more than a passing interest in expanding its energy portfolio to include more LNG. It expects global demand for LNG to continue in the coming years, and with that it sees significant opportunities in the market, CEO Amin Nasser said in a statement Monday about the advancement of talks with Sempra at Port Arthur LNG.', '\\nSource: ', '\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t']"

Even as restraints pop there, though, discipline appears to be holding up in one crucial corner farther away: the shale patch.', 'The prospect of a conflict-inspired jump in oil prices is, in purely economic terms, like a glass of water in the desert for U.S. energy stocks. The sector closed 2019 as the worst performer of the year and the decade; it has begun 2020 in the green, at least. The short story is that investors have wised up to the benefits of higher oil prices flowing disproportionately to insiders and (by way of drilling budgets) contractors. Hence, exploration and production companies have tried to reset the relationship with investors on a platform of disciplined spending, lower leverage and higher returns. Higher oil prices provide temptation to backslide on this.', 'Thus far, however \u2014 and it is very early days in this current crisis \u2014 the message from financial markets is: Backslide at your peril.', 'Not so long ago, an event like Thursday evening\u2019s assassination of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani would have set off a frenzy in oil prices and the stocks of companies producing the stuff. Yet crude oil is up only a bit more than 4%, while E&P stocks have risen less than 2%. Shares of oilfield services stocks, which would tend to benefit first from any backsliding on drilling budgets, are up even less.', 'Investors may be cautious about taking a definitive view on how things will play out between the U.S. and Iran. Geopolitical events have a habit of spurring oil-price spikes that fade quickly, not least after the attacks on Saudi Arabia\u2019s critical Abqaiq facility in September. When it comes to E&P stocks, that caution is compounded by the industry\u2019s past performance. Indeed, it is illustrative to look at what has happened to valuation multiples now versus September.', 'Energy stocks, alongside oil, had already enjoyed gains in the month leading up to Soleimani\u2019s death. This December rally was broad-based, resting largely on hopes of a thaw in another war (the trade one). Hence, despite valuation multiples rising by roughly 0.5-1 turn of Ebitda, on average, for E&P and services stocks, their discounts to the wider market barely changed.', 'Investors would prefer any geopolitical windfall to go into their own pockets or repairing balance sheets. I wrote in late November about the gap that had opened up between heavily indebted E&P companies and less-levered peers in terms of stock-price performance. While all benefited from the December rally, the lower-leveraged names are performing better so far this year (see the original column for details on these custom indices.', 'Similarly, the average spread on energy high-yield bonds had already dropped by roughly 150 basis points from its early December peak. While it tightened a little further on Friday, it remained above 660 points, notably wider than where it went in the immediate aftermath of the Abqaiq attack. It is both telling, and logical, that Occidental Petroleum Corp., which blew a hole in its balance sheet and reputation with last year\u2019s acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum Corp., announced on Monday morning it had taken the opportunity to hedge more of its production (and will deconsolidate the debt of its pipeline subsidiary, to boot).', 'Even if our worst (or semi-worst) fears concerning the Middle East are realized over the next several weeks, by the time quarterly calls begin, E&P firms would do best to mostly ignore the oil market\u2019s gyrations. Investors, like most of us, would prefer to focus on stability and the stuff we can control.', '\\nSource: Bloomberg']"

The U.S. is now predicted to become a net energy exporter this year.', 'However, the process of fracking is controversial. The potential harm to the environment and local communities is polarizing. Opponents argue that water contamination and air pollution warrant stricter regulation and in some cases, a complete ban. Proponents say there is little or no evidence linking pollution to gas drilling. A common argument is that burning natural gas is more environmentally friendly than burning coal.', 'Some reports indicate individuals may have been harmed during the process, often due to the mishandling of wastewater or improper building of boreholes. Bryan Latkanich, who leased his southwestern Pennsylvania property to Chevron, claims drilling there has caused him and his son health problems and has damaged his property. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Health and Chevron have not found a link between the drilling and his claims. \u201cUltimately at this point, I just want to get a buyout and move my son away from here and myself so we can try to get better and have a normal life,\u201d says Latkanich.', 'Whether fracking should be allowed or not has been widely discussed. France, Germany, and Ireland have banned the practice. So have some states, including New York, Maryland, and Vermont. Democratic presidential hopefuls Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have said they intend to change regulations at the federal level.

    "title": "Operational Production Costs Have Fallen Globally, Led By The United Kingdom",
    "content": "['Operational production costs in the oil and gas industry have fallen across the globe, with the United Kingdom emerging as a cost-cutting powerhouse among global offshore regions. A Rystad Energy analysis aimed at mitigating currency effects confirms this trend, after examining regional opex reduction per barrel, measured in local currency. The results are clear \u2013 from 2014 to 2018 the UK reduced operational production costs by 31%, followed by Norway and the United States with opex reductions of 19% and 15%, respectively.', '\u201cThe reduction in operating expenditure is largely the result of offshore regions \u2013 such as the United Kingdom, Brazil, Nigeria, Angola, the Gulf of Mexico and Norway \u2013 feeling the squeeze of uncertain oil prices, which in turn has driven operators and contractors to nurture operational improvements in pursuit of lower unit prices,\u201d says Sara Sottilotta, Oilfield Service Analyst at Rystad Energy.', 'Secondly, with a greater focus on strategic planning, more efficient maintenance management and the increased and improved implementation of technology, opex per barrel of oil equivalent (boe) has fallen. It should be noted, however, that in times of downturn some opex reduction has historically been a consequence of maintenance deferral. This is important to bear in mind, as unplanned outages caused by equipment failure and damages have quadrupled globally since 2013.', '\u201cThe UK has experienced the greatest reduction in opex per boe, falling from more than $30 per barrel in 2014 to just $16 per barrel in 2019. The drop is attributable to two main factors: the general increase in production, and the falling share of production from mature fields as new fields came on-stream and old fields were shut-in,\u201d Sottilotta says.', 'Changing rotation cycles, the closing of older fields and lower salaries have also contributed to the reduced cost levels. A majority of UK offshore operators switched from two-week to three-week personnel rotations in 2015-2016, generating salary and logistics savings by reducing the number of flights required to shuttle personnel to and from offshore facilities. Still, despite this significant decrease in operational costs, the UK exhibits the highest opex per boe of all major offshore regions due to smaller field size, a fragmented operator landscape, a more mature continental shelf, and a higher number of personnel on board (POB) per produced barrel.', 'In absolute terms, Brazil experienced the second greatest drop in opex per boe, falling from $16 per boe in 2014 to $11 per boe in 2019. This reduction was driven primarily by a significant increase in production, especially from the giant Lula field. Across the globe, opex per boe in Norway is among the lowest, helped by the rising exchange rate between Norwegian Kroner (NOK) and the United States dollar (USD), which grew from an average of NOK 6.3 per $1 in 2014, to an average of NOK 8.3 per $1 in 2017. In contrast, Mexico\u2019s operating cost per boe has risen since 2016, the result of decreasing production and an increasing share of production from mature fields.', 'As Figure 2 above illustrates, the UK has achieved the greatest decrease in operational expenditure per production unit, even when considering expenditure in local currency. Norway and the US follow close behind, with each of the three leaders primarily doing business in their respective domestic currencies. It should be noted that Angola and Nigeria typically carry out operational transactions in USD. Because of this, when considering operational expenditure in local currency these countries appear to have experienced skyrocketing opex thanks to soaring local inflation, while real change in opex is likely not as great in magnitude.', '\\nSource: Rystad Energy']"

    "content": "['In the small hours of Friday (January 2) morning, the global oil market got its first geopolitical jolt of 2020 after a U.S. airstrike in Iraq took out Qasem Soleimani, an Iranian General of the country\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and commander of its Quds Force, a division primarily responsible for extraterritorial military and clandestine operations.', 'Soleimani\u2019s killing marked the most high profile political assassination in the region since that of another Iranian prot\u00e9g\u00e9 \u2013 Lebanese Islamic Jihad Organization\u2019s founder and then Hezbollah\u2019s second-in-command Imad Mughniyeh in 2008; a man widely thought to have masterminded the 1983 U.S. embassy bombing in Beirut, and described by none other than Soleimani as \u201cthe legend of our time.\u201d', 'However, there are two stark differences between both killings. First off, unlike Mughniyeh, Soleimani was an Iranian national and senior serving military official, and de facto architect-in-chief of proxy operations in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen.', 'Secondly, Mughniyeh\u2019s killing despite being blamed on the Central Intelligence Agency and Mossad, was never claimed by either whereas that of Soleimani was announced by U.S. President Donald Trump on Twitter. It came barely days after Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei had taunted Washington that it could do nothing regionally to his country following a spate of pro-Iran militia attacks on U.S. facilities and the American embassy in Baghdad in December.', 'Add it all up, and it has presented oil market speculators, ever keen on geopolitical risk premiums, with a very unique set of circumstances to take a punt on. Unlike other high profile take-downs of recent years, including that of Al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden (2011) and ISIS leader Abu Bakar Al-Baghdadi (2019), the geopolitical ramifications for the market are visible and direct. Both were wanted terrorists but Solemani was an Iranian state actor.', 'Iran and the U.S. have renewed hostilities since Trump withdrew Washington from the 2015 Iranian nuclear settlement brokered by European governments and the Obama administration in 2018. Since then, the President\u2019s sanctions have squeezed Iran\u2019s oil exports from an average of ~3.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in the wake of the settlement down to 2.15 million bpd, going by S&P Global Platt\u2019s OPEC survey for November 2019.', 'In the intervening period, oil tankers in the Persian Gulf have been attacked and Saudi Aramco\u2019s Abqaiq processing facility hit by drone and missile strikes. Blame of these has been apportioned on Iran, something it denies. Iran\u2019s forces in the Gulf have also detained (and released) oil tankers and cause other maritime harassment.', 'Before the latest escalation, long bets on Brent and West Texas Intermediate front-month futures contracts, i.e. calls on prices going up, were already on the up following OPEC\u2019s decision to deepen its crude production cuts by 500,000 bpd to 1.7 million bpd at its December meeting.', 'Taking out the actions of more pragmatic physical traders, pre-Christmas commitment of traders\u2019 data from both U.S. CFTC and ICE pointed to non-commercial traders expanding their collective net-long positions in oil futures to a 12 to 15-month high during the week ended Christmas Eve.', 'Soleimani\u2019s assassination has added the metaphorical fuel to the fire in the eyes of some. In European trading on Monday (January 6), Brent futures briefly hit $70.74 per barrel, before falling back to $69.56, up $0.96 or 1.40% intraday at 11:49 GMT, despite there being no actual oil supply disruption as yet. Tired old theories of the Iranians shutting down the Strait of Hormuz or all out war are doing the rounds once again.', 'Both are as unlikely in the wake of the latest flare-up, just as they were following attacks on Abqaiq in September for precisely the same reason \u2013 a need for their own self-preservation by Iranian hardliners.', 'A direct strike on U.S. assets would leave Iran\u2019s own coastline and all its ports vulnerable to a vastly superior American airstrike arsenal. And closing the Strait of Hormuz would be self-defeating to begin with, since it won\u2019t last both politically, as China which takes over 40% of its crude imports via the maritime artery won\u2019t stand for it, and militarily, as the U.S. would respond.', 'Instead, Iran would respond via its preferred modus operandi \u2013 proxy wars the likes of Soleimani facilitated, and the likes of Mughniyeh benefited from. Such disruptive tactics equated to a near $10 per barrel premium in the eyes of many paper traders prior to the U.S. shale revolution, and before Obama and European leaders initially brought Iran back to the negotiating table.', 'Anyone who thinks a return to those days is imminent short of an unlikely all out Gulf War III is kidding themselves, especially given that the U.S., one of the world\u2019s leading crude consumers, is itself on the verge of becoming a net energy exporter and on track to pump in excess of 13 million bpd in 2020.', 'An upper $60s to lower $70s per barrel Brent price range is also likely to bring more non-OPEC crude on to the market, something that was already on the horizon. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), non-OPEC countries will alone add another 2.3 million bpd to their supply in 2020, while global oil demand growth is expected to be typically around 1.2 million bpd.', 'What\u2019s more, firmer $60 oil prices will bolster the troubled finances of fringe U.S. shale players desperately looking to balance their books. It would even prompt Russia, Saudi Arabia and others within OPEC+ to monetize their barrels better, and more of them.', 'However, that won\u2019t stop speculative punts given that both Trump and Iran have their own respective idiosyncratic unpredictability. Additionally, unlike the outage caused by Abqaiq attacks, in this case there is no quick fix. But whichever way you look at it \u2013 more speculation and more oil barrels are imminent.', '\\nSource: Forbes']"

    "title": "This Iran Crisis Presents A Different Kind Of Test For Publicly Traded Aramco",
    "content": "['Long before Saudi Aramco finally made its initial public offering in December, the big question\u2014bigger than the valuation\u2014was: How would Aramco shares be treated by the market?', 'How would the market assess, in real time, an energy company that is disproportionately weighted toward upstream operations in single country, in a volatile region, and with an absolute monarchy that may exert unforeseen control? Would investors treat it like an international oil company (IOC), such as Exxon, Chevron or BP? Or would the market judge the company\u2019s shares based on unprecedented criteria?', 'Aramco trades on Tadawul, the local Saudi exchange, so the market for it is relatively muted. Nevertheless, it has entered the portfolios of international investors through funds, including the indexes MSCI and FTSE which have incorporated Tadawul. To some extent, Aramco\u2019s shares are still not available to a large enough swath of investors and public trading is still too new to determine exactly how the market sees Aramco. After all, the stabilization period does not end until later this week. On the other hand, the recent dustup between the United States and Iran gives a very useful test for how investors see the Saudi oil firm, and it makes a compelling case that Aramco is an entirely new type of oil business in the eyes of the market.', 'Typically, the value of shares of IOC\u2019s rise when the price of oil rises. They make more money when they can sell oil for more money. This is the case even if the cause for the rise in oil prices is a conflict or disaster. For instance, when a hurricane comes barreling into the Gulf of Mexico, there is often fear of damage to offshore drilling platforms. But when the hurricane results in higher oil prices due to production disruptions (or the fear of disruptions), the oil companies see their own stock prices rise.', 'Similarly, as the tensions and then actual conflict between the U.S. and Iran escalated from a killed U.S. contractor to targeted bombings to an assault on an embassy to the elimination of a top Iranian general, the values of shares of bellwether IOC\u2019s like Exxon and BP rose. At the start of trading in New York on New Years Eve, BP was at $37.41. By the start of trading on Monday, January 6, it was $39.68, an increase of more than 6%. Exxon increased from $69.02 to $70.3 (1.9%) in that period. Chevron went up from $119.5 to $121.24 (1.5%) in that period. It makes sense that these shares rose, because oil was becoming more valuable and their daily profits rose.', 'Aramco is different. Tadawul is closed on Fridays, so it was not open right after news broke of the American airstrike that killed Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, but Tadawul is open on Sundays. On Sunday and Monday, even with the price of oil rising, Aramco stock dropped from 35 SAR to 34.05 SAR, before rising to 34.5 SAR before closing. (Remember, Aramco is still within its stabilization period after the IPO, so there may be efforts to keep its price from falling).', 'While the IOCs rose on the news of geopolitical tension and higher oil prices, Aramco\u2019s price fell. This is likely due, in large part, to the fear that Aramco facilities could be targets for Iranian reprisal, just as Aramco facilities were targeted in September and have been targeted by Houthi forces in Yemen for the past couple of years. But these past attacks on Aramco have never really interfered with the company\u2019s ability to make a huge profit. Should Aramco be treated much differently now than an IOC with offshore assets is treated as a hurricane approaches the Gulf of Mexico? Apparently, the market believes so.', 'It will also be important to see how the market deals with the next scandal, political crackdown or human rights issue out of Saudi Arabia. The company is so closely tied to the government and its unique absolute monarchy, that we really don\u2019t know how the equities market will treat a publicly traded Aramco in relation to political events in the kingdom.', 'It seems the market is still trying to determine what criteria to use to price Aramco, an upstream-heavy oil company with all of its reserves in one small location in the middle of a tense region and an interconnection with an absolute monarchy. But this past week has demonstrated that, at least for the time being, it will not price Aramco based on the price of oil.', '\\nSource: Forbes']"

Its $1.1 trillion sovereign-wealth fund (locally dubbed the oil fund) has tried to exit fossil-fuel stocks. But Norway has so far proved unable to wean itself off oil.', 'Calls from activists and some politicians for an end date to oil production are growing more frequent. Meanwhile, uncertainty over key parameters such as industry taxes has grown.', 'Equinor stressed that its emission cuts depend on stable framework conditions. In an interview, Saetre said he hopes the steps Equinor is taking will \u201cstrengthen and make more robust the political support the industry has enjoyed.\u201d', '\u201cThis is something we don\u2019t wish to be dragged into,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to be at the forefront and the driver\u2019s seat.\u201d', 'Equinor and its partners plan to invest about 50 billion kroner ($5.7 billion) to reach a first target to cut emissions by 40% by 2030. That will mostly be done by connecting offshore platforms and onshore plants to Norway\u2019s electricity grid, which is dominated by clean hydropower. Reductions will then reach 70% in 2040 and almost 100% by 2050.', 'Though the investment needed to switch to clean energy in the production stage will have a \u201cneutral to positive net present value,\u201d Saetre said the expectation is that Equinor will become more cost competitive over time, as carbon pricing increases.', 'Good Enough?', 'Equinor\u2019s efforts to reduce its carbon footprint will bring it in line with the overall climate goals of Norway, which is a signatory of the Paris Agreement. But the measures are unlikely to satisfy drilling opponents, given that the cuts do nothing to address emissions from the oil\u2019s combustion, which makes up more than 90% of the total.', '\u201cThese ambitions ignore the elephant in the room,\u201d said Mark van Baal, the head of Dutch investor advocacy group Follow This. \u201cAn oil company with targets for its own emissions, and not for its products, is like a cigarette producer that promises that all employees will quit smoking, while increasing cigarette production.\u201d', 'A good illustration of why activists are concerned can be found in the giant Johan Sverdrup field in the North Sea, which is being officially opened on Tuesday by Prime Minister Erna Solberg. It\u2019s slated to continue pumping oil for several decades after starting in October. Emissions from the field are way lower than those elsewhere in the industry, at less than 1 kilogram of CO2 for each barrel that\u2019s produced. But emissions from the oil itself, if all 2.7 billion barrels are used, would amount to more than 20 times the annual total for Norway.', 'The new targets \u201cwill obviously have a positive reputation effect in Norway,\u201d said Klaus Mohn, an economics professor at the University of Stavanger. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it will be enough to calm the debate about the industry\u2019s future.\u201d', '\\nSource: Bloomberg']"

Oil traders are now weighing the scale and ferocity of Tehran\u2019s inevitable response.', 'Higher prices reflect the fear that Iran will lash out immediately at the oil facilities of its enemies in the region, or hit tanker traffic in the Strait of Hormuz. However, a broader direct military confrontation between the US and Tehran in the Middle East would have an even bigger impact on energy trade flows in a region that produces a fifth of the world\u2019s oil.', '\u201cIran will have to retaliate in some form or another,\u201d said Anoush Ehteshami, professor of international relations at Durham University and a regional expert. \u201cSoleimani was no ordinary figure, and the charisma he carried in the region cannot be underestimated. I would expect a wave of reaction across the Middle East, but I don\u2019t think they will target oil.\u201d', 'As head of the elite Quds brigade of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corp, Soleimani was seen as the biggest single threat to US foreign policy interests in the region.', 'An architect of Tehran\u2019s military strategy to extend its influence in Iraq, Syria, Yemen and the Lebanon, he rose to prominence during the Iran -Iraq war in the early 80s. A close ally of Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, his death \u201cleaves the regime in a precarious position and only reinforces the \u2018martyrdom\u2019 narrative,\u201d Ehteshami said.', 'Pushed into a corner, Iran may seek to directly confront the US militarily, or more likely stoke anti-American sentiment amongst its Shiite Muslim allies.', '\u201cThe risk of major escalation has moved into new territory, but we still put the odds of a broader US -Iran conflict below 50/50,\u201d according to S&P Global Platts Analytics. Of course, any disruptions from conflict would be covered by OPEC, which has over 2 million b/d of spare capacity.', 'Middle East tensions rise', '\\nTensions and security are already high around oil, which has become a target over the last 12 months in the Persian Gulf and its key shipping lanes.', 'Iran and the militia it supports were blamed for attacks on Saudi Arabia\u2019s giant Abqaiq and Khurais oil plants last September and a series of unproven strikes earlier in the year on tankers anchored near the mouth of the Persian Gulf or in the Red Sea. Abqaiq, the worst of the attacks, shut in 5.7 million b/d of production and forced the world\u2019s largest exporter to draw on its emergency reserves.', 'Security has since been stepped up at oilfields across the Gulf, but the attacks have demonstrated how vulnerable these facilities remain.', 'US diplomatic efforts to muster an international force to help protect the Strait of Hormuz from Iranian threats has received a tepid response. Despite these fears, seasoned energy industry veterans in the region are skeptical of a further escalation hitting the Middle East\u2019s flows of crude.', '\u201cIt won\u2019t affect oil supply from the region, but the real impact will be psychological,\u201d said Abdullah bin Hamad al -Attiyah, former OPEC president and previously Qatar\u2019s longest serving energy minister, in a phone interview from Doha. \u201cIt will bring the speculators back to the oil market.\u201d', 'A risky strategy', '\\nEliminating one of America\u2019s most ardent enemies within the Iranian regime by drone strike is a risky strategy for US President Donald Trump to take. A war with Iran could be ruinous for his re-election hopes in 2020 if higher oil prices push the cost of gasoline well above $3/gal.', 'However, oil market fundamentals appear to be in Trump\u2019s favor. S&P Global Platts Analytics expects more oil supplies to come on stream this year in Brazil, Norway and Canada, adding to stockpiles.', 'Of more immediate concern will be the threat to American nationals and US oil companies operating across the Middle East, which could now be targeted directly by Tehran, or its proxies in revenge attacks.', 'Exxon Mobil, the largest US international oil company and operator of the giant West Qurna field in southern Iraq, said it was \u201cclosely monitoring the situation\u201d in the wake of Soleimani\u2019s death.', 'The US government told its citizens to leave Iraq immediately.', '\u201cThe problem now in the Middle East is the spread of small wars everywhere,\u201d said Al -Attiyah, who now heads the Abdullah bin Hamad Al -Attiyah International Foundation for Energy & Sustainable Development. \u201cYou can see it in Sudan, in Yemen, Libya, in Syria and Iraq.\u201d', 'However, Trump\u2019s advisors may hope Soleimani\u2019s death adds to the pressure building on the Iranian regime to eventually negotiate a new nuclear deal with the US on Washington\u2019s own terms and rein in its regional meddling especially in Iraq.', 'Sanctions have already reduced the country\u2019s oil production to its lowest level in 30 years. The loss of oil income has crippled the economy, triggering street riots late last year after the government was forced to increase subsidized fuel prices. Its currency has halved in value and GDP fell by more than 9% last year.', '\u201cSoleimani was essential for Khamenei\u2019s regional policies,\u201d said Ehteshami.

Tensions in the Middle East escalate to a fever pitch, one side strikes a stunning blow in the never-ending \u201cshadow war\u201d against American hegemony in the oil-rich region, and crude prices spike on fears of an oil shortage. ', 'But then tensions calm, the oil keeps flowing and prices come back to earth.', 'As the unprecedented attacks on key Saudi Arabia oil facilities showed last September, it\u2019s not easy in this era of abundance to establish a geopolitical risk premium in global oil markets or sustain a price rally.', 'That\u2019s why those traders betting on higher oil prices after Friday\u2019s killing of Gen. Qassem Soleimani, Iran\u2019s most senior military commander, in a U.S. drone attack in Iraq should err on the side of caution.', 'Iran has pledged to retaliate, and it showed last year that it can significantly disrupt Middle East oil markets in several ways, including pestering tankers in the Strait of Hormuz, hitting critical pipelines and ports, and, most spectacularly, attacking Saudi oil fields and facilities, an event that temporarily halved Saudi oil production.', 'But perhaps the most telling story of oil markets in 2019 was how quickly oil prices retreated to pre-attack levels in the days following that September 14 attack. ', 'A well-supplied oil market, both in terms of spare production capacity and inventories, rendered the attacks a virtual non-event. That\u2019s incredible given that the loss of production from OPEC-leader Saudi Arabia \u2013 known as the world\u2019s \u201ccentral banker\u201d for oil \u2013 was, in the past, considered a doomsday scenario by veteran oil analysts.', 'Sure enough, the price of oil on the international benchmark Brent hub pushed higher on Friday, at one point peaking at $69.50 \u2013 its highest level since the Saudi oil facilities were attacked. But gains were quickly pared as the session wore on, with the price closing up around $2 at over $68 a barrel.', 'There are some reasons to believe that \u201cthis time will be different\u201d and that a real risk premium of perhaps $3 to $5 a barrel could now be built into oil prices. ', 'Unlike in September, oil prices at the end of the year were on a roll before the January 3 killing of Soleimani, boosted by OPEC\u2019s latest supply cut deal and an improved global demand outlook as a result of the phase one trade deal between the U.S. and China. ', 'Another factor favoring higher prices is the slowing of U.S. shale oil production growth. That would be sufficient in a normal market to prompt a rally in oil prices if retaliations escalate between Tehran and Washington. The reality, though, is that it may take a full-blown war in the region to make oil prices move substantially higher \u2013 such is the extent of the oversupply of oil in the market at the moment.', 'Even with the combined effect of slower non-OPEC production growth and deeper OPEC cuts, the International Energy Agency recently stated there could still be a surplus of 700,000 barrels a day in the global oil market in the first quarter. Other analysts see the surplus in the first half at 1 million barrels a day or higher.  ', 'It\u2019s important to remember that Saudi-led OPEC and its allies are deliberately holding back roughly 2 million barrels a day of production to make room for still growing non-OPEC supplies, to keep oil markets balanced and support oil prices.', 'That is 2 million barrels a day that could be brought on virtually overnight if necessary. ', 'The IEA assesses global spare capacity at roughly 3.1 million barrels a day, of which some 2.1 million barrels a day is in Saudi Arabia. Another source of supply resilience is due to come online later this year when the Wafra and Khafji fields in the Saudi Arabia-Kuwait \u201cneutral zone\u201d return, adding roughly 500,000 barrels a day.', 'Of course, that\u2019s contingent on oil capacity in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Kuwait \u2013 all U.S. allies \u2013 remaining unaffected. That remains an unknown as Iran looks for targets to retaliate against without directly attacking U.S. forces. ', 'Tehran may well believe it has to respond to the U.S. drone attacks to save face with hardliners within its government \u2013Soleimani was immensely popular. But Iran is typically strategic in its attacks on the West, depending on proxies in Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen to give it deniability.  ', 'But there are also roughly 3 million barrels a day being held back by U.S. sanctions and civil strife. Sanctions on Iran and Venezuela won\u2019t ease anytime soon, but the output from conflict-stricken nations like Libya, Nigeria, South Sudan, Yemen and Syria could increase if political and security conditions in those states improve.', 'That is a massive amount of spare capacity \u2013 even if some of it can\u2019t be tapped immediately, it has a significant effect on oil-market psychology.', 'The supply cushion doesn\u2019t end there either. Consumer nations around the world have built up massive inventories of crude oil and petroleum products, both in commercial and strategic stockpiles. Many import-dependent Asian countries have been preparing for a supply disruption in the  Middle East since tensions with Iran started escalating last Spring. ', 'As of November, the IEA gauged OECD commercial petroleum inventories at roughly 2.9 billion barrels, equivalent to the trailing 12-month average and enough to cover about 60 days of demand.', 'Meanwhile, strategic petroleum reserves in the OECD are 1.5 billion barrels, and China is believed to now have around 1 billion barrels stockpiled \u2013 enough to cover more than 80 days of demand. All that surplus oil is helping to offset geopolitical fears. The bottom line is that the world should have more than sufficient crude oil on hand to cope with any slowdown caused by Iran.', 'Another important factor that shouldn\u2019t be discounted is the United States\u2019 recent transformation into a net exporter of petroleum after decades of being a major importer. The combination of a decade of rising production thanks to the shale boom and growing exports of refined petroleum products, has redrawn long-standing oil trade patterns and reduced dependence on Mideast oil significantly for many big consumer nations. ', 'The very fact that the Trump administration can challenge Iran so aggressively is because the United States \u2013 and the global economy \u2013 is no longer beholden to Mideast oil as it was in the past. ', 'None of this is to say that recent events can\u2019t have a significant impact on oil markets. ', 'All-out war in the Middle East between Iran and its many proxies and the United States and its allies in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Kuwait, and Israel, would be an extremely messy affair. Iran already targeted oil facilities and shipping lanes before the killing of Soleimani. And the front line of any conflict may very well be Saudi Arabia and Iraq \u2013 OPEC\u2019s two largest oil producers. ', 'That can\u2019t be discounted. ', 'But with non-OPEC oil supplies growing rapidly, and an ample spare capacity cushion and huge oil inventories to lean on, the market looks well-prepared for whatever tomorrow brings.', '\\nSource: Forbes']"

By 2030 this implies annual cuts of more than 5 million tonnes, corresponding to around 10% of Norway\u2019s total CO2 emissions.', '\u201cEquinor supports the Paris agreement and a net zero target for society. We have already brought CO2-emissions in the production process down to industry leading levels. We are now launching an unprecedented set of ambitions for forceful industrial action and substantial absolute emission reductions in Norway, aiming towards near zero in 2050. This is in line with society\u2019s climate targets and our strategy to create high value with low emissions,\u201d says Eldar S\u00e6tre, CEO of Equinor.', '\u201cWhile realizing these ambitions, we also expect our operated fields and plants to create significant value with a potential to generate more than 3.000 billion Norwegian kroner in income for the Norwegian State towards 2030. New fields, field life extensions, improved oil and gas recovery and efficient operations will all contribute to substantial value creation. The new climate ambitions will strengthen future competitiveness and value creation for Equinor, while supporting industrial developments in Norway,\u201d says S\u00e6tre.', '\u201cCollaboration is key to combat climate change. We appreciate the close cooperation with our industry partners and suppliers, and to realise these ambitions we need even closer collaboration across industries and with authorities. We plan investments in the order of 50 billion Norwegian kroner together with our partners by 2030 to cut emissions in order to strengthen the long-term competitiveness for our fields and plants. In setting these ambitions Equinor has assumed stable framework conditions and necessary investments in the electricity grid,\u201d says S\u00e6tre.', 'The first phase of the plan to reduce emissions by 2030 means more than 5 million tonnes in annual reductions, representing around 10% of total annual Norwegian greenhouse gas emissions today. Similar as for the EU ETS targets, 2005 is used as a baseline for emissions reductions.', 'Total emissions for Equinor operated fields and plants in 2018 were around 13 million tonnes, approximately the same level as in 2005. The ambition will cover all greenhouse gas emissions from offshore fields and onshore plants operated by Equinor in Norway, including both Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions of CO2 and methane. Since methane emissions are very low at the Norwegian continental shelf, the CO2-emissions is the predominant part.', 'A 40% reduction by 2030 will be realised through large scale industrial measures, including energy efficiency, digitalisation and the launch of several electrification projects at key fields and plants, including the Troll and Oseberg offshore fields and the Hammerfest LNG plant.', 'The 2030 ambition will require investments of around NOK 50 billion for Equinor and its partners. Subject to positive investment decisions in the licenses, these investments will have neutral to positive net present value, in addition to strengthening future competitiveness.', 'Further reduction ambitions towards 70% in 2040 and close to zero in 2050 will entail additional measures, further electrification projects, consolidation of infrastructure as well as opportunities to develop new technologies and value chains.', 'In 2050, Equinor expects Norwegian oil and gas production to be less than half of current levels, assuming development of the defined projects ahead of us, substantial efforts to increase production from existing fields and continued exploration.', 'Equinor aims to utilize its capabilities within innovation, technology and large-scale industrial solutions to develop new competitive value chains. Currently Equinor is pursuing and maturing opportunities within offshore wind, carbon capture and storage and emissions-free hydrogen based on natural gas.', 'The ambitions will support the development of new value chains within hydrogen and carbon capture and storage and help ensure that the Norwegian continental shelf and onshore plants can play an important role and create value in a world with net zero emissions.', 'In setting ambitions for substantial cuts towards close to zero emissions in 2050, Equinor has assumed stable Norwegian framework conditions, including the tax system, and necessary investments in the onshore electricity grid. A continuation of the industry\u2019s NOX-fund and other positive measures can support substantial emissions reduction.', 'Setting ambitions for substantial cuts in emissions in Norway is an important step in aligning Equinor\u2019s business with the Paris Agreement. Equinor will present new corporate climate ambitions and a holistic climate platform, including an approach to decarbonisation and life cycle emissions, at the Capital Markets Update in February.', '\\nSource: Equinor']"

But within this sector, the midstream corporations turned in outstanding performances, while the midstream companies that are structured as master limited partnerships (MLPs) generally lagged behind.', 'The Top 20 midstream companies rose by an average of 15.9% for the year, but a different picture emerges if we look at just the midstream corporations. Major midstream corporations like Enbridge, TC Energy (formerly TransCanada), and Kinder Morgan respectively returned 36%, 56%, and 44%. Enterprise Products Partners, the largest MLP, returned 21.9%. TC Energy\u2019s return was the best among the Top 20 midstream companies.', 'The integrated supermajors returned an average of 2.3% for the quarter, and 8.8% for the year.

For the year, this group returned 9.6%.', 'In general, the Canadian upstream companies handily outperformed their U.S. peers, with many turning in gains of over 30%. However, the top performer in the Top 20 was U.S.-based Hess, with a 68% return for the year. At the bottom of the pack was Occidental\u2019s 28% decline for the year.

In the 1990s, international sanctions and the United Nations Oil For Food program limited the sale of Iraqi oil.

At Gemasolar they create electricity even when the Sun is not shining.', 'They have rigged up more than 2,500 huge mirrors on hydraulic mounts that follow the Sun\u2019s passage through the sky.', 'The mirrors \u2013 each about the size of half a tennis court \u2013 reflect the Sun\u2019s rays to one central point, the top of a 140m (459ft) tower, where molten salt is heated to almost 600C. This liquid salt is carried down the tower to where it heats the steam that powers a turbine.', 'And here\u2019s the trick: not all the salt is used at that point. Some is stored in huge tanks and used later when the Sun has gone down. So long as the Sun shines every day, the plant can generate power 24/7.', 'I tell you this not just as an illustration of how fast renewable technology is changing \u2013 this particular innovation is not that new \u2013 but also as an example of how electrified our energy is set to become.', 'The expansion of electric vehicles is predicted to accelerate significantly, to a point when it will become the norm rather than the exception.', 'Battery technology still has far to go but many scientists and businesses are competing to find ways of storing electrical power that is lighter and longer-lasting. Already some electrically powered passenger aircraft are in production. How long before ships can be powered by batteries rather than fuel oil?', 'The obvious and much-contested question is when this renewable revolution will reach its peak and whether it will come in time to protect the planet from global warming. That is not something I am qualified to answer.', 'What interests me is a separate question: what impact might this new technology have, not on the world\u2019s climate, but its politics?', 'What happens to the global balance of political power when so many countries no longer need to buy so much oil and gas? This is a question that Adam Bowen and I have sought to answer in a documentary for the BBC World Service and Radio Four.', 'For more than a century, nations that had oil and gas had power, literally and politically. Wars were fought over the stuff.', 'It all began before the World War One when Winston Churchill \u2013 as First Lord of the Admiralty \u2013 converted the British navy from Welsh coal to imported oil.', 'To secure British access to that oil, the future British prime minister bought a controlling stake in the Anglo Persian oil company, the forerunner of BP, in what is now Iran.', 'From that moment, much of the history of the 20th Century can be seen through countries\u2019 pursuit of hydrocarbons, from Adolf Hitler\u2019s attempts to secure the Baku oil fields to Saddam Hussein\u2019s invasion of Kuwait to last September\u2019s drone and missile attack on Saudi oil facilities.', 'Countries with oil and gas used their monopolies to sell the stuff for huge profits; those countries which relied on it spent much blood and treasure defending their access to it.', 'The question is how much the renewable revolution might change this geopolitical equation. How much influence will be lost by some of the world\u2019s big fossil fuel producers, in the Middle East, Africa and elsewhere?', 'Might there be more regional conflict as these countries fight over an ever-decreasing share of the hydrocarbon energy market? And what might happen to these countries internally if they lose their main source of revenue?', 'Often these are nations have huge state-led economies, with many workers employed by governments, with youthful populations accustomed to cheap fuel.', 'There is little consensus over when the transition from fossil fuels to clean energy will take place. There are many different predictions about when global demand for oil will peak and fall away but the planners at Shell recently forecast it could happen as early as 2025.', 'So some oil-producing countries are playing safe and preparing for the moment when they can no longer rely on oil. They are looking to diversify their economies and find other sources of energy.', 'But other countries are more sceptical, trusting that demand for their oil and gas will last for some time.', 'Some of these countries stand accused of talking about diversification but doing little about it. The potential consequences of this are becoming an increasing source of concern.', 'This is what Prof Paul Stevens, distinguished fellow at the UK foreign affairs think tank Chatham House, told the BBC: \u201cThe oil producing government gets revenue; if that revenue falls or disappears, the government is no longer able to sustain the non-oil sector, which means you will have rising unemployment, you will no longer be able to pay subsidies to keep your population happy.', '\u201cMany of the large oil and gas exporters are what might politely be described as politically unstable. So the faster the transition [to renewables], the greater the fall in gas and oil revenues, the more disruptive it is going to be and so you are looking at potentially a large number of failed states.\u201d', 'This is what Tom Burke, chairman of the E3G environmental think tank and a former UK government adviser says: \u201cIf you can\u2019t deliver food, energy and water security, as we have seen across the Middle East, it is pretty difficult to deliver internal stability. Urban populations, when you fail to meet their expectations, riot. You could have the basic structures of the state fall apart.', '\u201cBut much more than that, when people riot or look like they might riot, what tends to happen in those situations in countries is they seek foreign adventures in order to distract people from their unmet expectations.\u201d', 'So just imagine a currently stable oil-producing country in the Gulf that suddenly becomes a failed state. Not only would this be a disaster for the country itself, but it could also have huge implications for the world.', 'Failed states often become the homes to extremist violence \u2013 think Syria \u2013 and they often produce mass migration.', 'This potential disruption might not be confined to the Gulf. Russia is one of the biggest exporters of oil and gas in the world. Its economy and its government depend hugely on the revenues this brings in. Little wonder that President Putin describes the development of \u201cgreen technologies\u201d as a one of the \u201cmain challenges and threats\u201d to Russia\u2019s economic security.', 'Many Russians remember that falling oil prices contributed to the collapse of the Soviet Union. But the current government is investing little in alternative renewable energies. If one day the world needs to buy less Russian gas, that could have a huge impact on the stability of the Russian state and could transform its relations with Europe.', 'There are other potential sources of tension and conflict in a world of clean energy.', 'There could be a race to secure access to minerals such as cobalt and lithium which are vital for batteries and can be rare. Much of the world\u2019s best cobalt is located in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) which has a history of instability and poor governance.', 'At the same time, the new so-called super grids through which electricity will flow between countries will be more vulnerable to cyber-attack.', 'An interesting question is how environmental campaigners should respond to the political risks involved in the move towards renewable energy.', 'Should those potential downsides be taken into account or is the need to protect the world from climate change so paramount that all other considerations are secondary? How might public opinion be affected if reducing global warming meant more terrorism and migration?', 'These, of course, are some of the worst-case scenarios. There are many potential positives.', 'When the transition to renewables takes place, countries that were previously energy dependent will be able to produce their own power. One of the advantages of renewables is that many more countries have the ability to generate clean energy.', 'Some countries with lots of sun, wind or tide could not only become self-sufficient but could also export some of their energy via huge so-called interconnectors. There may be something of a peace dividend: if the world no longer needs so much oil passing through the Strait of Hormuz each day, then perhaps they will not need such large armies and navies to defend it?', 'To a large extent, the geopolitics of energy may cease to be so significant. As Prof Stevens says, people will still find things to kill each other over, such as food and water.', 'But energy, maybe not so much.', '\\nSource: BBC']"

That\u2019s a potential cash-flow boost that they didn\u2019t have two weeks ago, he said.', 'Notes issued by some of the weakest energy companies led the biggest gainers in high-yield bond indexes on Friday after reports that Iranian General Qassem Soleimani was killed in a drone attack authorized by President Donald Trump. West Texas Intermediate oil reached its highest level since September at about $62 a barrel', '\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that any of these companies that were distressed are going to be suddenly rolling in cash,\u201d Cutter said in an interview. \u201cBut it does give them a bit of a lifeline.\u201d', 'Representatives for Whiting and California Resources didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment. Whiting\u2019s unsecured 2023 notes rose 2.75 cents to 87.5 cents on the dollar, their best level since August, and second-priority notes due 2022 issued by California Resources soared above 50 cents for the first time since September.', 'Energy companies are the largest cohort of the U.S. distressed-debt universe, according to Bloomberg Intelligence, and they were the biggest source of defaults in 2019, S&P Global Ratings reported. Companies in that sector went bankrupt in 2019 at the fastest pace since the 2015-2016 slump that claimed more than 200 producers and servicers.', 'The sector never showed a meaningful recovery as record oil production kept prices muted, so any sign of reduced output from the Middle East could benefit U.S. producers and the balance sheets of the weakest companies. Even companies that already went bankrupt could be helped if rising prices boost assets and cash flow projections, giving creditors a bigger pie to divide up.', 'More Drilling?', 'Oil producers are evaluating their capital spending budgets for the year, and increased cash flows in 2020 from higher oil hedges could tempt them to boost production, Cutter said.', 'Investors have pressured oil companies in recent years to spend within their means, and the most troubled companies haven\u2019t been able to increase production. But drilling more wells isn\u2019t necessarily good for distressed-energy bondholders, Cutter said.', '\u201cIf you\u2019re a bondholder, you see this as a nice little windfall and you can get more mileage from a credit perspective by paying down debt,\u201d he said. It\u2019s also not good for distressed companies focused on natural gas because more oil production means more natural gas flooding an already saturated market.', 'More energy companies may also look to follow Chesapeake Energy Corp.\u2019s refinancing deal that allowed it to stave off immediate bankruptcy. Higher oil prices are unlikely to spur new issuance for capital spending or acquisitions, but companies may be able to persuade investors to give them more time to pay off their debts, Cutter said.', 'It\u2019s too early to say whether Friday\u2019s oil rally will last.

While Trump is still favorite, we still could see a progressive candidate come out with the nomination. It would be bad news for the US oil industry.\u201d', 'Among the highest polling candidates, populists Senator Elizabeth Warren (D, MA) and Bernie Sanders (I, VT) have pushed hardest for policies aimed at severely limiting the US oil sector, including a ban on exports, fracking and leasing on federal waters. Other candidates, including frontrunner Senator Joe Biden (D, DE), have taken a more measured approach, not committing to all-out bans, but indicating that new limits and additional regulation would be considered.', '\u201cIf [President Donald] Trump wins it is status quo, but any Democrat \u2013 even if it\u2019s not a populist \u2013 would be under tremendous pressure to throw the base a bone and this is a bone they could throw,\u201d Confluence Investment Management chief market strategist Bill O\u2019Grady said.', 'US oil output has surged in recent years following the lifting of a decades-old crude oil export ban in late 2015 that allowed producers to ship surplus barrels abroad. Previously, most US production had to be consumed domestically by refineries, the bulk of which are tooled to run cheaper heavy, sour crude imports from the Middle East and Venezuela. This limited domestic appetite effectively put a ceiling on the mostly light, sweet crudes being produced in the Permian and other tight oil plays.', 'The build-out of significant US Gulf Coast pipeline infrastructure during the Trump administration further incentivized US production by de-bottlenecking West Texas oil plays and propelled US crude output and exports to records heights in 2019. US crude production steadily increased in 2019 to more than 12.8 million b/d in December from around 11.8 million b/d in January, and exports soared to a weekly peak of 4.46 million b/d in late December, according to US Energy Information Administration.', 'OUTPUT GROWTH SLOWING', '\\nUS output growth is already slowing, with producers unwilling to boost spending and drilling at current prices, and capital drying up. A recent Dallas Federal Reserve survey showed the industry is already concerned about increasingly limited access to capital, stagnant prices and looming bankruptcies in the Permian and other US shale plays.', '\u201cIf Trump wins, it\u2019s helpful for oil supplies in the short run,\u201d O\u2019Grady said. \u201cThe market would take a populist victory as bearish for oil stocks, but probably bullish for prices as it would reduce supply.\u201d', 'On average about a quarter of US crude production has been exported each week in 2019. With US refineries maxed out on how much light sweet crude that they are willing to take, an export ban would likely flood local storage capacity and force producers to cut output or risk glutting the market.', '\u201c[A Democrat] wouldn\u2019t have Congressional support across the board so some restrictions might be hampered, but I think you would see further consolidation in the industry, and even the mention of an export ban would weigh on the sector,\u201d Moya said.', 'Crude export facilities along the US Gulf Coast have grown their capacity to export from about 5.4 million b/d at the start of 2019 to a current estimate of about 7.7 million b/d, according to S&P Global Platts Analytics. And that capacity will likely grow to over 8 million b/d in 2020, as several major infrastructure projects are expected to start up.', 'Oil commodity markets are so far not yet pricing-in these policy risks, analysts said, but volatility is expected to increase during the second half of the year as the November election draws closer. Instead these risks have mostly manifested in the energy equity space.', 'Energy stocks have struggled to keep up with an equity price boom. The S&P 500 Energy Index finished 2019 around 5.5 % higher, compared to a nearly 29% annual increase in the broader S&P 500 Index, S&P Global Platts data shows.', '\u201cEnergy equities have been a real laggard this year, we have come to the conclusion that this is not a one off, but part of a broader trend. If energy stocks continue to languish, we probably will see drilling activity roll over, oil stocks tighten and prices rise,\u201d O\u2019Grady said. \u201cThis looks like a direction thing, this election could accelerate or decelerate this process, but I think this trend is in place.

Last night\u2019s U.S. attack, killing the leader of the IRGC Quds Force, was described as pre-emptive self-defense designed to deter future Iranian or Iranian-supported attacks. Iran will see its response in similar terms: a need to demonstrate to Washington that the U.S. cannot kill senior Iranian leaders without paying a significant price. At this moment, we expect retaliation to be in the region, most likely in Iraq. This could have significant impact on crude oil prices. Statements that the oil market has tremendous spare capacity and can easily weather a new disruption are glib and misleading. An extended period of conflict in the region will support prices by fueling uncertainty, even as alternative suppliers step up.', 'Last night outside of the Baghdad airport, the U.S. attacked and killed the head of Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards Quds Force Qassim Soleimani and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the deputy head of the Iranian-backed Popular Mobilization Forces in Iraq. Soleimani was one of the most powerful and influential figures in Iran\u2019s government. U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper stated that the U.S. strike was \u201caimed at deterring future Iranian attack plans.\u201d Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told foreign counterparts that \u201cthe U.S. remains committed to de-escalation.\u201d Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has vowed \u201csevere revenge.\u201d', 'The U.S. has framed its attack as pre-emptive self-defense designed to deter future Iranian or Iranian-supported attacks. Iran will see its response in similar terms: a need to demonstrate to Washington that the U.S. cannot kill senior Iranian leaders without paying a significant price. Iran\u2019s overriding goals vis-\u00e0-vis Washington remain the same: to reduce U.S. influence in the Middle East and to get out from under sanctions. Layered on top of this now is the requirement to demonstrate to Washington and its own people that the Iranian government can defend itself. Defense, in this case, very likely means retaliation. Iran has a range of targets available: U.S. forces in the region, U.S. embassies and diplomatic personnel worldwide, U.S. citizens abroad, and U.S. partners and allies and their citizens and infrastructure. An attack may not be immediate; Iran has lost its lead planner and operational commander. But it will almost certainly occur.', 'In addition to any kinetic response or responses, Iran will want the Iraqi government to demand that remaining U.S. forces leave Iraq, and Tehran will use the incident to consolidate recently shaky domestic support within Iran. Escalation spirals are very possible. Despite Secretary Pompeo\u2019s words, Washington may feel compelled to respond to any future Iranian attack. In addition, U.S. and Iranian forces \u2013 operating in close proximity in the region \u2013 will be on very high alert and local commanders may take actions that spark a clash. Iranian allies, such as Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah or militia forces in Iraq, may act on their own against U.S. targets. Finally, this attack will almost certainly have a significant impact on Iran\u2019s beliefs about the need for it to develop a nuclear weapons capability.', 'For the moment, we expect the next Iranian response to be in the region. The implications for the crude oil market revolve primarily around (1.) the possibility of further military action impacting oil operations in Iraq, including the country\u2019s 4.6 million b/d of crude oil production and almost 4.0 million b/d of crude oil exports.

Enverus tracked $96 billion of U.S. oil & gas M&A in 2019, including $11 billion in Q4. However, the annual total was substantially skewed by Occidental\u2019s $57 billion acquisition of Anadarko, which was also the largest deal of the decade and the fourth largest oil & gas deal ever.', 'Backing out the Occidental/Anadarko deal, 2019 saw $39 billion in deals or just one-half of the average $78 billion for annual U.S. oil & gas M&A during the last 10 years, which also saw the rise of U.S. unconventional assets. M&A played a key role along the way, with $567 billion spent on shale assets or 73% of the total during that time. E&Ps poured even more into funding drilling, including major ramp ups of oil output in the Bakken, Eagle Ford, and Permian Basin. However, the available capital that made shale possible largely dried up in 2019.', 'Top Five Deals of 2019', '\u201cInvestors who funded the shale revolution over the last decade have become vocal in advocating for payouts and cut back on providing new capital. That flowed through to limited M&A and a negative reaction to deals for much of the year,\u201d said Enverus Senior M&A Analyst, Andrew Dittmar. \u201cHowever, we saw an uptick in December in the pace of deals and more positive investor reactions to acquisitions. That should bode well for M&A in 2020.\u201d', 'Occidental\u2019s acquisition of Anadarko highlighted 2019\u2019s consolidation in the shale patch. The deal is in the ballpark of Exxon\u2019s 2009 acquisition of XTO as the most spent on shale in a deal. Occidental saw 75% of Anadarko\u2019s value in shale, including the Permian Basin.', 'Most of 2019\u2019s other marquee deals also focused on the Permian. After Occidental/Anadarko, 2019\u2019s largest corporate deals were Callon\u2019s $2.7 billion merger with Carrizo, WPX\u2019s $2.5 billion buy of private Felix Energy II, and Parsley\u2019s $2.3 billion acquisition of Jagged Peak.', 'WPX\u2019s $2.5 billion acquisition of EnCap-funded Felix in December 2019 was notable for several reasons. Besides being the largest deal of Q4 and fourth largest deal of 2019, the acquisition of a premier private equity position in the Permian shows there are still exits available for the \u201cbuilt to sell\u201d model of private equity portfolio companies. WPX also outperformed the broader markets on news of the deal, compared to most buyers being sold off on news of M&A.', 'Top Five Deals of Q4 2019', 'The Permian continues to be a key driver of U.S. oil growth and a significant contributor to M&A including accounting for more than 60% of Q4 2019 value. From a buyer\u2019s perspective, there are opportunities to shop for private equity portfolio companies that are ready for an exit or acquire the small and mid-cap public companies that have been beat up on Wall Street.', 'During the second half of 2019, smaller E&Ps showed an increasing willingness to accept lower buyout values as capital markets remained tight and financing options narrowed. Less well-capitalized companies that are still short of self-funding and generating positive free cash flow, have a limited set of options to avoid running up debt and facing a restructuring. Besides selling, some are turning to private capital to provide alternative financing options.', '\u201cChallenges for one company can mean opportunity for someone else and we\u2019re seeing that on the private capital side,\u201d remarked Enverus Market Research Director, John Spears. \u201cDuring the exploratory and high growth years of shale, private equity was funding companies to drill and flip acreage. Today, private equity is providing a secondary source of capital to companies that need to grow but don\u2019t have the financial means via joint ventures, drillcos, purchasing overriding royalties, and other arrangements.\u201d', 'Tight capital raising options for potential sellers is one side of the equation for an M&A surge in 2020. However, for would-be buyers the outlook is more positive. After a year of cutting costs and focusing on efficiencies, larger companies look ready to turn the corner on free cash flow and are instituting dividends and share buybacks to reward investors. Their stock prices are also on the rise, aided by a combination of their own operational improvements and tailwinds from an improving global economic picture and rising oil prices.', 'As investors grow more confident in a company\u2019s ability to deliver on free cash flow, they also become more open to acquisitions, provided asset quality is high and the price is reasonable. In addition, larger E&Ps should be better positioned to deliver on returns to investors by leveraging economies of scale, more efficient development, and more favorable service and midstream contracts. Consolidation in the shale patch can either take the form of acquisitions by multi-nationals or mergers among the smaller to midsize players like was seen in 2019.', '\u201cIn the last ten years, we watched U.S. shale upend global energy markets and transform the U.S. into a net energy exporter,\u201d concluded Dittmar. \u201cWe\u2019re now at an inflection point where shale matures from a growth industry to one that generates dividends and share buybacks for its investors. Completing that transition and setting the stage for the next ten years will likely require a round of consolidation and 2020 sets up the needed pieces for this to occur.\u201d', 'Top 10 Deals of the Last Decade', 'Source: Enverus']"

    "content": "['In its newly released International Energy Outlook 2019 (IEO2019) Reference case, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects that world energy consumption will grow by nearly 50% between 2018 and 2050. Most of this growth comes from countries that are not in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and this growth is focused in regions where strong economic growth is driving demand, particularly in Asia.', 'EIA\u2019s IEO2019 assesses long-term world energy markets for 16 regions of the world, divided according to OECD and non-OECD membership. Projections for the United States in IEO2019 are consistent with those released in the Annual Energy Outlook 2019.', 'The industrial sector, which includes refining, mining, manufacturing, agriculture, and construction, accounts for the largest share of energy consumption of any end-use sector\u2014more than half of end-use energy consumption throughout the projection period. World industrial sector energy use increases by more than 30% between 2018 and 2050 as consumption of goods increases. By 2050, global industrial energy consumption reaches about 315 quadrillion British thermal units (Btu).', 'Transportation energy consumption increases by nearly 40% between 2018 and 2050. This increase is largely driven by non-OECD countries, where transportation energy consumption increases nearly 80% between 2018 and 2050. Energy consumption for both personal travel and freight movement grows in these countries much more rapidly than in many OECD countries.', 'Energy consumed in the buildings sector, which includes residential and commercial structures, increases by 65% between 2018 and 2050, from 91 quadrillion to 139 quadrillion Btu. Rising income, urbanization, and increased access to electricity lead to rising demand for energy.', 'The growth in end-use consumption results in electricity generation increasing 79% between 2018 and 2050. Electricity use grows in the residential sector as rising population and standards of living in non-OECD countries increase the demand for appliances and personal equipment. Electricity use also increases in the transportation sector as plug-in electric vehicles enter the fleet and electricity use for rail expands.', 'With the rapid growth of electricity generation, renewables\u2014including solar, wind, and hydroelectric power\u2014are the fastest-growing energy source between 2018 and 2050, surpassing petroleum and other liquids to become the most used energy source in the Reference case. Worldwide renewable energy consumption increases by 3.1% per year between 2018 and 2050, compared with 0.6% annual growth in petroleum and other liquids, 0.4% growth in coal, and 1.1% annual growth in natural gas consumption.', 'Global natural gas consumption increases more than 40% between 2018 and 2050, and total consumption reaches nearly 200 quadrillion Btu by 2050. In addition to the natural gas used in electricity generation, natural gas consumption increases in the industrial sector. Chemical and primary metals manufacturing, as well as oil and natural gas extraction, account for most of the growing industrial demand.', 'Global liquid fuels consumption increases more than 20% between 2018 and 2050, and total consumption reaches more than 240 quadrillion Btu in 2050. Demand in OECD countries remains relatively stable during the projection period, but non-OECD demand increases by about 45%.', '\\nSource: EIA']"

assault on the U.S. embassy in the Iraqi capital.', 'The aggressive response implies the United States still believes it has \u201cescalation dominance\u201d and Iran will absorb the blow rather than trying to match it or risk escalating the conflict further.', 'Officially, the United States remains committed to a policy of coercive diplomacy, steadily increasing economic pressure through sanctions to persuade Iran to resume negotiations on nuclear and regional security issues.', 'But Iran has refused to negotiate under sanctions and tensions between the two countries have been steadily increasing (\u201cIran promises to avenge U.S. killing of top commander Soleimani\u201d, Reuters, Jan. 3)', 'The lack of movement on the diplomatic front has caused the focus to switch to military operations as both sides try to increase their leverage and force a resumption of negotiations on their own terms.', 'Qassem Soleimani\u2019s killing is the latest incident in the \u201cshadow war\u201d between Iran and its regional proxies on the one hand, and the United States and its allies, including Israel, Saudi Arabia and Britain, on the other.', 'The undeclared conflict has included attacks on tankers, industrial sabotage, cyber warfare, assassinations and hostage taking, as well as on U.S. bases in Iraq and oil installations in Saudi Arabia.', 'OIL MARKET IMPACT',

heel\u201d, Reuters, Sept. 16, 2019).', 'In 2018, big reductions in the volume of Iran\u2019s exports as a result of U.S. sanctions were offset by increased output from Saudi Arabia and U.S. shale producers, ensuring oil supplies remained plentiful and prices fell.', 'In 2019, attacks on tanker shipping in the Strait of Hormuz and on oil installations in Saudi Arabia had only a transient effect on prices because of plentiful shale production and slack global oil consumption growth.', 'The increase in oil prices following Soleimani\u2019s killing, with front-month Brent futures up by around $2.50 per barrel (4%), suggests oil traders think the pattern will be repeated.', 'The small rise in Brent indicates traders are so far pricing in a low but non-zero probability of significant uncontrolled escalation across the region disrupting oil supplies.', 'ESCALATION CONTROL', '\\nBoth countries insist they are prepared for a full-scale armed conflict, while saying they do not seek it or think it likely.', 'Both have pursued a mixed strategy of escalation (increased sanctions, attacks on oil infrastructure) and containment.', 'And both have signalled at various times that they want to avoid provoking a full-scale and uncontrolled confrontation.', 'The United States has pursued a policy of strategic patience to give sanctions time to work, rather than resort to heavy armed force, in the belief a weakening economy will eventually force Iran to negotiate on more favourable terms.', 'The U.S. government believes time is on its side so there is no rush to bring the economic and military conflict to a crisis, which could also weaken support for its sanctions policy among its European and Middle East allies.', 'In turn, Iran has pursued its own version of forward defence, trying to push the conflict away from its own territory into neighbouring states, and raise the cost of sanctions on the United States and its allies.', 'MISCALCULATION RISK', '\\nSoleimani\u2019s killing represents a serious escalation of the conflict because he was identified as the architect of Iran\u2019s forward defence policy.', 'It remains unclear why the United States selected such a high-value target at this particular point, especially since it will likely provoke reprisals and impose some costs on U.S. intelligence collection efforts.', 'Iran will likely review its operational security and conduct a counter-intelligence sweep to identify the source of information that enabled the United States to locate its commander in real time.', 'The killing is likely to impose real costs but presumably the White House and senior decision-makers decided they were worth it to send a strong deterrence signal to Iran and reassure regional allies about U.S. resolve.', 'It remains unclear whether Soleimani\u2019s killing will mark a shift in the strategic calculations of either party (\u201cStrait of Hormuz and the risk of uncontrolled escalation\u201d, Reuters, June 13, 2019).', 'But the biggest risk has always been that a miscalculation by one or both sides, or their allies, could lead to spiralling conflict, possibly spreading to multiple sub-theatres across the Middle East.', 'Coercive diplomacy requires exquisite calibration of the degree of pressure to ensure controlled escalation does not spiral into uncontrolled escalation.', 'Previous escalations, including attacks on shipping in the Strait of Hormuz, oil installations in Saudi Arabia and the downing of a U.S. military drone, have all been followed by a successful effort to reduce tensions.', 'Contained conflict probably reflects the strategic preferences for both countries, but the more incidents, and the more serious they become, the greater the risk that one will provoke an uncontrolled escalation.', '\\nSource: Reuters (Editing by David Evans)']"

    "content": "['Hess Corp. rose above the carnage in shale stocks with a more traditional approach to oil exploration \u2014 partnering in a massive offshore discovery in a frontier nation.', 'Investors flocked to New York-based Hess in 2019 to participate in Exxon Mobil Corp.\u2019s gigantic Guyana oil find, and avoid cash-burning shale specialists. Hess, which holds a 30% stake in the Guyanese discovery that\u2019s turned into the world\u2019s biggest new deepwater oil prospect, climbed 65% last year, leading gains in the S&P 500 Energy Index. That was its biggest annual increase since 2007.', '\u201cMost of the outperformance is attributable to the company\u2019s continued success offshore Guyana,\u201d Muhammed Ghulam, a Houston-based analyst at Raymond James & Associates, said by email. The rally in Hess shares is poised to carry on \u201cif it continues to see success\u201d from drilling in Guyana and neighboring Suriname.', 'Hess outperformed every other stock in the S&P 500 Energy Index of 28 companies last year. That was in stark contrast to index peers such as Occidental Petroleum Corp., which posted it steepest decline in two decades after the ill-received acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum Corp., and Cabot Oil & Gas Corp., which tumbled more than 20%.', 'For Hess, it was a remarkable turnaround from 2018 when the company led by Chief Executive Officer John Hess was targeted by activist investor Elliott Management Corp. for pursuing high-cost shale projects in the Bakken region of North Dakota.', '\u201cHess has been on fire,\u201d Paul Sankey, a New York-based analyst at Mizuho Securities USA, said in a note to clients. While much of the success in Guyana already is reflected in Hess\u2019 stock price, the company could see further uplift when cash from the development begins to flow in, he said.', 'Bet of the Century', 'The genesis for Hess\u2019 success was in 2014, when crashing oil prices spurred Royal Dutch Shell Plc to pull out of its 50-50 partnership with Exxon in Guyana. That left the American supermajor in need of a new partner in its high-risk, wildcat drilling campaign in a region that had never before produced any oil.', 'Hess stepped in, as did China\u2019s CNOOC Ltd., which bought a 25% stake.', 'It turned out to be one of the best bets of the century, with Exxon uncovering an oil deposit so massive that its boundaries have yet to be discerned. Exxon Senior Vice President Neil Chapman characterized the discovery as a \u201cfairly tale\u201d during a 2018 conference call.', 'In subsequent years, Exxon and its partners have made 14 more finds totaling more than 6 billion barrels. Commercial production began in late December even as exploratory drilling continues.', '\u201cAt this point, we think production from Guyana developments over the next five or so years are in expectations,\u201d Sankey said. \u201cWe would need to see more connection of Guyana operational success back to cash return growth to drive re-rating higher.\u201d', '\\nSource: Bloomberg']"

So what will shape markets over the next 12 months?', 'Opec+', '\\nThe groupled by Saudi Arabia and Russia will begin implementing deeper cuts of 2.1 million barrels per day until the end of the first quarter, higher than the 1.2 million bpd withheld from the market last year. The alliance, which was forged in Algiers in 2016, has been limiting production since January 2017 with a view to providing some level of stability in oil markets following the price crash between 2014-16. It continues to grapple with the reality of the US being the most dominant player in the global oil industry, though. Its collective action this year could bolster prices but it remains to be seen for how long the group can sustain the deeper cuts, which have only reluctantly been agreed to by some members.', 'US-China trade war', '\\nThe trade tensions between the US and China weighed on oil for much of 2019, keeping Brent crude resilient to geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and restricting pricing to a tight band between $55 and $60. Uncertainty over the resolution of the trade war has been one of the biggest drivers of oil markets. Consensus over a phase one trade deal has appeased markets, prompting a rally towards the end of 2019, with the freeze of tariffs boosting sentiment for the global economy, which has been plagued by recessionary fears. The two sides are set to sign the phase one deal on January 15. However, there is still work to do. US President Donald Trump has vowed to start work on the phase two deal, which includes stickier points such as restrictions on China\u2019s subsidies to state-owned firms. How this plays out next year ahead of Mr Trump\u2019s re-election campaign will also be a deciding factor for the oil markets.', 'US Elections', '\\nThe United States will decide on its new president this year, with Mr Trump campaigning to be re-elected. He has become one of the most important factors impacting oil prices, with his pronouncements via Twitter on Opec or the trade war causing prices to rally or slump. Mr Trump was influential in coaxing Opec+ to reverse production cuts in 2018 in order to moderate prices to appease voters ahead of the midterm elections.', 'Should Mr Trump win re-election, there would be a \u201ccontinuation\u201d of US energy policy albeit \u201cmore intense\u201d, said Randolph Bell, director of the Atlantic Council\u2019s Global Energy Centre.', '\u201cSo that\u2019s a deregulatory agenda in the United States and a lack of action on climate change,\u201d he said. This would, however, prompt more of a leadership role on the climate change front from US tech companies, he added. Left-leaning Democratic candidates such as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, on the other hand, have been campaigning for stricter action on climate change and have also proposed a ban on fracking, which could hurt the US energy industry and challenge its dominance as the world\u2019s top producer. Yet such a scenario seems unlikely, Mr Bell suggested. \u201c[A] ban on fracking would require the support of the US congress. That\u2019s really off the table and these promises are for campaign purposes than for real,\u201d he said.', '\\nSource: The National ']"

Yet the revolution did not translate to higher stock prices. The S&P 500 Energy sector only gained 6% for the decade, far less than the 180% return for the broader stock market.', 'The decade-long oil expansion failed to boost profits, which has discouraged investors. The shale industry was squeezed by an OPEC price war that began in 2014, sending U.S. crude prices below $30 per barrel at one point.', 'Production temporarily slowed, but accelerated into the end of the decade as companies cut costs and grew more efficient. Now, with investor returns flagging, the industry no longer believes in drilling its way to success even at higher prices.', '\u201cThe drumbeat has been loud and uniform from investors,\u201d said Parsley Energy Chief Executive Officer Matt Gallagher.

Here are five.', 'A trigger point for climate change', '\\nNew EU legislation could be the catalyst. The EU leads the world in aspiration and policy, and a new regime is cranking up the pace. The \u2018green deal\u2019, legislation planned for Q1 2020, envisages a binding commitment to net-carbon neutrality by 2050. Another EU initiative that could galvanise global acceptance of carbon taxes are border tariffs. These aim to protect EU-produced goods from cheaper imports with a heavy carbon footprint. The timing for new legislation sets up COP26, the UN climate conference, in Glasgow in December 2020 as a possible turning point for climate change. Global emissions have risen since the Paris Agreement five years ago. COP26 must commit the 196 Paris signatories to the tougher emissions reductions now needed to get the world on track for a 2 \u00b0C pathway.', 'US election and geopolitics', '\\nThe November presidential election could have big implications for energy markets. Domestically, the US oil and gas industry fears a backlash after the halcyon days of this Trump term. A Democratic victory would change the agenda, the question is how far \u2013 to Obama-plus under Joe Biden or that of a hard-core environmentalist? The Warren proposal to ban fracking hints at the latter, though it\u2019s doubtful Washington has the requisite power to cut the legs off shale gas and oil development. Globally, a change in administration would be impactful. There\u2019s the possibility of re-signing the Paris Agreement; the US-China trade dispute; and US foreign policy which, emboldened by tight oil growth, has reached far and wide under this administration. For starters, what would the Democrats do about sanctions on Iran and Venezuela that are keeping 2 million b/d of crude exports off the market? A second Trump term will mean more of the same from these last four years.', 'The global economy and oil demand', '\\nNo recession, but global GDP growth slid from 2.9% in 2018 to 2.3% in 2019 with the US-China trade dispute weighing on industrial production. Oil demand disappointed, growing at half the rate forecast at the start of the year. In 2020, we expect a bounce in oil demand growth despite tepid GDP growth of 2.4%. We forecast 1.35 million b/d, more than double the 0.6 million b/d of 2019 (the lowest since 2011). One-offs depressed 2019 whereas 2020 demand will be boosted by marine diesel in China and NGLs for new US petrochemical capacity. Any repeat of demand disappointment will add to the pressure OPEC+ is under to balance a fundamentally oversupplied market.', 'Sector credibility', '\\nThe industry has done a dismal job in convincing equity markets and the wider public of its role as the energy transition plays out. The global economy needs oil and gas for some decades yet. It\u2019s up to oil and gas companies in 2020 to present themselves in a better light \u2013 as part of the solution rather than the problem. What\u2019s needed? A plan to maximise cash value for shareholders from the core oil and gas value chain. A plan to measure, reduce and eliminate Scope 1, 2 and even Scope 3 emissions. A plan to adapt to an energy market that\u2019s decarbonising. That will be a start. Repsol, aiming for net-carbon neutrality by 2050, has set a bold example. Other IOCs \u2013 and NOCs \u2013 need to follow.', 'Gas \u2013 financing a key transition fuel', '\\nGas, with its low-carbon intensity on burning compared to other fossil fuels, has a critical role to play in balancing the intermittency of solar and wind power through the transition. Global gas demand looks resilient for the next two decades and beyond, and the industry is onto it \u2013 planned LNG projects are at record highs. But policy makers and capital markets are moving fast \u2013 will finance be available for the huge investment needed? The European Investment Bank is the latest to withdraw from the sector, and will cease funding coal, oil or gas projects after 2021. The industry needs to work harder in 2020 to demonstrate the benefits of gas and its environmental credentials \u2013 in tandem with carbon capture and storage \u2013 to ensure that finance for much-needed gas projects doesn\u2019t dry up.', '\\nSource: Wood Mackenzie']"

A greater appetite for lighter and sweeter crudes at one end and a loss of demand for dirty fuels at the other will have far-reaching implications across Europe and beyond.', 'Northwest Europe is expected to be balanced to long for 0.5% sulfur fuel oil in 2020, according to market sources, following the completion of several refinery upgrades, and increasing imports of sweet crude barrels which produce lower sulfur fuels.', 'Prior to the lower sulfur cap regulation, Northwest Europe was net long 3.5% sulfur fuel oil, sending supply east to Singapore as well as down to Mediterranean ports. However, as forecast by Platts Analytics, declining demand for 3.5% fuel oil is set to see a collapse in the east-west arbitrage.', 'The East-West spread \u2014 which measures 380 CST Singapore fuel oil cargoes against 3.5% suflur FOB Rotterdam barges, indicating the openness of the arbitrage east \u2014 has widened towards the end of 2019. The average spread across Q3 2019 was $47.65/mt, considerably higher than the figure for Q3 2018 at $15.19/mt. Despite stronger values, Platts has not seen an increase in the number of vessels heading eastwards. As the deadline approaches, with volatile prices and dropping demand for higher sulfur fuel oil, traders became increasingly less likely to try and work the arbitrage for fear of being stranded withproduct and no buyer.', 'Whether the arbitrage between Singapore and Rotterdam will continue for 0.5% in the same way it traditionally did for 3.5% remains unclear.', 'Meanwhile, the Mediterranean, known for its complex refining capacity, is expected to reverse its position from being net-short HSFO, to net-long for 0.5% marine fuel, as companies look to use low sulfurstraight run fuels in their bunker pool.', 'Demand for light sweet crude grades across Europe has risen as refineries adjusted their slates for lower sulfur oil production ahead of the regulation, with sources noting that demand for Algeria\u2019s premier grade has particularly benefited as it is an ideal grade to blend with heavier and sourer barrels.', 'Algerian low-sulfur straight-run fuel oil \u2014 always highly prized for its quality \u2014 is drawing attention from refiners globally. European and Singapore-based players have been paying high values to import LSSR from Skikda, Algeria, when typically about 80%-90% of those cargoes would have headed to the US, one source said.', 'Approximately 400,000 mt of LSSR per month is exported from the 335,000 b/d refinery complex at Skikda, with the US traditionally having been a key buyer, particularly during the summer months to producegasoline.', 'Thus, a tug of war has emerged between several countries willing to pay higher values for Algerian barrels.', '\\nWEST AFRICAN QUALITY', 'West African grades have also received increased interest.

Traders have told Platts they believe the European market is more likely to fill local shorts rather than export product. One market participant told Platts that the time and costs incurred in building a 0.5% sulfur cargo for arbitraging east were not viable as traders will struggle to find buyers who will meet the price.', '\\nRUSSIAN UPGRADES SLOW', 'Russia\u2019s fuel oil output dropped significantly in the last few years, down from about 80 million mt a few years ago to about 50 million mt in 2018. This figure will likely remain stable in the next few years until all refinery modernization programs are completed. Some refineries, like Lukoil\u2019s Volgograd, switched to 0.5% fuel oil, whereas Perm fully halted fuel oil output, but upgrades are progressing more slowly at others. Lukoil\u2019s Nizhny Novgorod and Gazprom Neft\u2019s Omsk target completion and subsequent fall of fuel oil output around 2021, but for Gazprom Neft\u2019s Moscow refinery the timeline is 2024 while Rosneft, which operates the majority of Russia\u2019s biggest refineries, plans to complete its refinery modernization program by 2025.', 'The 13 million mt/year bunker market is expected to contract next year, which potentially will add to the export flows. With fuel oil exports accounting for almost 90% of output, Russia is looking at ways to ease the pressure by increasing bitumen output and deferring the sulfur cap on bunker fuel used on its internal waterways.', 'But a new excise planned by the Russian government from April 2020 is likely to put even more pressure on refineries as the tax will likely push domestic fuel oil prices up and hit local demand.

    "content": "['No matter which data aggregator you have come to rely on, most currently point to the U.S. having spent key months in the 2019 trading cycle exporting more oil than it imported. Its something that has not been seen since the 1940s.', 'High mark of the past 12 months was September, a month in which U.S. exports of crude oil and refined products exceeded imports by 89,000 barrels per day (bpd), according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), compared to the previous September.', 'Much of this was driven by the light sweet crude proceeds of the shale revolution. To put things into perspective, the EIA\u2019s archival data points to American imports exceeding exports by 12 million bpd less than a decade ago, albeit at time when there was a ban on U.S. exports of crude oil. This was subsequently lifted by President Barack Obama in December 2015.', 'Remarkably even in 2015, in the wake of the lifting of the 40-year ban by Obama, few thought the situation would alter dramatically. Yet a mere four years later, U.S. imports, especially of light crude from OPEC producers and elsewhere have continued to slide.', 'For instance, U.S. imports of Nigeria\u2019s Bonny Light, are down by 90% using some metrics, and slid to net zero in July. Not only that, U.S. exports of crude, again comprising of primarily light sweet crude, have at times averaged well above 3 million bpd.', 'Noting such trends, the International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts the U.S. to become a sustained net oil exporter in either late 2020 or early 2021. The think-tank\u2019s projections point to an increase in U.S. exports of crude and refined products from 550,000 bpd in October 2019 to average 750,000 bpd in 2020.', 'Market doubts persist over whether the shale industry momentum can be sustained stateside, including issues related to servicing debt and attracting fresh investment. But price supportive action by OPEC and incremental interest from oil majors in viable shale plays suggests it is not all doom and gloom that some market commentators are predicting.', 'And it is worth pointing out the U.S. still imports large volumes of crude oil, especially heavy sour crude, given its refining complex, from exporters such as Brazil, Canada and Saudi Arabia to name a few. Nonetheless, the tectonic plates of the U.S. petroleum trade are shifting.', 'In 2018, the country\u2019s petroleum trade deficit stood at $62 billion, or 10% of Washington\u2019s trade balance, according to Rystad Energy. The Norway-based research and consulting outfit believes not only will a deficit this large be wiped out in 2020, but that a surplus could be achieved as early as February or March, and Washington could become \u201cenergy independent on a monthly basis\u201d going forward.', 'If proven by the industry and survey data, that would be a remarkable reversal for a country which is currently the world\u2019s largest crude consumer, and one that has been in a petroleum trade deficit since 1949.', '\\nSource: Forbes']"

In other words, sooner or later, the falling oil prices translate into lower pump prices.', 'Still, as the crude market slumps expect gas prices to dip and U.S. consumers to spend the cash they\u2019ve saved at the pump, thus helping boost the economy.', 'That should help lift prices of consumer discretionary stocks such as those held by the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY) exchange-traded fund. These companies, which include General Motors and Amazon.com, typically sell things that people want but don\u2019t always have to buy, such as a new car.', 'On the other hand, energy stocks, such as those held in the Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) ETF, might not do so well because of the subdued crude prices.', 'Then there is Saudi Arabia and the other the oil-producing countries in the region. Lower oil prices mean lower government revenues. Unfortunately, unlike in the U.S. or European Union, there are few other sources of revenue to offset the decline.', 'In the case of Saudi Arabia, any oil price below $77 means that the government is spending more than it is raking in. While Saudi has a large stash of cash in its coffers, other countries have less and may feel the strain in their economies more.', 'In other words, investors should expect growth in the region to get hampered by falling energy prices next year.', '\\nSource: Forbes']"

After dipping during spring refinery maintenance season, rail exports out of Western Canada are expected to average nearly 400,000 b/d during the second half of 2020.', 'While increased rail flows may support differentials in Alberta by draining tanks, they may push heavy crude prices lower on the US Gulf Coast, traders said.', '\u201cAs more barrels land, the differential could widen out,\u201d one Calgary-based trader said.', 'Platts last assessed WCS at Nederland, Texas, at WTI CMA minus $4.15/b, down $2.25/b from where it began the year.', 'Platts Analytics sees the Western Canadian oil supply growing by 265,000 b/d in 2020 year on year as a result of the rail deal and increased pipeline capacity.

Nearly all of the forecast decrease is due to fewer emissions from coal consumption. Forecast natural gas CO2 emissions increase and petroleum CO2 emissions remain virtually unchanged.', 'Based on data in EIA\u2019s Monthly Energy Review, energy-related CO2 emissions in the first three months of 2019 were largely similar to those in the first three months of 2018. In the first quarter of 2019, EIA estimates that U.S. energy-related emissions totaled 1,367 million metric tons (MMmt), which is nearly equal to those in the first quarter of 2018.', 'The first quarter of the year is typically the period with the highest CO2 emissions in the United States, and therefore, heavily influences the overall annual trend. In the past 30 years, only 6 years have had an overall annual emissions trend that was different than that of the year\u2019s first quarter. If EIA\u2019s emissions forecast is realized, 2019 will be the seventh such year, with overall emissions decreasing from 2018 values despite a first-quarter increase.', 'For the remainder of the year, EIA expects that relatively mild forecast temperatures will keep energy demand and resulting energy-related CO2 emissions below last year\u2019s levels.

Conversely, EIA projects CO2 emissions from natural gas to increase by 53 MMmt. Both changes are largely due to forecast changes in the electricity generation mix as natural gas continues to grow as the most prevalent electricity generation fuel.', 'Because the electric power sector consumes nearly 92% of the coal used in the United States, expectations for both overall lower electricity demand and a lower share of coal-fired electricity this summer lead EIA to forecast lower coal CO2 emissions.', 'Although the electric power sector is using more natural gas, EIA does not expect the increase in natural gas emissions in 2019 to offset the decrease in coal emissions because natural gas-fired electricity generation is less carbon-intensive than coal-fired electricity generation.', 'EIA expects that CO2 emissions from petroleum consumption, which has risen in each of the past six years, will be virtually flat in 2019.

The new guidelines, dubbed IMO 2020, will limit the sulphur content of \u201cbunker\u201d fuel on ships to just 0.5 per cent, down from the current 3.5 per cent.', 'The deadline has been in place for years, but the change is still expected to wallop prices for heavy oil containing high levels of sulphur, such as raw bitumen from the Alberta oilsands. Bitumen makes up about half of Canada\u2019s 4.6 million barrels per day of crude oil production.', 'The discount on Western Canadian Select bitumen blend crude prices versus North American benchmark West Texas Intermediate could almost double in January, said Alan Gelder, vice-president, refining, for consultancy Wood Mackenzie.', '\u201cIn October, we\u2019ve got the WTI-WCS differential at about US$16 per barrel.

When the differential widened to as much as US$52 a barrel at the end of 2018, a development blamed on pipeline capacity failing to keep up with oilsands growth, the Alberta government introduced production curtailments in a successful bid to narrow the spread. The production limits have since been reduced but not cancelled.', 'Analyst Phil Skolnick of Eight Capital says there was little evidence of a major jump in WCS differentials pricing for January crude oil trades that started in early December.', 'The impact of the new pollution rules is being softened by disruptions in the flow of competing heavy oil from Venezuela and Mexico into the U.S., as well as new petrochemical projects in Asia that need heavy oil as feedstock, he said.', '\u201cCanada is benefiting because of Venezuela, Mexico. With that, combined with the pull from these new petrochemical plants that are consuming medium and heavy oil, it\u2019s helping to offset the risks of IMO 2020,\u201d said Skolnick.', 'Companies that own refineries or oilsands upgraders are expected to benefit as the new standards will increase demand for refined low-sulphur fuels.', 'At its recent investor day, chief financial officer Dan Lyons of Calgary-based Imperial Oil Ltd. said it will offer four options for marine fuel customers at its Vancouver terminal \u2014 3.5 per cent sulphur, 0.5 per cent, 0.1 per cent and blends made to order.', 'An expansion at its Lloydminster Upgrader on the Alberta-Saskatchewan border will help Calgary-based Husky Energy Inc. benefit from IMO 2020 as its diesel output will jump to 10,000 bpd from 6,000 bpd, said spokeswoman Kim Guttormson.', 'The company also produces diesel at its Lima Refinery in Ohio, which has been reconfigured to use more heavy oil.', 'Saint John-based Irving Oil Ltd. produces VLSFO (very low sulphur fuel oil) and marine gas oil at its Whitegate refinery in Ireland and is offering IMO-compliant fuels in New Brunswick through its expanded bunker operations, said spokeswoman Candice MacLean in an email. It also offers marine fuel oil in St. John\u2019s, N.L., and Halifax, she added.', 'Most of the five million barrels per day of bunker fuel currently burned on ships is derived from the crude residue that remains after more valuable fuels such as gasoline and diesel have been removed in a refinery.', 'Following combustion, the sulphur in the fuel becomes sulphur oxide, a pollutant that causes respiratory problems and lung disease as well as acid rain. IMO 2020 is expected to prevent 8.5 million tonnes per year of sulphur oxide from entering the atmosphere.', 'The IMO first began restricting emissions in 2005 and its limits on sulphur in bunker fuel have been progressively tightened. Four \u201cemission control areas\u201d in Europe and North America already have a 0.1 per cent limit.', 'About 3.5 million bpd of bunker fuels consumed in 2019 are considered high-sulphur fuel oil. That is expected to fall to about 1.3 million bpd in January, according to Wood Mackenzie, as most ships will switch to alternatives including VLSFO and marine gas oil.', 'About 15 per cent of ships will have added \u201cscrubbers\u201d by then to capture sulphur from their smokestacks and allow them to continue to burn high-sulphur crude.', 'Full compliance is not expected on Jan. 1.

    "content": "['Growth in U.S. oil production may have started to slow, but the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is sorely mistaken if it thinks it will soon be out of the supply-cut game.', 'While U.S. shale has been overwhelmingly responsible for the rapid growth in non-OPEC supply over the past five years, other producers outside the cartel, mainly Brazil, Norway, Guyana and even Canada, are now poised to add substantial incremental barrels in 2020 and beyond. ', 'That means new volumes from rival non-OPEC producers could offset even a significant slowdown in U.S. oil production growth. And that may force OPEC and its partners, particularly Russia, to continue making painful supply cuts for the foreseeable future to keep prices from tanking. ', 'To be sure, U.S. producers will still lead the way in growing non-OPEC supply in 2020, despite slowing domestic investment and drilling activity. ', 'The Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates total U.S. oil production growth will slow to 1.1 million barrels a day in 2020. That\u2019s down from a whopping 1.6 million barrels a day in 2019 and nearly 2 million barrels a day in 2018. ', 'Peak shale growth has probably been reached, and those rates from past boom years are unlikely to be matched again. But that won\u2019t matter for OPEC if other non-OPEC suppliers make up the difference.', 'And that\u2019s precisely the scenario that is lining up in 2020. The IEA still sees non-OPEC supply rising by 2.1 million barrels a day in 2020 \u2014 far outpacing projected global demand growth of 1.2 million barrels a day. ', 'For too long, the world has focused exclusively on shale as the primary thorn in OPEC\u2019s side. But Brazil, Norway and Guyana are all gearing up to deliver massive new flows of offshore oil. Producing regions outside of the United States will provide at least half of non-OPEC supply growth in 2020, which spells big problems for Saudi Arabia and its cartel allies. ', 'Brazil\u2019s state-controlled Petrobras recently unveiled a five-year plan to spend $76 billion from 2020-2024 to grow output, mainly from its fertile geologic \u201cpre-salt\u201d formations, by nearly 30 percent to 3.5 million barrels of oil equivalent a day by 2024.', 'Meanwhile, international oil companies keep racking up new finds offshore Guyana, where 16 discoveries in recent years have driven estimates of recoverable resources to more than 6 billion barrels of oil equivalent. The success puts the South American country near the top of global rankings for conventional oil exploration, making it one of the hottest upstream plays in the world.', 'Guyana\u2019s entrance as a major producer is also imminent. Exxon Mobil counts Guyana as a significant source of future low-cost production and aims to ramp up production at the Stabroek field to 750,000 barrels a day by 2025.', 'Neither Brazil nor Guyana is a \u201cflash in the pan\u201d producer. Real money is being invested in bringing these massive offshore reserves \u2014 where breakeven costs are resilient and typically below $40 a barrel \u2014 to the market over the coming decade. ', 'Norway, on the other hand, is a mature producer, but in the near-term, the recent start-up of its enormous Johan Sverdrup field contributes to the non-OPEC supply glut. The 2.7 billion barrel field in the North Sea is expected to produce for 50 years, reaching its full capacity of 660,000 barrels a day around 2022.', 'Likewise, Canada is another mature producer that generates less investor excitement than Brazil, Guyana, or its shale producing neighbor to the south. But the gradual easing of Alberta\u2019s curtailment policy, which has raised local oil prices for Canadian producers sufficiently, means more barrels will spill onto the market in the near-term, as well.', 'None of this is good news for the OPEC cartel, stuck as it is in a neverending cycle of production cuts. ', 'Global benchmark Brent oil prices and U.S. crude may have recently rallied past $65 and $60, respectively, driven by optimism over OPEC\u2019s latest supply cut agreement and the Phase 1 U.S.-China trade deal. But oil markets still look oversupplied in 2020, and shale is no longer the lone culprit. It\u2019s hard to see a sustained rally in oil prices at the moment.', 'No producer benefits from low oil prices, including U.S. energy companies. But OPEC\u2019s actions in recent years suggest the cartel and its petro-state members need higher prices more than their non-OPEC brethren. And that points to further OPEC cuts when the current deal expires on March 31. Either that or a significant pullback in prices.', '\\nSource: Forbes']"

    "content": "['As the year comes to a close, it\u2019s a fitting time to review recent developments that inform our future expectations for the  global oil and gas industry.', 'The past decade once again reminded the world of the immense price volatility of fossil fuels. The boom and bust is driven by the investment cycle affecting supply, and demand caused by the economic growth.', 'The oil price boom of 2011-2014 was followed by a sobering crash of mid-2014-2017. Brent price halved within four months, going down from $115.00 per barrel in September 2014 to $27.67 January 2015.    ', 'The global demand for fuels has grown since then. Key industry players have learned from past experience and adopted better strategies to cope with the market volatility. Nonetheless, the oil and gas sector remains highly uncertain and sensitive to the global geopolitical trends, and security, from Abqaiq to Venezuela.', '2019 was an incredible testament to that. This September, when the ongoing Iranian-Saudi rivalry, including the internationalized civil war in Yemen, had resulted in an attack on the Saudi Aramco\u2019s critical oil production facilities, the world saw the greatest single disruption of global oil supply since the Gulf War of 1991. Nevertheless, the abundance of oil in the markets, less than stellar economic performance, and the sale of some oil futures contracts have prevented panic and allowed the markets to move on with a minimal disruption.', 'Today, the U.S.-led sanctions on Iran and the steady decrease in Venezuelan oil production have contributed to concerns over global energy security, while a global economic slow-down dampened the demand. The global oil supply remains solid, in a price band that favors economic growth.', 'Meanwhile, the market also recalibrated the regional outlook of the major fuels\u2019 suppliers. OECD countries increased their liquids supply by 1.54 million barrels per day from the 2018 average mostly thanks to the United States that recently became a net petroleum exporter.', 'With 90,000 bpd more total oil and liquid fuel products sold than purchased in September, the United States had become a net exporter for the first time since the records started running in 1949. The U.S. Energy and Information Administration predicts the net exports to continue exceeding net imports by an average of at least 80,000 bpd in 2020. The U.S. crude oil production will continue its impressive growth up to 13,2 million bpd, compared to 12,3 million bpd in 2019. ', 'Needless to say, the increase in the U.S. production of fossil fuels allowed it to shift the long-standing distribution of the energy market share in Europe. With Iran and, to an extent, Russia being discouraged from exporting hydrocarbons by sanctions, the United States has is aspiring to significantly expand its energy exports, both oil and gas. For European countries, this presents a great opportunity to mitigate their decades-long dependency on undesirable and unstable suppliers, thereby boosting energy security in the region.', 'U.S. liquified natural gas (LNG) has challenged Russia\u2019s dominance in Europe this year. While Moscow looks to launch the Nord Stream 2 in 2020, a pipeline that would double its gas export capacity to Germany to 110 billion cubic meters (bcm) per year, the increasing presence of the U.S. as an alternative supplier may make Russia uncomfortable, and put a downward pressure on prices to the benefit of European consumers. America is now the second largest LNG supplier to Europe after Qatar, and has seen shipments rise by 181% between July 2018 and March 2019.', 'Although U.S. natural gas production is expected to continue to rise, it will grow at a slower rate in the first six months of 2020 in response to lower prices in the third quarter of 2019, averaging 95.1 bcf per day. Notwithstanding the structural changes associated with the U.S. LNG boom, Henry Hub natural gas prices will most likely go down from $2.59 in 2019 to an average of $2.42-2.45 MMBtu in 2020.', 'The fact that at these low prices the gas production industry is still profitable and growing pays tribute to American technological prowess. With some of the stranded gas reaching US markets as pipelines being completed, may further dampen prices.', 'In regard to oil prices, two major recent developments will influence the market trends of 2020. First, the OPEC-plus members have agreed to lower their oil production by additional 500,000 bpd, rounding up to 1.7 million bpd cut from the baseline of October 2018. In view of increasing oil inventories, OPEC-plus is expected to extend the output cut beyond the upcoming March \u2013 most \u2014 probably till the end of 2020.', 'Second, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) is looking to enact a new bunker-fuel regulation starting January 1 that will require to use low-sulfur fuel oil for maritime shipping. This is done to diminish SOx and CO2 emissions, and will result in redirection of high-sulfur fuel oil into power generation and generate additional short-term demand for \u2018compliant\u2019 bunker-fuel.', 'In view of these factors, oil prices should rise, potentially scoring above $65 per barrel for Brent oil in the first half of the next year as the industry responds to the structural demand changes, and then go down to average $61 per barrel for 2020, compared to $64 for 2019. WTI price is expected to reach $55 per barrel.', 'While these forecasts are informed by the global economic and geopolitical situation at this point, there are other important factors that exacerbate the uncertainty and volatility of the fossil fuels markets. In the context of the generally slowing economic growth worldwide, such ongoing political and security factors as the U.S.-China trade tensions, the November 2020 U.S. presidential election, handling of Brexit by the newly elected Tory Cabinet, as well as regional conflicts among and within countries in the Middle East could still bear unanticipated consequences for the oil and gas industry.', '\\nSource: Forbes']"

Refiners are attributing this to a slowdown in fuel demand.', 'Under regulations issued in October 2016 by IMO, the marine sector must reduce sulphur emissions by 80% by switching to lower sulphur fuels. Sulphur content in marine fuels will have to be reduced to 0.5% from the present 3.5%. Higher sulphur content in fuel is a major contributor to air pollution.', 'There are essentially two ways to do this: one, to clean up fuel oil by installing scrubbers\u2014also known as marine exhaust equipment. But Indian refiners do not produce much fuel oil. The other alternative to high sulphur fuel oil is diesel, the Indian refiners\u2019 preferred option, and the reason they anticipated an increase in diesel demand.', 'High-speed diesel of the kind produced by Indian refiners have reduced level of sulphur as necessitated by the Bharat Stage emission standards. Hence, the new IMO rule was expected to boost the gross refining margins of refiners such as Reliance Industries, Nayara Energy, Indian Oil Corp. Ltd, Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd. But in the absence of a global recovery in oil demand, analysts anticipate that gross refining margins would remain suppressed for a few more months. Anticipating higher diesel demand post mandatory implementation of the new IMO norms on 1 January, refineries across the world added capacity. Demand, however, has not kept pace.', 'Higher demand was expected to improve diesel\u2019s \u2018crack spread\u2019\u2014the difference between the price of crude oil and petroleum products extracted from it\u2014to as high as $20-30 a barrel by FY21.', 'Consumption of diesel as a marine fuel is expected to increase from 0.75mnbpd (million barrels per day) to 3.3mnbpd in 2020. This would result in additional demand of 2.6mnbpd of diesel. Since refineries may not be able to meet this incremental demand due to limited refining capacity, it may lead to a spike in diesel margins racks, ultimately improving overall refining margins.', '\u201cSince we don\u2019t make fuel oil, we are in an advantageous position. We get the benefit of IMO if the gasoil (petrol) prices go up; then you expect better economics which everyone expected for gasoil cracks to be substantially higher,\u201d said B.

But complications in short-term contracting as a result of market volatility and trade uncertainty can deter buyers from entering supply agreements with US projects, favoring projects that are backed by majors and capitalized.', 'GLOBAL TRENDS', '\\nGlobally, a series of major LNG projects took a different approach in recent years that saw deep-pocketed project sponsors take FID without firm offtake agreements. That has given projects in Canada, Russia and elsewhere a speed-to-market advantage The only US project to take that route, so far, has been Golden Pass LNG in Texas, which is backed by ExxonMobil and Qatar Petroleum.', 'Amid the contracting challenges in the US, some established players are moving forward with additional liquefaction trains with less offtake sold upfront than for earlier trains.

It is the time of year for taking stock and looking to the future, and in that spirit, I have collected a selection of predictions for 2020 from 10 WoodMac experts.', 'A slowdown in US Lower 48 oil production growth will help OPEC', '\\nWe are forecasting persistent global oversupply to continue in 2020, with non-OPEC production to increase 2.3 million barrels per day (b/d) year-on-year. For the first time in four years, though, the US will contribute less than half of that non-OPEC gain, as new producers such as Guyana ramp up and US shale growth slows.', 'Wood Mackenzie forecasts total US liquids production to rise by 1 million b/d in 2020, less than half the increase in 2018, when output rose by an astounding 2.4 million b/d. As the industry moves beyond the sweetest spots for drilling, and investors choke back the flow of capital to E&Ps, US Lower 48 onshore crude and condensate production is expected to gain just 0.5 million b/d in 2020. Having put pressure on other oil-producing countries for years, US investors will indirectly help them in 2020, supporting the OPEC+ group\u2019s attempt to tackle global oversupply by restraining its output. With OPEC+ production restraint and stable demand growth, additional downward pressure on crude prices can be avoided in 2020.', 'Ann-Louise Hittle, Head of Macro Oils', 'Investors will reward US E&Ps who sharpen their focus on dividends and debt reduction', '\\nThe immense pressure tight oil players are under to generate free cash will not go away in 2020, and could well persist into 2021 and 2022. Dropping rigs is one of the fastest ways to generate cash, but since the commodity downturn of 2009, very few shale E&Ps have pursued a successful \u201cshrink to grow\u201d strategy. Now may be the time to revisit that. Some Marcellus producers have tested the waters before releasing firm 2020 budgets, and their messages have been well received. If tight oil E&Ps are brave enough to tell investors they\u2019ll forfeit any production growth to concentrate on delivering cash flow and raising dividends instead, we believe this market is likely to reward them.', 'Robert Clarke, Research Director Lower 48 Upstream', 'Company share prices will begin to reflect differences in perceived climate risk', '\\nPressure on companies to disclose climate-related risks, including emissions metrics and the potential impacts to their businesses under a 2\u00b0C scenario, will increase. In 2020 they will release the first round of annual results since the EU\u2019s guidelines on reporting climate-related information were published in July 2019, and the EU Regulation on Disclosures relating to sustainable investments and sustainability risks came into force. That EU regulation makes it mandatory for financial market participants to disclose how they incorporate sustainability risks into their investment decisions and products, and how they measure alignment with sustainability targets. To provide those disclosures, financial market participants will require greater disclosure around sustainability risks, including climate risk, from companies in their portfolios. In the US, companies will also face increased scrutiny as the issue rises up the political agenda, as a result of the presidential election and debates over the proposed Climate Risk Disclosure Act, introduced in the Senate by Elizabeth Warren.', 'Amy Bowe, Director of Upstream Consulting', 'Sustainability will permeate all business segments', '\\nBuilding resilience in the face of energy transition across all business segments will be one of 2020\u2019s key themes. Shifting portfolios to the lower end of the cost curve, capital discipline and shareholder returns will remain high on the list of strategic priorities. Value will be favoured over volume. Digitalisation and technology will dominate the resource renewal discussion, making explorers even more uncomfortable. Eyes will be on Repsol, as it reveals what it means to align its exploration portfolio with the Paris climate goals. The EU\u2019s Green Deal will prompt a few strategic reviews across the sector, with BP the one to watch.', 'Valentina Kretzschmar, Director of Corporate Research', 'International oil companies will keep selling assets', '\\nThe process of re-engineering upstream portfolios for resilience will continue in 2020. Portfolio rationalisation will be a key tool, fuelled by a supermajor sell-off. But don\u2019t expect a big rebound in upstream M&A from 2019\u2019s lows. The supply of assets will outstrip demand. Sellers will need to accept discounted prices to shift low-margin, carbon-intensive assets from their portfolios.', 'Tom Ellacott, Senior Vice-President, Corporate Research', 'Solar power will continue to prosper in major markets in spite of subsidy cuts, while new markets will emerge', '\\n2020 will mark the beginning of reduced investment tax credits in the US, while China, the world\u2019s largest solar market, moves toward a subsidy-free solar market structure. It will be the first time in a long time that the number one and two solar markets will have embarked on major policy shifts. Even so, we expect we expect 126 gigawatts (GW) of capacity to be installed in 2020, beating the current record of 105 GW achieved in 2019. India, the third-largest market, will continue to see more low-priced utility-scale projects come online, even as the longer-term view remains tepid due to excessively competitive solar tenders. The long tail of solar markets will also grow at a faster clip, with 22 country markets having at least 500 megawatts of annual installations, up from 17 in 2019 and 16 the year before. For the longer-term, there could be several bright spots, including the new solar homes mandate in California that goes into effect on January 1, and the initiation of China\u2019s 14th Five-Year Plan.', 'Ravi Manghani, Head of Solar', 'All eyes will be on China as uncertainties mount', '\\nIt\u2019s difficult to recall heading into a new year with quite so much uncertainty over China\u2019s economy. With stimulus options much more restricted than in the past, the country\u2019s economic planners have just called for a \u201ccontingency plan\u201d to deal with slowing growth. Last week\u2019s phase one trade agreement with the US may have garnered headlines, but delivered very little of substance. All of this matters. China is the biggest market for seaborne commodities, and economic uncertainty coupled with Beijing\u2019s double down on raising domestic coal, oil and gas output in 2020 will have major implications for commodity price volatility over the coming 12 months.', 'Gavin Thompson, Vice-Chair Asia-Pacific', 'Commodity prices will converge in Asia', '\\nEnergy transition drives inter-fuel substitution. Japan\u2019s gas-fired capacity is under-utilised because gas prices have traditionally been higher than coal, so coal-to-gas switching didn\u2019t generally make sense. But things are changing. Japanese utilities are looking to curb emissions and keen to increase gas plant utilisation to help them integrate renewable power supplies and reduce local air pollution. Meanwhile, liquefied natural gas (LNG) suppliers are looking to secure demand with innovative pricing models in an oversupplied market. In April 2019, Tokyo Gas announced a 10-year agreement with Shell Eastern Trading for supply of 0.5 million tonnes per annum of LNG from 2020. The contract price is said to include coal indexation. We understand this is the first such LNG contract for supply to Japan. The new pricing mechanism improves LNG competitiveness in the power sector, and the trend is set to pick up in Asia next year.', 'Prakash Sharma, Head of Markets & Transitions, Asia-Pacific', 'Companies and investors will wake up to the fact that energy transition starts and ends with metals', '\\nMuch is being made of the energy transition and how companies and countries are adapting their strategies to be at the forefront of the shift to a lower-carbon world. The missing piece of the jigsaw is the fact that energy transition cannot and will not happen without the appropriate and timely development of the supply of metals. In 2020, the penny will drop that it isn\u2019t just about lithium and cobalt needed to feed the electric vehicle revolution, but it\u2019s more about the aluminium, copper, lead, zinc and nickel that will be needed to generate, transmit and store low- or zero-carbon power. 2020 is set to be the \u201cback to the future\u201d year, with energy companies looking at opportunities to invest in the raw material supply chain to ensure security of supply. Without appropriate support from either government agencies or deep-pocketed energy companies, metals may become the disabler of the energy transition as a lack of investment will limit the ability of the world to decarbonise. As the philosopher George Santayana said: \u201cThose who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\u201d', 'Julian Kettle, Vice-Chairman, Metals & Mining', 'Global carbon emissions are likely to rise again', '\\nGlobal greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise. To stay on track for limiting the rise in global temperatures to 2\u00b0C, emissions need to shift into a lower gear \u2013 contracting in some markets, fuels, and sectors \u2013 within the next 12 months. The problem is well understood, but responses are not: just look at the range of opinion post-COP 25 in Madrid. The shift to zero-carbon technologies \u2013 in terms of corporate strategy, capital investment, and human capital deployment \u2013 has progressed at a fast clip in 2019.This pace of change will not slow down in the year ahead. But global carbon emissions are still thought to have risen this year. How quickly society can respond to the global climate challenge will be reflected in 2020 emission data; the bellwether for progress.', 'David Brown, Head of Markets & Transitions, Americas', 'And finally, one from me:', 'The 2020 presidential election will be momentous for US energy', '\\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s election victory in 2016 has arguably not had a particularly large impact on the US energy industry.', 'Trends in oil and gas production that developed while Barack Obama was in office have continued, and the Trump administration has made little progress on his signature pledge to \u201cput the miners back to work\u201d in the coal industry.', 'The 2020 election may be different. A second Trump term will mean continuity, with further deregulation for the oil, gas and coal industries, and possibly another attempt to prop up economically challenged coal-fired power plants.', 'A Democratic president is likely to attempt to be more interventionist than Obama in pursuit of climate goals. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have said they would \u201cban fracking\u201d. Sanders has repeatedly said that \u201cfossil fuel executives should be criminally prosecuted for the destruction they have knowingly caused\u201d. Michael Bloomberg, a late entrant into the race to be the Democratic candidate, has set out a climate policy that includes a plan to close every coal-fired power plant in the US by 2030. Joe Biden, currently leading in the polls for the nomination, wants $500 billion a year invested in clean energy and environmental improvements, one-third of that from federal spending.', 'The reality is likely to fall short of the rhetoric, especially if a Democratic president faces a Republican-controlled Senate, but the campaign pledges point clearly to the direction of travel. A change of administration in 2021 would usher in one of the most significant shifts in energy strategy in US history.', 'Ed Crooks, Vice-Chair, Americas', '\\nQuote of the year', '\\n\u201cI am disappointed with the results of #COP25. The international community lost an important opportunity to show increased ambition on mitigation, adaptation and finance to tackle the climate crisis. But we must not give up, and I will not give up.\u201d \u2014 Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, secretary-general of the UN, reflected on the failure of the COP25 climate talks in Madrid, which ended on Sunday. The lack of progress at the meeting puts even more pressure on COP26, which will be held next November in Glasgow.', 'Chart of the year', '\\nThis is a version of a picture that I and WoodMac colleagues have been showing a lot this year. Its purpose is to emphasise the scale of the challenge involved in achieving the Paris climate agreement\u2019s goal of keeping the rise in global temperatures to \u201cwell below\u201d 2\u00b0C.', 'The highest line is the expected trajectory for global greenhouse gas emissions in our base-case forecast, with a plateau in the late 2020s. The second line down is the carbon constrained scenario, also known as the accelerated energy transition scenario. This essentially shows climate policies being pushed as far and as fast as is technically and politically possible. It shows a clear decline in emissions to 2040, but not enough to put the world on course for the Paris goal.', 'To do that, the path of emissions would have to be bent down to something like the lower line, which tracks the IEA\u2019s sustainable development scenario. The gaps between the top and bottom lines are a measure of how much additional effort would be needed to put us on track for a 2\u00b0C world. It is a daunting prospect.', 'Coming next', '\\nThis is the last Energy Pulse of 2019.

Ten years later, a half-dozen US LNG export facilities have sent out more than 3 Tcf of liquefied gas to dozens of countries.

The United States continued to export more natural gas than it imported in 2018, after being a net exporter in 2017 for the first time in nearly 60 years.', 'In September 2018, the United States exported more natural gas by pipeline than it imported by pipeline for the first time in at least 20 years. Forecasts in EIA\u2019s Short-Term Energy Outlook show that natural gas exports by pipeline will exceed natural gas imports by pipeline in 2019 for the year.', 'The Appalachian region remained the largest natural gas-producing region in the United States. Appalachian natural gas from the Marcellus and Utica/Point Pleasant shales of Ohio, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania continued to grow, with gross withdrawals increasing from 24.2 Bcf/d in 2017 to 28.5 Bcf/d in 2018. Ohio saw the largest percentage increase in gross withdrawals of natural gas, up 34%, in 2018 to 6.5 Bcf/d.', 'Texas saw the largest total volumetric gain in gross withdrawals in 2018, increasing to 24.1 Bcf/d, up from the state\u2019s 2017 production of 21.9 Bcf/d. Texas\u2019s increase in natural gas production is mainly because of the development in the Permian Basin and Haynesville Shale formation. According to EIA\u2019s Drilling Productivity Report, in 2018, production in the Permian increased by 2.7 Bcf/d, or 32%, while production in the Haynesville increased by 2.2 Bcf/d, or 34%.', '\\nSource: EIA']"

    "content": "['As production from the US Northeast stalls and the active rig count declines in the region, the market could tighten significantly and help propel Henry Hub futures later this winter.', 'The prompt month Henry Hub contract has tumbled more than 55 cents since early November and is currently hovering around $2.30/MMBtu. While weather has been largely unsupportive of US balances, flagging production, namely in the Northeast, and robust utilization of LNG facilities presents downside risk to end-of-winter storage levels, which S&P Global Platts Analytics currently has forecast at 2 Tcf at the end of March.', 'US production has averaged 91.8 Bcf/d month to date but dipped as low as 90.8 Bcf/d in recent days. This contrasts with Platts Analytics previous forecast of 92.9 Bcf/d for the balance of winter, a level just reached last month. The Northeast is driving the production decline due to the large decline in rigs and typical seasonal production profile that exhibits a strong end of year run-up before moderating at the start of January.', 'After peaking at 34 Bcf/d in mid-November, regional production has tumbled more than 1 Bcf/d, dipping as low as 32.4 Bcf/d on Monday, with declines spread across Northeast Pennsylvania, South Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Platts Analytics\u2019 forecast for Northeast production for the balance of winter (33.3 Bcf/d) sits about 0.9 Bcf/d above recent postings.', 'The current Northeast rig count, 49 as of Friday, is at a level sufficient to keep production flat through 2020, but additional rig declines could result in significant production declines in the region. Active rigs in the US Northeast one year ago totaled 77, according to data from Enverus.', 'Should an additional 20% of rigs be lost by March 2020, Platts Analytics finds Northeast production would average just 32.6 Bcf/d for the 2020 calendar year. At 33.2 Bcf/d month to date, a 20% cut to the rig fleet would see Northeast production fall to 31.6 Bcf/d by December 2020.', 'Also, LNG feedgas demand is exceeding Platts Analytics\u2019 forecast for the balance of winter, further tightening balances. Total US feedgas deliveries reached a new all-time high of 8.51 Bcf/d on Friday, with the recent surge driven by higher flows to Cameron and Sabine Pass.', 'Deliveries to Cameron reached a new high of 0.8 Bcf/d as commissioning activities ramp up for the facility\u2019s second train. Train 2 is scheduled to enter commercial service in April 2020. In addition to Cameron, deliveries to Sabine Pass strengthened back above 4.2 Bcf/d. US LNG feedgas is well on its way to another record-breaking monthly average with the current December average at 7.95 Bcf/d.', 'Taken together, if US production holds near 91 Bcf/d for the balance of winter, which is not out of the question given recent Northeast production readings and stalling drilling activity, there would be roughly 2 Bcf/d (or about 200 Bcf) of downside risk to end-of-March storage levels in the US.', 'Stocks could finish the winter about 200 to 250 Bcf below Platts Analytics\u2019 current forecast, leaving inventories around 1.7 Tcf exiting the winter. The tightness would likely extend into summer and present an upside risk to Henry Hub prices, especially if rig declines continue in the Northeast.', '\\nSource: ', '\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t']"

Trade issues not only led to reduction in global final consumption but also caused investment growth to decelerate. On the positive side, global trade slowdown has likely bottomed out, and now the negative trend in industrial production seen in 2019 is expected to reverse in 2020. As a result, global economic growth is forecast at 3.0% for both 2019 and 2020.', 'Recent progress on various trade agreements such as the conclusion of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership of Asian-Pacific nations may provide the base to re-energize the momentum in global trade, although challenges remain, particularly regarding ongoing trade talks between the US and its trade partners, particularly China.', 'While global monetary policies continue to be accommodative, high debt levels in many major economies represent some risk. Additional challenges are posed by fiscal issues in few EU Member Countries, Brexit, and Japan\u2019s ongoing slowdown. Fiscal imbalances in emerging and developing economies may also have a negative effect on global economic growth, while recent social unrest in some economies may add more downward pressure.', 'Global oil demand is projected to rise by 0.98 mb/d in 2019, mainly due to cooling macro-economic indicators in major economies. Oil demand in the OECD is projected to grow by a marginal 0.02 mb/d in 2019, due to slowerthan-expected demand in the Americas and Asia Pacific. Weaker-than-expected diesel requirements in the US amid the slower pace in manufacturing and construction activity have limited demand growth in the current year. In Asia Pacific, significant petrochemical plant turnarounds reduced demand for petrochemical feedstock in 1H19. In non-OECD oil demand in 2019 is anticipated to rise by 0.96 mb/d, primarily as a result of slower-than-expected demand in India due to reduced industrial and transportation fuel requirements in 2Q19 and 3Q19. In 2020, global oil demand is expected to grow by 1.08 mb/d, with the OECD growing by 0.07 mb/d. OECD Americas is anticipated to be the only OECD region in positive demand growth territory next year, supported mainly by petrochemical capacity additions. In the non-OECD region, oil demand growth is projected to be around 1.01 mb/d, with growth projected to improve in Other Asia, Latin America and the Middle East. Indeed, the transportation and petrochemical sectors are expected to continue leading oil demand growth in 2020.', 'On the supply side, non-OPEC oil supply growth in 2019 has been lower than initial market expectations, now standing at 1.82 mb/d compared to the initial projection of 2.10 mb/d in July 2018. Weaker-thanexpected growth in Canada, Brazil, Norway, Kazakhstan, China and Russia has been the key contributor to the downward revision, despite the betterthan-expected performance of US liquids supply. US oil output is leading this growth with 1.62 mb/d in 2019. In 2020, non-OPEC supply is expected to see a continued slowdown in growth on the back of decreased investment and lower drilling activities in US tight oil. Non-OPEC supply is now forecast to grow by 2.17 mb/d in 2020, representing a downward revision of around 0.27 mb/d from initial forecasts in July 2019 on the back of downward revisions in US oil supply. Nevertheless, Graph 2: World oil demand and non-OPEC supply revisions from initial forecast in 2019 and 2020 incremental production from the US tight plays, particularly in the Permian Basin, as well as from offshore fields in Norway, Brazil, Australia and possibly Guyana, will contribute to the non-OPEC supply in 2020.', 'Evidently, significant and successful effort of countries participating in the Declaration of Cooperation (DoC) have helped the global oil market to remain relatively balanced in 2019. Going forward, countries participating in the DoC reaffirmed their continuing commitment to oil market stability as they have decided this month to adjust production further by another 500 tb/d, adding to the previous adjustment of 1.2 mb/d, and now totalling to 1.7 mb/d as of January 2020.

In new deals, buyers are seeking shorter, more flexible terms, and some are even said to be seeking exit clauses in case the market changes dramatically during the contract term.', 'In existing 20-year contracts, it is not uncommon for there to be a so-called \u201cprice reopener\u201d clause that would allow the parties to renegotiate the price every five years to get closer to the market rate at that time, if it is widely out of alignment, said Meg Gentle, CEO of Driftwood LNG developer Tellurian and a former marketing chief at Cheniere Energy.', 'That makes it more important for developers to be nimble and consider alternative business models in trying to balance supply and demand, Gentle said.', '\u201cWe\u2019ll manage our marketing book tightly on a five-year forward-looking basis,\u201d Gentle said. \u201cSo, there\u2019s no need for a walkaway clause.

Production data from some other major global economic powerhouses have also begun showing signs of growth, indicating for the first time in months, that the slowdown in global growth and trade maybe finally bottoming out.', 'The Energy Information Agency (EIA) is now reporting that US crude inventory fell by 1.1 million barrels in the week to December 13 to 446.8m barrels, indicating a surge in consumption and some expectations of an uptick in demand next year.', 'Deeper production cuts coming from the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and its allies led by Russia also offered support to the markets, preventing any further slide. But that was not the major element behind the crude price movement, underlines Kemp.', '\u2018The (Opec) production cuts are a second-order effect. The rise in oil prices has been primarily driven by greater optimism about the outlook for global trade and the economy next year.\u2019', 'China and India are the major influencers of the oil markets today. As per BP, Chinese oil demand has been growing at an average annual rate of 5.5 per cent, whereas demand in India has been growing by some 5.1pc since 2008.', 'In sharp contrast, the US oil demand has only been climbing by 0.5pc per annum over the last decade and the consumption growth in OECD has in fact been contracting-albeit slowly-over the years.', 'With little energy resources of their own, both China and India are overwhelmingly reliant on imported oil, Kemp points out. While the Chinese crude consumption averaged 13.5m bpd in 2018, the percentage of imported oil in its total consumption is almost 70pc. While India is consuming 5.1m bpd of oil, 80pc of its requirements are met by imports.', 'However, despite the shale revolution and modest domestic demand growth, in absolute terms, the US remains the world\u2019s largest oil consumer, guzzling around 20m bpd of crude.', 'Markets also keep a close watch on the US data, its crude consumption and imports, week by week. As per the latest EIA report, the US imported 6.9m bpd of oil in the first week of December. This is more than a quarter of the US domestic consumption and also more than India\u2019s total consumption.', 'Any major movement in the US energy data hence continues to impact the markets significantly.', 'Kemp argues that the size of the US consumption, hence, makes the EIA\u2019s weekly petroleum status report popular among oil traders and others. Before taking a decision, they need to look at those figures closely. Only last week, after the EIA reported a smaller drawdown in the US inventory, crude markets pared some of its gains.', 'While some including the IEA still point to a coming glut, JP Morgan and few others have now interestingly begun looking the other way and raising their oil price forecasts for next year. As per JP Morgan\u2019s projections, rather than oversupply, the oil market will be in a deficit next year, by 200,000 bpd.', 'This is in stark contrast to its estimates from September that assumed a 600,000 bpd oversupply situation for 2020. It expects a 1m bpd global demand growth-the same as its September forecast.', 'Goldman Sachs has also revised upward its oil price forecast for next year. It is now expecting Brent crude oil to average $63 next year, with WTI averaging $58.50 per barrel, according to its revisions made last week. Yet, others, including the International Energy Agency, are pointing to the coming glut.', 'The fact is we are living in a seller\u2019s market. Saudi Arabia is no more the swing producer of the world and the Opec is no more in the driving seat. It is the consumers\u2019 who are literally in control of the crude markets.', '\\nSource: Dawn']"

    "title": "Why oil refining is a critical part of the energy industry",
    "content": "['It does not have the glamour of wildcatting in distant frontiers, nor the customer visibility of petrol stations, but oil refining is a critical part of the industry. It turns the gloopy black crude oil into the carefully tailored products, from petrol, diesel and jet fuel, to lubricants and feedstocks. A key part of Middle Eastern investment plans, refining is entering a more complex and pressured decade.', 'Instead of exporting raw materials, refining has traditionally been seen as a way for oil producers to \u2018add value\u2019 to their product. Refining margins also tend to outperform when oil prices drop. More recently, Middle Eastern states, notably Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Kuwait, have sought to guarantee offtake by investing in mega-refineries in their key emerging Asian markets, China, India, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia and others. And they have added petrochemical complexes to generate higher-value and more sophisticated outputs.', 'Still, refining faces three major challenges. First is overcapacity. World oil demand is expected to rise about 1-1.1 million barrels per day during this year, and 1.3 million bpd in 2020. But a wave of new refineries will increase capacity by 1.8 million bpd and more than 2.2 million bpd respectively. By 2021 it will be a little slower (and some of the planned 2020 refineries may slip into the year after), but 2022 is another strong year with 1.8 million bpd expected.', 'This gain comes mostly from giant new refineries in China, the Middle East and one big plant in Nigeria built by tycoon Aliko Dangote. Adnoc plans to create the world\u2019s largest refining and petrochemical complex at Ruwais, adding a new 600,000 bpd refinery around 2024. Kuwait is upgrading two refineries to produce cleaner fuels, and building a third giant greenfield facility, while Oman is constructing a big refinery with Kuwaiti investment at its south-eastern port of Duqm. There are smaller projects in the UAE at Enoc\u2019s Jebel Ali refinery and Brooge\u2019s Fujairah oil storage terminal. Iran and Iraq also have a range of refining projects of varying sizes and realism.', 'If refining capacity is in surplus, some will have to run below maximum rates, and even shut down. This is most likely in Europe and Japan, where both oil demand and production have been dropping for years, energy costs and wages are high and imported crude more costly. However, closing refineries is difficult \u2013 they have serious environmental legacies, local politicians tend to resist large layoffs of workers, and governments prefer self-sufficiency in refining to assure a secure supply of fuels.', 'Meanwhile, plants in the Middle East, developing Asia and North America are more competitive, being large and modern and having easy access to feedstock. Surplus Chinese products are exported to Asian neighbours, but they want to retain their own refineries to avoid dependence on Beijing.', 'The second challenge is the possible peak in demand for oil. Improved vehicle efficiency, tighter environmental standards, a slowing Chinese economy, replacement of oil by natural gas, and the rise of electric vehicles, can combine to drive oil consumption into permanent and inexorable decline. When this will happen is a matter of debate, with estimates ranging anywhere from the mid-2020s to the mid-2040s or beyond. But for refinery investments predicated on a payback of more than a decade, and decades more of useful life after that, the prospect is worrying.', 'The situation is worse than it sounds, because a growing share of final oil demand is not derived from crude oil. It comes from natural gas liquids, a by-product of gas production that is booming particularly in the US; from biofuels made from crops and plant waste; and from synthetic fuels derived from coal in China. So the peak of refining runs will come before a peak in overall oil consumption.', 'To cope with this prospect, new refineries are typically integrated with petrochemicals production. This brings cost-saving synergies, and adds value and diversity of outputs. While road fuel demand is expected to go into decline in the foreseeable future, demand for petrochemicals \u2013 producing plastics, rubber, paint, glue, fibres and a host of other products \u2013 is anticipated to keep rising. In developing countries, it grows faster than the economy.', 'Petrochemicals are therefore seen as a hedge against \u201cpeak demand\u201d. New Chinese plants are usually designed for a high output of petrochemicals. Saudi Aramco plans a $20 billion (Dh73bn), 400,000 bpd plant at Yanbu to turn crude oil directly into chemicals without going through a refining step, though this may be rethought following its acquisition of compatriot Saudi Arabia Basic Industries Corporation.', 'The third concern for refiners is tightening environmental standards. On January 1, 2020, new regulations reducing the allowable amount of sulphur in shipping fuel go into force. This is bad news for simple refineries with a high output of sulphurous fuel oil. It will be favourable, though, for complex plants that can desulphurise crude.', 'In the longer term, measures will be taken intended to clean up the oceans, which may dampen petrochemical growth. There will be more emphasis on recycling and using biomaterials as inputs. And refineries\u2019 greenhouse gas emissions will come into focus as climate change policies tighten. Refiners will have to keep improving energy efficiency, incorporate renewable energy, and install systems to capture their carbon dioxide.', 'Building refining capacity at home and abroad is a key part of most Middle Eastern states\u2019 energy strategies. As the industry\u2019s challenges grow, they will have to be disciplined, innovative and highly efficient to make a success of these investments.', '\\nSource: The National ']"

    "content": "['Declared dead prematurely in 2018, the era of lower-for-longer oil prices is eating into the coffers of oil-dependent nations and forcing many to loosen fiscal terms to keep international investors happy. ', 'They have little choice \u2014 at least if they want to keep the oil flowing. The American shale oil revolution has flooded global markets with cheap oil, putting an end to the heady years when oil topped $100 per barrel. At the same time, the world\u2019s accelerating transition to renewable energy, buttressed by carbon taxes, has shifted the prevailing calculus: the incentive to sell oil while there is still a market for it is growing, a dynamic that could force long-term prices still lower. ', 'Both developments have stolen leverage from oil-producing nations and handed it to international oil companies. Globetrotting goliaths like Shell or ExxonMobil hardly need stick around if a host country refuses to lower taxes when prices fall. They can pack up and head elsewhere. ', '\u201c[O]wners of higher-cost resources will need to offer increasingly attractive contracts and fiscal terms to ensure their oil remains competitive and able to attract the private-sector investment needed to extract it,\u201d according to BP\u2019s chief economist, Spencer Dale, and the director of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, Bassam Fattouh. ', 'In other words: the jig is up. ', 'Reading the writing on the wall', 'One by one, they have yielded. ', 'After three painful years of economic stagnation, Angola recently slashed headline tax rates on smaller oil fields from 20% to 10%, while its state-owned energy giant, Sonangol, is selling off non-core assets. Little wonder: since the oil price crash of 2014, companies have scoffed at the large upfront costs Angola demanded in exchange for fresh capital spending on the large offshore rigs required to dredge oil from beneath the ocean there. ', 'In Algeria, where years have passed with scant new oil investment and the economy has sagged, the lower house of parliament last month passed a measure that would reduce taxes on oil and gas extraction. The bill still faces passage in the upper chamber, but experts say that lowering taxes is critical if the country wants to revive its oil sector. (As in Angola, oil revenue provides more than 90% of Algeria\u2019s foreign exchange earnings.) ', 'Both OPEC members may well be trying to replicate the success of a third. In July Gabon lowered taxes and relaxed state ownership over the oil sector, part of an overhaul of its hydrocarbons code. It was a gusher: Gabon recently signed several new contracts with oil producing firms, including Houston-based Vaalco and Malaysia\u2019s state-owned group Petronas. ', 'The trio of OPEC nations isn\u2019t alone. In India and Indonesia, reforms to meant to entice investors are underway. In licensing rounds that the UK held in 2017, new types of licenses with flexible terms were on offer. ', 'Others could soon follow in their footsteps. In October, Russia\u2019s energy minister said that unless Russia lowered taxes it would soon become uncompetitive with oil producing countries such as the United States, where oil-rich shale fields have lured investors from around the world with their lower capital costs. ', 'Yet not all are following this trend. The oil industry in Nigeria, Africa\u2019s largest oil producer, champs at the bit for an investor-friendly overhaul, a part of which is named the Petroleum Industry Governance Bill, that has languished for years. But under the leadership of president Muhammadu Buhari \u2014 who has a penchant for state intervention \u2014 Nigeria may actually increase taxes on deepwater oil production, a move that the International Energy Agency warned in November \u201ccould make investments far less attractive and threaten future development.\u201d ', 'Ironically, if Nigeria does push through the tax increase, it would be doing so largely because it badly needs to replenish revenues that have gone missing since a mid-2014 oil price crash. New taxes would surely generate short-term revenue. But if investor sentiment suffers, Nigeria may well decide in coming years that it simply can\u2019t hold out against the tyranny of low prices.  ', 'Stuck in the down position', 'Carole Nakhle, an energy economist, has a word for the ebb and flow of the fiscal conditions that oil-rich countries impose on oil companies: the \u201cpendulum effect.\u201d When oil prices rise, host countries ratchet up taxes and other terms to squeeze a larger share of profits out of companies. When prices fall back down, countries lower taxes back down again. They can\u2019t afford the risk of scaring away the companies, whose expertise is crucial in getting the black stuff out of the ground. ', 'Since a massive collapse of oil prices in 2014, the pendulum has been swinging down again. Except this time there may be no swinging back up. ', 'When Saudi Arabia turned on the taps in 2014, in a bid to drive American shale oil producers out of the market, prices collapsed by more than 50%. Oil companies slashed capital spending, investing $779 billion in 2014 but only $583 billion in 2015. Today, prices have recovered but remain well below a decade ago, and oil firms still probably can\u2019t recover costs at oil fields with breakeven prices below $60, according to Rystad Energy. So they\u2019ve mostly steered clear of any countries, like Angola or Algeria, that hadn\u2019t relaxed their fiscal terms. ', 'In worse news for oil producers, a consensus is forming that oil prices may never again reach the heights of 2013 and early 2014, at least not for any long period of time. Anytime oil prices again rise too high, the thinking goes, resilient US shale oil producers will come back online in droves, boosting global supplies and pulling prices back down again. Nor is it likely that oil demand will sustain a renewed rise in prices. Economists anticipate that the world\u2019s demand for oil \u2014 currently running at some 100 million barrels per day \u2014 could peak sometime in the mid- to late-2020s and decline thereafter. As producers scramble to sell their oil reserves while there is still a market for them, prices could tumble further. ', 'It has taken some time, but the spate of oil-producing countries which have begun to lower the drawbridge to investors \u2014 including many in Africa, where capital is notoriously flighty \u2014 is a sign that reality has caught up with them, experts say. ', '\u201cLower oil prices drive political acceptance and support of investment,\u201d Nakhle wrote last year. \u201cIn today\u2019s climate, pro-investment policy reforms are more evident as countries compete harder for global capital.\u201d  ', 'The era of lower-for-longer oil prices era has also handed leverage back to the majors. Giant companies like ExxonMobil, which makes a quarter of a trillion dollars annually and operates around the world, have little incentive to stick around in a given country if the government refuses to lower taxes on oil extraction; they can simply head elsewhere. In fact, whether a country has friendly investment terms or not is arguably the most important criterion for investors. The additional costs imposed by fiscal regimes are the largest single source of cost differences among oil-producing nations, according to data from Rystad Energy. In other words, for firms, the oil itself matters less than the terms attached to it. ', 'Companies may also be benefiting from a fundamental shift in the nature of energy markets. In her 2017 book \u201cWindfall,\u201d Harvard\u2019s Meghan O\u2019Sullivan argues that the US shale revolution, in addition to robbing market share from OPEC and its allies, has shifted the power balance away from producers back toward consumers and the companies that supply them. If oil is abundant and comes from a variety of sources, companies need not pay fealty to a given country or countries. In an apt illustration of the principle, O\u2019Sullivan recalls how, in 2014, Russia\u2019s state-owned Gazprom cut off gas supplies to Ukraine, which had no other ready source of gas. It was a blatant exercise of power, demonstrating the power that producers enjoyed over consumers. Since then, though, a profusion of US natural gas supplies has created new markets, including across the Atlantic. Russia would probably struggle to starve Ukraine of gas today, since Ukraine would able to access supplies from Europe. (It would still be painful.) ', 'Of course, unlike natural gas, oil has long been a global market, with tankers sailing around the world for decades. Nevertheless, with projections showing that the US is poised to join Saudi Arabia and Russia as top oil exporters and Brazil anticipating its own production growth spurt, the source of global flows of oil are steadily becoming more diverse. ', '\u201cIn the past, when oil production was more concentrated, [producers] could act more like a cartel and keep prices [e.g., taxes] high in the face of decreasing demand,\u201d said Ben Ho, a former lead energy economist at the White House Council for Economic Advisers. \u201cWith more competition, oil producing countries have less market power and therefore respond more immediately to shifts in demand.\u201d  ', 'As oil prices drift lower, what of development? ', 'For now, oil prices have recovered. The price of a barrel of Brent crude touched $52 a year ago, but a recent trifecta of extended production cuts by OPEC and its allies, a tentative US-China trade deal, and unexpectedly strong global growth have pushed the price back up above $65 per barrel. ', 'Still, few doubt that in the long term prices will come down and stay down. In an email, Ho wrote: \u201cI think there is a general expectation that both in the near term (potential for global recession which always has a big demand effect) and the long term (as new oil technologies, not to mention climate change regulation and electric cars) will dramatically bend the trajectory of future oil demand and thus future oil prices.\u201d ', 'What does that mean for many developing nations, who have long depended on their ample oil reserves for economic growth? Some observers say the oil slump of 2014 jolted these countries out of their complacency. If access to plenty of oil is in fact a \u201cdisease\u201d \u2014 in that it enables countries to forego difficult reforms, such as implementing taxes and rooting out corruption \u2014 then the hard reality of terminally declining oil revenue could be a welcome shove in the direction of needed reforms. ', 'Angola is a case study in the corrupting power of oil wealth and a sign of what could lie ahead. Between 2002, the year it staggered free of a 27-year-long civil war, and 2010, oil production soared from 300,000 barrels per day to a peak of 2 million. Angola\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) hitched a ride, rising from $15 billion in 2002 to $146 billion in 2014. As recounted in A Magnificent and Beggar Land, a post-civil war history of the country, these were years of excess. Under longtime leader Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos, Angola built up its gleaming capital Luanda into the world\u2019s most expensive city for foreigners \u2014 \u201cthe facade of modernity, and to hell with the plumbing\u201d \u2014 but its industrial ventures often amounted to imitations of productive enterprise rather than the genuine article. Poverty remains widespread and corruption is among the worst in the world. Transparency International ranks Angola 165th most corrupt out of 180 nations. ', 'Yet today there are signs of change. President Joao Lourenco, who took office in late 2017, has so far taken all the right steps to begin to tackle corruption, experts say, and the country is working harder than ever to diversify its economic base away from oil. ', 'The party may be ending, but the work has begun.', '\\nSource: Forbes']"

Natural gas consumption reached a record high, rising by 10% from 2017. This increase in natural gas, along with relatively smaller increases in the consumption of petroleum fuels, renewable energy, and nuclear electric power, more than offset a 4% decline in coal consumption.', 'Petroleum consumption in the United States increased to 20.5 million barrels per day (b/d), or 37 quadrillion Btu in 2018, up nearly 500,000 b/d from 2017 and the highest level since 2007. Growth was driven primarily by increased use in the industrial sector, which grew by about 200,000 b/d in 2018. The transportation sector grew by about 140,000 b/d in 2018 as a result of increased demand for fuels such as petroleum diesel and jet fuel.', 'Natural gas consumption in the United States reached a record high 83.1 billion cubic feet/day (Bcf/d), the equivalent of 31 quadrillion Btu, in 2018. Natural gas use rose across all sectors in 2018, primarily driven by weather-related factors that increased demand for space heating during the winter and for air conditioning during the summer. As more natural gas-fired power plants came online and existing natural gas-fired power plants were used more often, natural gas consumption in the electric power sector increased 15% from 2017 levels to 29.1 Bcf/d. Natural gas consumption also grew in the residential, commercial, and industrial sectors in 2018, increasing 13%, 10%, and 4% compared with 2017 levels, respectively.', 'Coal consumption in the United States fell to 688 million short tons (13 quadrillion Btu) in 2018, the fifth consecutive year of decline. Almost all of the reduction came from the electric power sector, which fell 4% from 2017 levels. Coal-fired power plants continued to be displaced by newer, more efficient natural gas and renewable power generation sources. In 2018, 12.9 gigawatts (GW) of coal-fired capacity were retired, while 14.6 GW of net natural gas-fired capacity were added.', 'Renewable energy consumption in the United States reached a record high 11.5 quadrillion Btu in 2018, rising 3% from 2017, largely driven by the addition of new wind and solar power plants. Wind electricity consumption increased by 8% while solar consumption rose 22%. Biomass consumption, primarily in the form of transportation fuels such as fuel ethanol and biodiesel, accounted for 45% of all renewable consumption in 2018, up 1% from 2017 levels. Increases in wind, solar, and biomass consumption were partially offset by a 3% decrease in hydroelectricity consumption.', 'Nuclear consumption in the United States increased less than 1% compared with 2017 levels but still set a record for electricity generation in 2018. The number of total operable nuclear generating units decreased to 98 in September 2018 when the Oyster Creek Nuclear Generating Station in New Jersey was retired.

So far, the market\u2019s expectationthat the backwardated structure of the Middle East crude market will ease along with a slowdown in demand for high sulfur crudes, has not panned out.', 'OFFICIAL SELLING PRICES SET TO ALIGN', '\\nAnother big step in 2020 will be updates to the pricing methodologies of some of the region\u2019s producers, which will align Middle Eastern crudes in a directly comparable manner. This will in turn bring greater transparency to andput more purchasing power in the hands of the Asian refiner.', 'Currently, with the exception of UAE\u2019s Abu Dhabi National Oil Company and Qatar Petroleum, all Middle East producers price their oil to Asian customers on a forward month pricing mechanism.', 'Both state-owned entities have announced concrete plans to do away with retrospective pricing formulas to forward pricing, a move widely expected by the industry to be implemented within the first quarter of 2020.', 'Additionally, ADNOC announced in November, plans for its flagship crude grade Murban, to be listed on the Intercontinental Exchange in a bid to create a new regional benchmark for light crude in the first half of the year on a new Abu Dhabi exchange in partnership with nine international energy companies. The move will add a new dimension to the dynamics of Middle East crude trading.', '\u201cThe attraction with Murban is that due to its liquidity and the nature of its pricing and trading cycle, forward trading is very possible and will come about naturally,\u201d the head of crude trading based in Singapore said.', '\u201cAnd because of that, a forward derivative market for it could develop with ease. Another benefit is that it iscomparable to the other light benchmarks such as WTI and Brent.\u201d', 'But as of now, market participants are watching with controlled optimism.', 'While 2019 will be remembered in global crude oil markets as a year of unexpected and high risk events in the Middle East, the year ahead will cement a crucial transition for the world\u2019s largest oil producing and exporting region: one where it plays a more proactive, dynamic and global role in shaping oil markets than ever before.', '\\nSource: ', '\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t']"

The combined capacity of the two lines is 86.5 Bcm \u2014 almost exactly the volume transited via Ukraine in 2018 (86.8 Bcm).', 'But any delay to the construction of the two projects would inevitably bring Ukraine back into play.', 'And when the US rushed through specific new sanctions against any company laying pipe for Nord Stream 2 and TurkStream \u2014 followed by pipelayer Allseas suspending its operations on Saturday \u2014 it became clear that there was no way Nord Stream 2 would be completed anywhere near on time.', 'S&P Global Platts Analytics believes there is a workaround for completing Nord Stream 2 using Russian vessels, but the start of Nord Stream 2 will likely be delayed by a further six months to Q4 2020.', 'TRANSIT DEAL', '\\nMany industry watchers were of the opinion that Moscow would wait until the last minute to agree a new deal with Ukraine \u2014 a cliff-edge December 31 agreement was considered a likely scenario.', 'But it looks like Russia ran out of options if it wanted to maintain stable supplies to its European customers in 2020 and the US sanctions were the last straw.', 'The transit deal was lauded Monday by European Commission vice president Maros Sefcovic as \u201can opportunity to hit a reset button in relations between Russia and Ukraine.\u201d', 'That remains to be seen.', 'But both sides have had to compromise to reach the new transit agreement, which is set to be signed off by Gazprom and Naftogaz by December 29.', 'For Russia\u2019s Gazprom, agreeing to pay the near $3 billion arbitration bill to Ukraine\u2019s Naftogaz will be a bitter pill to swallow.', 'The net $2.56 billion award \u2014 now closer to $3 billion with interest \u2014 made by the Stockholm court in February 2018 had been dismissed and challenged by Gazprom as unfair.', 'Gazprom has always insisted it would never pay up, saying the ruling was politically skewed.', 'But it is important to remember that under the new protocol agreed on Friday, Gazprom will be let off a separate $6.7 billion fine imposed on the company by Ukraine in 2016 for the Russian company\u2019s alleged abuse of its monopoly position on the Ukrainian market.', 'And in early November, Naftogaz made a new $12 billion arbitration claim seeking compensation from Gazprom for its refusal to accept market-based gas transit tariffs in 2018 and 2019.', 'Simply put, the legal dispute was intensifying and Gazprom had already been on the losing end.', 'Stumping up $3 billion, but having all other legal claims cancelled \u2014 including attempts by Naftogaz to seize and sell Gazprom assets globally \u2014 is not a bad outcome.', 'UKRAINE VOLUMES', '\\nUkraine had to compromise too, not only in dropping all the other claims against Gazprom.', 'Kyiv \u2014 and Brussels \u2014 had been angling for a 10-year transit deal, but in the end they had to settle for a five-year accord.', 'Next year transit volumes will only be 65 Bcm, and volumes will fall to just 40 Bcm/year from 2021-2024.', 'That will suit Gazprom to some extent as it ramps up flows through Nord Stream 2 and TurkStream. At least the pressure is off for Gazprom to complete Nord Stream 2 and the onshore extension of TurkStream into southeast Europe quickly.', 'The new test, then, will come in December 2024 when this new accord will expire.', 'So we\u2019ll likely be back in exactly the same place then, with Russia unlikely to want to agree to volumes of that level again and Ukraine seeking a continued transit role.', 'And given that both sides ignored the previous agreement from 2009 for much of the term of the accord, any change in relations between Moscow and Kyiv could see the start of yet another gas spat.', '\\nSource:\\xa0', '\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t']"

    "content": "['Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) has launched a new licensing round for four marginal field clusters, with the bidding process open from October 2019 to May 2020, according to the national oil firm\u2019s Activity Outlook 2020-2022.', 'Described as discovered resources opportunities (DRO) clusters, they are the Diwangsa and Rhu-Ara shallow water clusters located off the shores of Peninsular Malaysia, and the Kerisi and Bambazon clusters located offshore Sabah.', 'The Diwangsa cluster comprises four fields about 275km off the shores of Kemaman, Terengganu, while the Rhu-Ara cluster comprises two fields 150km from the shores of Pahang.', 'The Kerisi cluster, 115km from the shores of Sabah, contains four fields with water depths averaging 1,200m to 1,500m. The Bambazon cluster comprises two shallow water fields around 20km offshore northwest Sabah.', 'It has been six years since the national oil firm shelved the development of marginal oilfields in the country.', 'In 2013, it opened its third risk-service contract (RSC) licensing round involving 10 marginal fields. At the time, Petronas formed its own unit, Vestigo Petroleum Sdn Bhd, to focus on the venture. Crude oil prices were above US$100 per barrel then, which made the development of marginal fields commercially viable.', 'In a nutshell, a marginal field is deemed as \u201cstranded\u201d and the risk of it becoming uneconomically viable is usually higher. Its development cost tends to be higher compared with conventional oilfields and the per unit cost could be substantially higher.', 'It has been reported that for such a field to be economically viable, the breakeven price has to be slightly above US$60/bbl relative to the barrel of oil raised \u2014 although some contractors have argued that it could be lower, depending on the geological structure of the oilfield.', 'Crude oil prices have bounced back from below US$30 in 2016 to their current range of US$50 to US$65 per barrel. Still, the price is far below the peak of US$100 in 2014.', 'Thus, that Petronas is relooking at developing marginal oilfields has raised some eyebrows.', 'The prolonged oil price crash of 2014 to 2016 was deemed to have reduced the industry\u2019s appetite for such ventures.', 'Brent has averaged at US$64/bbl this year, and Petronas has benchmarked its oil price for working assumption at US$55/bbl for next year, although market watchers are expecting prices to rise to the \u201cnew norm\u201d of US$70/bbl in the long run.', 'Meanwhile, it is unclear what model Petronas will deploy to develop the marginal fields this time around.', 'Under the RSC structure \u2014 awarded in 2011 \u2014 Petronas took on the development risk, with contractors reimbursed for the capital expenditure incurred during the undertaking.', 'However, there were scant details on the terms of each RSC that Petronas signed with the respective companies.', 'To recap, two RSCs ceased in 2016. One was a joint venture (JV) between Dialog Group Bhd, Roc Oil Co Ltd and Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd, which was reimbursed US$10 million by Petronas for the capex spent.', 'The other was a JV involving Kencana Petroleum Bhd and SapuraCrest Petroleum Bhd (both companies later merged, with the merged entity now known as Sapura Energy Bhd) together with Petrofac Ltd.', 'Petronas\u2019 Vestigo took over the Berantai RSC from the Sapura JV.', 'Four local RSCs of the 2013 licensing round actually struck oil. They are the JV between Petra Energy Bhd and Coastal Energy Co; Uzma Bhd and EnQuest Plc; and Scomi Energy Services Bhd, Octanex Pte Ltd and Vestigo.', 'Vestigo also undertook its own RSC without a partner at the Tembikai field, off the shores of Terengganu, and struck oil in 2015.', 'All said, there was one instance when a Malaysian marginal field ended up becoming a major find.', 'In 2013, a JV of Petronas Carigali Sdn Bhd developed the Cendor marginal field offshore Peninsular Malaysia, which turned out to be one of the biggest oilfields in Malaysia, according to Petronas.', 'Apart from the four marginal clusters, Petronas had also opened eight exploration blocks coupled with four discoveries for bidding \u2014 PM326 offshore Kelantan, PM416 and PM254 offshore Terengganu, PM417 offshore Pahang, as well as SB25T, SB408, SB414 and SB410 offshore and onshore Sabah.', 'Subsequently, Petronas also opened three late life assets (LLA) technical studies for bidding, namely the Tembungo field in Sabah, and two groups in Terengganu \u2014 the Malong-Sotong-Anding or MASA fields, and the Bujang, Inas, Sepat, Guling and Tujoh or BIGST fields.', '\\nSource: The Edge Malaysia']"

    "content": "['Global oil markets notched up a number of milestones this year that echoed the story of the past decade: the world has shifted from an era of supply tightness to plenty.', 'What distinguished the developments of 2019 was not just how big they were but often how little impact they had. From the world\u2019s biggest-ever initial public offering to its worst-ever supply disruption, a barrage of sanctions on exporters to two OPEC interventions, never before had so many momentous events left investors so unmoved.', 'At the heart of that indifference was the force that has transformed world energy balances over the past 10 years: the American revolution in shale oil and gas, which is cushioning global markets against shocks that would once have sent prices rocketing. This too achieved a landmark in 2019, turning the U.S. into an net exporter of crude and refined oil.', 'And there was another turning point showing the years ahead may also be marked by supply abundance. For the first time, the world\u2019s leading energy institution predicted that demand for oil \u2014 once expected to keep growing almost indefinitely \u2014 will stall at the turn of the next decade.', '\u201cThis year is probably the first in my recollection where oil prices so extremely decoupled from geopolitical risk,\u201d said Amy Myers Jaffe, senior energy and environment fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. \u201cIt was also the year when analysts and car companies started to talk about the possibility of peak car and peak demand with increasing probability.\u201d', 'The biggest headlines of 2019 came out of the world\u2019s largest oil exporter, Saudi Arabia. Riyadh finally floated part of state oil giant Saudi Aramco after a laborious three-year process, securing a valuation of $2 trillion that made it the world\u2019s biggest company.', 'Yet the 1.5% stake sold was just a portion of the original plan, and mostly marketed to local buyers instead of the foreign investors once courted, as fund managers balked at the lofty asking price.', 'A far more traumatic ordeal rocked Saudi Arabia in September, when a swarm of missiles and armed drones blasted its Abqaiq processing facility and briefly disabled half the kingdom\u2019s output capacity. Yemen\u2019s Houthi rebel group claimed responsibility, although the U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo blamed Iran directly.', 'The sudden loss of 5.7 million barrels a day was exactly the crisis the industry had feared for decades, and in previous years might have triggered a prolonged rally. Although prices initially rocketed 19% in an unprecedented surge, the gains dissipated in two weeks.', 'Riyadh\u2019s attempts to shore up oil prices also yielded lackluster results. The Saudis led the OPEC cartel and its partners in not one but two coordinated production cutbacks this year, an unusual level of activity for the organization, and reduced its own output far more than initially planned.', 'Their efforts were amplified by extreme levels of political involvement in the oil market, as U.S. sanctions squeezed exports from OPEC members Iran and Venezuela to the lowest in decades. Yet prices remain about 12% below this year\u2019s high, trading near $66 a barrel in London.', 'The main source of the cartel\u2019s struggle remained the U.S. shale-oil industry, which has turned the country into the world\u2019s biggest oil producer, and propelled nationwide production to a new record of almost 13 million barrels a day this year.', 'Even as the shale boom shows some signs of slowing, production from offshore deposits once thought unviable in an era of low prices \u2014 such as Brazil and Norway \u2014 is springing to life.', '\u201cDespite major geopolitical tensions around the world, oil markets have remained surprisingly calm,\u201d said Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency in Paris. \u201cThis is mainly due to significant amounts of oil supply coming into the market from the U.S. as a result of the shale revolution, and from other non-OPEC producers.\u201d', 'The transformation though isn\u2019t confined to the supply side of the market.', 'The IEA, which for years projected that oil demand would increase for the foreseeable future, predicted last month that consumption will plateau at the turn of the next decade as efforts to avert catastrophic climate change spur the use of more efficient car engines and electric cars.', 'Growth in world oil demand will dwindle from about 1 million barrels a day, or 1%, currently to roughly 100,000 a day in the 2030s, the IEA said. Sales of passenger vehicles with internal combustion engines are probably already in decline, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.', 'The change is increasingly occupying financial investors, who are shifting their portfolios from fossil fuels to more sustainable energy sources. Reflecting that anxiety, the organizers of the \u201cOil & Money\u201d conference, held annually in London for the past four decades, announced a re-branding that will remove both words from the title.', 'Perhaps the greatest symbol of changing attitudes has been the rise of 16-year-old Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg. The \u201cstrike for climate\u201d she began at school last year became a global phenomenon, leading her to address the United Nations in New York and earn Time magazine\u2019s \u2018Person of the Year\u2019 award \u2014 a level of international popularity the organizers of the Aramco IPO can only dream of.', '\\nSource: Bloomberg']"

While this could make it difficult for benchmark crude oil prices to break out of the $60 to $65 a barrel range, where they\u2019ve stalled for several months, it\u2019s good news for consumers. ', 'American drivers have, on average, paid well below $3 a gallon for regular unleaded gasoline over the past year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Low gas prices have contributed to solid economic performance, with 2.1% annualized GDP growth in the third quarter. ', 'The question is whether this period of moderate energy costs is sustainable? In short, yes. That is, at least for another year. While there are threats to oil price stability, most risks are to the downside, ultimately benefiting consumers, but could prove disappointing for U.S. energy companies.  ', 'Russia and Saudi-led OPEC producers continue to demonstrate their commitment to higher oil prices by cutting production to avoid a plunge in prices. The so-called \u201cOPEC+\u201d group will enter its fourth consecutive year of production cuts in 2020. ', 'Recently, the group agreed to deepen production cuts by an additional 500,000 barrels, removing a total of 1.7 million barrels a day from the market. A further slash of 400,000 daily barrels in Saudi production is also possible but is contingent upon members doing a better job of complying with the production-cut agreement.  ', 'The International Energy Agency (IEA) contends that because the rise of non-OPEC oil supply has been slower than original estimates, coupled with the fact that the OPEC+ production cuts are greater than anticipated, the deficit my result in an unbalanced market. Especially in the first half of 2020. ', 'Non-OPEC supply, led by the U.S. shale, is forecast to grow by 2.1 million barrels a day in 2020, according to the IEA\u2019s latest monthly Oil Market Report. That is 200,000 barrels a day lower than the Paris-based agency projected in November, reflecting the recent slowdown in drilling activity and investment in U.S. shale. ', 'Global demand for oil is set to increase by 1.2 million barrels a day next year. That\u2019s a lower growth rate than previously anticipated, which means the world will need 900,000 fewer barrels of oil every day from both OPEC and non-OPEC producers alike. ', 'The additional production cuts agreed to by the OPEC+ group earlier this month in Vienna are a response to IEA\u2019s lower growth expectations. However, the additional cuts are not enough to avoid a build-up of inventories. ', 'Even if OPEC and its partners keep the output cut in place beyond its spring expiration date and through the end of 2020, increased production from other parts of the world, primarily from U.S. shale, will still cause a build-up of inventories, according to the EIA. More inventory points to lower prices. ', 'Forecasts call for a decrease in international oil prices, on average, from $64 in 2019 to $61 a barrel in 2020, and prices on the U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) averaging $5.50 lower than the Brent price in the new year. ', 'The spending plans of international oil companies are already starting to reflect the new bearish outlook. Oslo-based consultancy Rystad Energy is anticipating overall global investment in exploration and production (E&P) to decrease by approximately 4%.', 'Investment in shale oil is expected to contract more than other oil basins \u2014 by almost 12%. Investor demands for higher returns mean shale producers need to raise prices to improve their margins before justifying higher investment rates. ', 'The problem for OPEC+ is that the slowdown in U.S. shale may not happen fast enough for its members, who are growing tired of giving up market share and subsidizing American producers.', 'OPEC leader Saudi Arabia wants higher prices to support the record IPO of its state oil giant Aramco. They also need to shore up fiscal deficits and are losing patience working to secure supply cuts while other OPEC+ members continually fail to comply with agreements. ', 'Iraq, Nigeria, and Russia have notably fallen short of full compliance with reduction quotas in recent months, a issue that has not gone unnoticed by other OPEC members. Saudi Arabia took an unusually aggressive stance at the OPEC+ meetings earlier this month, threatening to boost oil production unilaterally if other cartel members continue to defy the output restrictions.', 'The Saudi\u2019s tough talk raises questions about the overall cohesion of the OPEC+ alliance. Flooding the market with oil and reducing prices is not beneficial to any member of the cartel. However, with the lowest extraction costs in the world, Saudi Arabia is best-equipped to handle a low-price scenario. ', 'The main concern for OPEC+ members remains the continual loss of space for its oil in the global market due to the growth of U.S. shale. ', 'The IEA sees space in the market for 29 million additional incremental barrels a day of oil from OPEC countries in 2020. That number continues to follow a downward trend from an estimated 29.9 million barrels a day in 2019 and 30.8 million in 2018. ', 'The growth in shale output should slow further as access to capital tightens \u2013 IHS Markit predicts growth will drop to 440,000 barrels a day next year and flatten further in 2021 \u2013 but U.S. producers aren\u2019t going to go quietly into that good night.  ', 'Rystad believes the shale sector will continue to expand, even under lower prices and shrinking investment, well into the early part of the next decade. Rystad\u2019s analyst believe WTI prices would have to fall to an average of $45 a barrel to have a sustained impact on America\u2019s prolific shale plays. ', 'Therefore, 2020 will be a critical year for oil markets. If U.S. shale continues to defy expectations and register production growth close to the forecasted 900,000 barrels a day \u2013 as EIA forecasts \u2013 the cohesion of the OPEC+ group will face continued challenges. ', 'Those challenges could translate into an increasingly unpredictable future for Saudi Arabia and, possibly, an end to the era of OPEC and Russia production deals. If that happens, all bets are off for what the future holds for oil markets for 2020 and beyond.', '\\nSource: Forbes']"

In November, Chevron sold its 9.6% stake in Azerbaijan\u2019s main oil complex, Azeri-Chirag-Deepwater Gunashli (ACG), and ExxonMobil says it wants to sell its 7% stake, as both majors focus on shale resources at home.', 'Oil production from the BP-operated ACG has fallen 8% in 2019 and is now around a third below 2010 levels, at 540,000 b/d in the first nine months of the year.', 'In Kazakhstan, production is still considered broadly on the rise, but a hard-bitten industry is increasingly skeptical of the cost of projects. Holders of Chevron stock reacted badly recently to news of a $10 billion increase in the cost of a project to expand the country\u2019s largest producer, the Tengiz field, along with a delay to the project.', 'It is perhaps unsurprising the industry has moved on from the days when the Caspian was seen alongside the likes of Angola as a solution to a perceived threat of a peak in global oil supplies.', 'Azerbaijan was always expected to experience declining crude production in the 2010s, with the industry switching its focus there to big gas projects that would offset declining oil revenues. Gas deliveries from the Shah Deniz field are expected to reach Italy in October 2020 and the Absheron gas field is due on stream in the same year. The gas projects also bring some liquids production. The Shah Deniz field has been producing around 77,000 b/d of condensate in recent months.', 'While BP and others continue to explore, the IMF expects rising gas output to support modest rates of economic growth in Azerbaijan, amounting to 2.5% annually in the medium term, marred by what it recently called \u201cstructural rigidities, governance weaknesses, and lack of transparency.\u201d', 'KASHAGAN FLOWS', 'Kazakhstan at least has the advantage of rising oil production.

At a strategic level, there is evidence Russia retains significant control. Once-popular conceptions that a crude pipeline could be built across the Caspian to Azerbaijan to aid Kazakh oil exports now appear far-fetched. Kazakhstan remains heavily reliant on the CPC pipeline across southern Russia to the port of Novorossiisk.', 'And while international oil companies talk of controlling costs in the sector generally, that seems a forlorn hope in Kazakhstan, with dissatisfaction at rising costs extending beyond Tengiz.', 'Tensions at Tengiz burst into the open in June when more than 40 foreign workers were injured in an affray sparked by a foreign worker insulting a Kazakh co-worker. The Kazakh authorities were quick to blame their foreign partners for pay differences between Kazakh and foreign workers, and an alleged failure to hire more Kazakhs.', 'Chevron, in turn, has highlighted the non-standard aspects of the location, which has entailed, for example, building new dock facilities to bring in material for the expansion project.', 'KAZAKH UNCERTAINTY', 'Kazakhstan does appear to be taking steps to stimulate production at its numerous mature oil fields, with talk of tax breaks.

Wells in federal leases in the Delaware Basin accounted for about 350,000 b/d of new oil production since the start of 2018, about 14% of US production growth over that time, Kayrros said.', '\u201cThere is more than enough capacity in OPEC countries to make up for a drop in production growth on US Federal leases, so global oil supply is not substantially at stake,\u201d Kayrros said. \u201cIn the US itself, the potential for further production growth is obviously not limited to Federal leases, even if replacing these lands might entail venturing into less prolific private lands in New Mexico, Texas or elsewhere.\u201d', 'Oil output in New Mexico climbed to 956,000 b/d in September, up 555,000 b/d since September 2016, according to US Energy Information Administration data.

Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, for example, pledged in September to ban fracking and put a total moratorium on all new fossil fuel leases both on and offshore on her first day as president.', 'In an interview with the Platts Capitol Crude podcast, set to air Monday, Greg Priddy, Stratfor\u2019s director of global energy and Middle East, said the market was not pricing in risk of such an outcome since a full fracking ban or total moratorium was so unlikely.', '\u201cIt\u2019s so crazy, it can\u2019t happen,\u201d Priddy said.', 'If Warren or another Democrat with similar plans was elected such far reaching prohibitions on domestic output would likely be toned down by advisers or opposed by moderate Democrats in Congress, Priddy said.', '\\nSource: ', '\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t']"

The formation, dubbed Quesqui, is located onshore in Tabasco state, and is estimated to contain as much as 500 million barrels of crude. That\u2019s 280 days worth of output at Mexico\u2019s 1.8 million barrels of oil per day (bpd), worth an estimated $32.5 billion at current Brent crude price of $65.00 per barrel. That is, if Pemex can extract it all, which it normally won\u2019t.', 'The Mexican government yet to release a detailed breakdown of the reserve types, but Pemex is optimistic it will be producing 69,000 bpd of the new reserves in 2020. By 2021, the Mexican government anticipates output reaching 110,000 bpd from Tabasco, as well as 410 million cubic feet of natural gas per day.', 'The find comes as welcome news to the Mexican government which has seen Pemex\u2019s debt increase and oil output decline by half from 3.4 million bpd back in 2004.', 'Mexican President, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador (AMLO), acknowledged this grim reality, stating that Pemex was in \u201ca very bad state\u201d and is now \u201cbouncing back because there is no corruption and it is being managed very well.\u201d', 'But even this perceived success still warrants suspicion and, more importantly, skepticism. Pemex is the world\u2019s most indebted oil company \u2013 topping Venezuela\u2019s troubled PDVSA \u2013 owing more than $104 billion to creditors and shareholders. Moody\u2019s Investors Service gave Pemex a Baa3 rating \u2013 its lowest investment grade, and the S&P Global Ratings also has a negative outlook for Pemex, slashing its credit rating back in March.', 'But the state oil company still plays an undeniable energy policy role in Mexico. President Obrador has put his support behind Pemex, bolstering the company with capital injections and tax breaks. The company has also taken aggressive action of its own: in September Pemex sold $7.5 billion in in medium- and long-term bonds to refinance short-term debt.', 'To some degree these strategies are working. In later October, Pemex\u2019s Chief Financial Officer Alberto Velazquez, while on a conference call, said \u201cFor the first time in over a decade, the company\u2019s net debt was reduced,\u201d as it dropped by 6.1% to $99.6 billion.', 'These developments, however, come behind the backdrop of the recently negotiated United States Mexico Canada Agreement (USMCA), which appears to be moving forward after an agreement was reached with House Democrats. The Democratic-controlled House could vote to ratify the bill before the end of the year.', 'Jesus Seade, Mexican undersecretary to North America, and a top trade negotiator for Mexico, accused U.S. officials for allegedly blindsiding Mexico with a provision to designate labor monitors in the USMCA \u2013 which the country views as a violation of its sovereignty.', 'And while the Mexican economy is traditionally manufacturing-based \u2013 in 2018 60% of exports were vehicles, car parts and computers \u2013 crude oil constituted 7% of export revenues. Indeed, the US \u2013 Mexico energy relationship is a critical piece of the USMCA: Mexico accounts for 60% of US gasoline exports and 20% of its diesel sales. Mexico is also the largest buyer of US piped natural gas.', 'Though Mexico\u2019s energy sector \u2013 led by Pemex \u2013 is inching in the right direction, high debt burdens and uncertain UMCA conditions will prove major stumbling blocks. One would hope that the national oil company has the capital and capacity to economically (and meaningfully) produce oil from the Tabasco formation in the near term.', '\\nSource: Forbes']"

    "content": "['In keeping with what has become an annual tradition, we took out our handy crystal ball \u2013 manufactured from petroleum-based materials, of course \u2013 for a look at expectations for the year to come in 2020. What the crystal ball revealed is a mix of projected outcomes, some of which were entirely predictable, others not so much.', 'Here we go:', '\u2022 The domestic rig count will be largely stable, at least through the first six months of the year. Indeed, we saw what had been a steady fall during the final six months of 2019 become arrested during the past few weeks as companies drove completion of their year\u2019s drilling budgets and prepared the field to quickly execute on their budgets for the first half of the new year. The Enverus daily rig count actually added 33 newly-active rigs during the first two weeks of December, while the Baker Hughes weekly count also saw a slight rise. This trend will carry over into the new year, and we should see the situation remain relatively stable, at least until companies revise their budgets for the second half of next year.', '\\n\u2022 Bankruptcies involving small to mid-size producers will accelerate. As I wrote earlier this month, ongoing tight access to capital markets has created an upstream industry segment of \u201chaves\u201d and \u201chave-nots,\u201d with the smaller to mid-size producers mainly feeling the squeeze. This tightened access to capital will inevitably lead to more bankruptcy filings, and that in turn will inevitably lead to\u2026', '\\n\u2022 \u2026an increased level of mergers and acquisitions taking place during 2020. As with the rig count stabilizing, we have already seen this begin to take place during December, with several sizable transactions being announced, including WPX Energy\u2019s announcement of its $2.5 billion purchase of Felix Energy, a large operator in the prolific Delaware Basin region of the Greater Permian Basin. The service sector of the oil and gas business has also seen a series of mergers and acquisitions in recent weeks. Expect this level of activity to carry over into the new year. The \u201chaves\u201d will continue to have more in 2020 as the \u201chave-nots\u201d slowly fade from view.', '\\n\u2022 Commodity prices will remain range-bound in 2020. Simply put, the globe is awash in both oil and natural gas, a situation that will no change in the coming year. The price for West Texas Intermediate has broken above the $60 per barrel ceiling it experienced throughout most of 2019, but that is likely to be a short-lived phenomenon as the realities of the ongoing market over-supply will eventually dampen the current bullish market sentiment. Even less reason exists to expect any sustained improvement in the long-depressed natural gas price, although a sustained cold winter in North America could, if it materializes, provide relief for a few weeks.', '\\n\u2022 Shale production will just keep rising, despite all the fright media coverage predicting doom and gloom. The mix of producers will continue to evolve, as under-capitalized, highly-leveraged producers are merged into or acquired by larger, more integrated companies. That will happen because that is what market forces are demanding, and there is currently no one in government at any level willing or able to intervene to disrupt the market dynamics. That could all change in 2021 should an interventionist like Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders manage to win the presidency, but for 2020, the markets will rule.', '\\n\u2022 U.S. exports of both oil and natural gas in the form of LNG will continue to escalate. The EIA estimated the U.S. became a next exporter of oil for the first time in 70 years in September of this year, and we can expect more of the same in 2020 as production and export capacity at various Gulf Coast port facilities continue to rise.', '\\n\u2022 Finally, and happiest of all, events in the Middle East, such as September\u2019s missile attacks by Iran on Saudi oil infrastructure, will continue to have little if any real impact on oil prices. This shift in U.S. strategic interests in that unstable part of the world is a true, tangible gift to U.S. national security delivered by the shale revolution.', 'When President Donald Trump recently announced that he will soon withdraw another 4,000 U.S. military personnel from the 18-year-long quagmire in Afghanistan, Defense Secretary Mark Esper said the withdrawal can and will take place \u201cwith or without\u201d a peace agreement in place with the Taliban. \u201cI would like to go to a lower number because I want to either bring those troops home\u201d to retrain for new missions or to \u201cbe redeployed to the Indo-Pacific to face off our greatest challenge in terms of the great power competition \u2013 that\u2019s vis-a-vis China\u201d, he said.', 'This shift in America\u2019s compelling national interest in remaining involved in various intractable conflicts in the Middle East region is the direct result of the country\u2019s enhanced energy security brought about by the industry\u2019s ability to extract massive volumes of oil and natural gas from shale.

About US$35 billion of new development expenditure and 4.6 billion barrels of oil equivalent (boe) of resource could be sanctioned in 2020, compared to only US$5.5 billion and 1.2 billion boe of new projects getting the go-ahead in 2019.', 'After a dearth of project sanctions in the last few years, Australian project final investment decisions (FIDs) are now back on the cards in 2020.', 'Wood Mackenzie senior analyst David Low said: \u201cBarossa is closest to the line as new operator Santos looks to backfill the Darwin LNG plant. We expect Woodside to sanction Scarborough to underpin the Pluto Train 2 expansion, and Shell is set to take FID on the Crux field to backfill the Prelude FLNG facility.\u201d', 'Research director Andrew Harwood added: \u201cIn Q1 2020, PETRONAS will be looking to develop its deepwater expertise close to home through Limbayong, offshore Sabah, and the Kelidang Cluster, offshore Brunei. Given its deepwater ambitions in Mexico and Brazil, the national oil company (NOC) will be keen to demonstrate proficiency in bringing similar domestic projects online.\u201d', 'Exploration: Wildcats out, brownfields in?', '\\nAfter a record year for Asia Pacific exploration in 2019, attention is expected to switch to delineating some of the key discoveries over the last 12 months. Appraisal drilling at Repsol\u2019s Kali Berau Dalam, Eni\u2019s Ken Bau, PTTEP\u2019s Lang Lebah, and CNOOC\u2019s Yongle 8-3 will prove up commerciality ahead of development planning.', 'The outlook for pure wildcat exploration looks more limited in 2020. But there are still some potential play-openers in New Zealand\u2019s Great South Basin, deepwater Myanmar, offshore North Sumatra and offshore Papua. ', 'In Australia, it will be a pivotal year for the Beetaloo and McArthur Basins, long thought to hold significant resource potential, that could be the saviour of the Australian east coast gas market. ', '\u201cThis could be the breakout year when we find out if all the hype is justified. Origin, Santos and Empire Energy are hoping to get a better understanding of the rock mechanics and well deliverability with their exploration programmes in 2020. Flowrates above 5 million cubic feet per day (mmcfd) would be considered a success,\u201d added Low.', 'The cooldown in Asia exploration activity in the last few years reflects a global shift in resource capture strategies, with greater emphasis on getting more from existing fields.', 'Harwood said: \u201cIn 2020, we expect a growing focus on improving recovery rates by NOCs and smaller specialist players. PERTAMINA will hope to slow declines at Offshore Mahakam via an ambitious drilling campaign and new well and platform designs. PTTEP aims to recover more contingent resources from G1/61 (Erawan) and to lower development costs through synergies with its nearby assets.\u201d', 'M&A opportunities aplenty', '\\nThe pipeline of assets for sale remains strong. The Majors alone hold US$18 billion worth of non-core assets in Asia Pacific. Divesting late-life assets, low-return, pre-FID projects and positions with limited growth potential will be priority. Chevron\u2019s Indonesia Deepwater Development and Repsol\u2019s PM3 CAA are two examples of key assets expected to change hands over the next 12 months.', 'In Australia, LNG related deals will once again make headlines in 2020. Santos\u2019 2019 acquisition of ConocoPhillips\u2019 northern Australia portfolio is the catalyst for further M&A to align equity interests. SK E&S, part of the Barossa JV, is in line to move first and acquire 25% of Santos\u2019 stake in Darwin LNG and Bayu-Undan. Likewise, the Japanese participants in Darwin LNG are also expected to farm into the Barossa JV.', 'Upstream industry finds its way in energy transition', '\\nUntil recently, national energy needs have usually trumped environmental concerns when it comes to upstream development decisions. However, awareness of the energy transition has accelerated across the industry, with environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria increasingly influencing company strategy and investor behaviour.', '2020 could well see more Asia Pacific asset divestments as international oil companies seek to reduce carbon-intensive assets. Projects that do go-ahead will place more emphasis on carbon capture during development, and in some cases, the use of renewables to power upstream operations.', 'Low said: \u201cAustralian players have already started or are exploring carbon capture and storage and the use of renewables in upstream operations. As momentum grows in 2020 behind \u2018green LNG\u2019 as a buyer option, Australian operators will need to demonstrate they are making tangible progress in reducing their own carbon footprints.\u201d', 'As the global upstream industry plots a more sustainable future, Asian NOCs will also need to make a stand in 2020.', 'Harwood added: \u201cPETRONAS\u2019 giant 7 tcf Kasawari gas field offshore Sarawak is one of the flagship projects to watch. Sanctioned in 2019, we foresee PETRONAS abandoning previous plans to vent the field\u2019s 20%+ CO2, in favour of a more ambitious capture and sequestration solution.\u201d', 'IMO 2020 impact extends to Southeast Asian gas producers', '\\nKicking in from 1 January 2020, the impact of new IMO regulations governing sulphur content in marine fuels will be far-reaching. Lower demand and thus lower prices for high-sulphur fuel oil (HSFO) will have a direct impact on regional upstream cashflows. Most gas supplied from Peninsular Malaysia, the West Natuna Sea and South Sumatra is priced with a linkage to HSFO.', 'Over 2,500 mmcfd of gas production is exposed. Some of the most exposed operators include PETRONAS, ExxonMobil, Hess, PTTEP and Medco Energi.', 'Ultimately, the IMO impact on revenues may be neutralised by higher offtake levels \u2013 lower HSFO-linked prices will boost the competitiveness of pipeline suppliers, which have faced pressure from cheap LNG in recent months.', '\\nSource: Wood Mackenzie']"

Since mid-November 2018, when the recent US rig count peak totaled 1,237, industry has lost 30% or nearly 400 rigs.', 'Moreover, \u201cthe industry is still in search for the bottom of the US land rig count,\u201d investment bank Evercore ISI said last week in its annual Global E&P Spending Outlook for 2020.', 'This week\u2019s land rig count totaled 831, up by four but down from 1,144 this same week in 2018, Enverus\u2019 data show.', 'Evercore is forecasting the US land rig count to fall 10% in 2020 year on year, which is greater than its US capex spending forecast decline of 7% for next year.', 'The rig count gains are likely traceable to year-end drilling here and there as needed, possibly fueled by higher oil prices that finally mounted the $60/b milestone not seen in months, observers said.', '\u2018LAST-MINUTE PORTFOLIO CLEANUPS\u2019', '\u201cIt\u2019s a bit premature to talk of a sustained rebound yet, but there was a year-end increase in vertical oil drilling which suggests some private operators are doing some last-minute portfolio cleanups that they\u2019ve budgeted,\u201d Enverus drilling analyst Bob Williams said.', 'The heightened activity \u201cmight even have been conditioned on\u201d higher oil prices this last week in 2020 \u2013 the first time NYMEX crude was above $60/b since mid-July, Williams said.', '\u201cI think we\u2019re headed for a period of relative oil price stability while consolidation continues in the industry,\u201d he said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean the consolidation won\u2019t continue, just that the rig count may have bottomed out.\u201d', 'This week\u2019s total rig count gains came from oil-directed rigs, which moved up 10 to 695. Conversely, natural gas-oriented rigs moved down six to 160. In addition, a one rig rise came from basins classified as neither oil nor gas.', 'As a result, drilling ticked up in two of the largest domestic oil basins \u2014 the Permian in West Texas/New Mexico, and Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas as each added several rigs.', 'The biggest boost came from the Eagle Ford, which rose by four rigs to 77 week on week while the Permian was up three to 404.

The biggest change was in the DJ Basin, down 71 this week to four, while the Eagle Ford was down 28 permits to total 60 and the Haynesville was down 22 to 10.', 'But the Permian was up 25 permits to 208 and the Dry Marcellus was up 17 permits to 24. Other named basins were up or down by less than 10 permits.', 'The period from late November through year end typically sees activity slowdowns as holiday vacations and exhausted capital budgets translate to flattish rig counts. Experts don\u2019t predict a great surge of drilling in the New Year, as by all accounts US capex should be down anywhere from 7% to upward of 10%.', 'That largely stems not only from oil price volatility where WTI prices, now slightly over $61/b, had dipped to the low $50s/b in October. Uncertainty on that front, as well as pressure from investors has resulted in an unprecedented commitment to capital discipline in the last couple of years, even with slightly higher oil prices this month than a few months ago.', 'Both oil and gas prices were up this week. WTI averaged $60.27/b for the current week, up $1.34, while WTI Midland price averaged $61.33/b, up $1.26 and the Bakken Composite price was $54.56/b, up $1.23.', 'For gas, Henry Hub price averaged $2.28/MMBtu, up 5 cents, while the price at Dominion South was $1.92/MMBtu, up 13 cents.', 'From early indications, oil executives appear set to continue a general program austerity in 2020 that focuses more on returning cash to shareholders, increasing cash flows and paying down debt than pushing dollars toward more wells and growing production.', 'On Monday, the US Energy Information Administration, in its latest monthly report that tracks monthly shale growth, projected domestic shale oil to grow by 30,000 b/d in January 2020 over December 2019 to nearly 9.14 million, a new record.', 'That said, the spectacular year-on-year shale growth appears of recent years to have stalled.

However, Saudi Arabia announced to continue to over-comply by 400,000 barrels, which brings the actual but unofficial agreement to above two million bpd production cut.', '\u201cThat gave oil markets extra support,\u201d said ABN AMRO\u2019s van Cleef.', 'Over the longer term, demand growth for natural gas will exceed that of crude oil, given that the latter is the cleaner burning hydrocarbon.', 'Like any other commodity, demand for crude oil will be affected by a prolonged trade war between the US and China, which will, in turn, dampen global economic growth, said RAM Rating Services Bhd (RAM Ratings) head of corporate ratings Thong Mun Wai.', '\u201cWe expect Brent crude to average US$55-US$60 per barrel in 2020, down from an average of US$65 per barrel in the first nine months of 2019, in view of a slightly oversupplied market next year,\u201d he told Bernama.', 'Meanwhile, production levels of OPEC+ to remain status quo as long as the demand and supply remain fairly balanced but should crude oil prices fall significantly from current levels, OPEC+ may be forced to act.', 'SAUDI ARABIA\u2019S CROWN JEWEL', 'Charging towards the listing date on Dec 11, the Saudi government claimed state-owned oil company Aramco is worth US$2 trillion as it aimed to raise proceeds for economic reforms and diversify the Saudi economy away from oil, but banks begged to differ, putting the valuation closer to US$1.5 trillion.', 'Shares in Saudi Aramco surged on the second day of trading with its market capitalisation hitting the US$2 trillion mark.', '\u201cPeople underestimate the fact that a single entity controls Saudi Arabia oil, and that\u2019s the Saudi royal family, making them the most influential individual body on oil prices.', '\u201cBut that alone can\u2019t hold up as the initial public offering (IPO) will have less influence on markets amid the growing backlash against fossil fuels, and escalation of regional political tensions are creating less interest from western investors,\u201d AxiTrade chief Asia market strategist Stephen Innes told Bernama.', 'Albeit its record-shattering listing, Aramco would face several challenges including its large footprint in the industry that leaves it particularly vulnerable to a mass movement towards sustainable energy, while oil demand will start to contract as early as 2035.', 'Van Cleef of ABN AMRO said that there would hardly be an impact to the oil market as Saudi Arabia would most likely try to prevent a rapid decline in oil prices in the near-term post-listing.', '\u201cBesides that, I do not see a direct link between the IPO and the oil price,\u201d he added.   ', 'OIL TUSSLE IN OUR OWN BACKYARD', 'Domestically, in November, what started off as diplomatic discussions over the Sarawak state\u2019s share of oil revenue under the broader Malaysian Agreement 1963 escalated into a lawsuit by the state government, which is claiming unpaid sales tax from national oil firm Petronas, reported to be RM1.29 billion for the first six months of the year.', 'Petronas is said to be an oil and gas company operating in Sarawak that has not paid the sales tax.', 'Its president and chief executive officer Tan Sri Wan Zulkiflee Wan Ariffin was reportedly as saying that increasing the oil royalty paid to oil and gas producing states to 20% is not possible as production costs are high and profit margins low.', 'RAM Ratings\u2019 Thong believed that it is in the best interest for Petronas and the Sarawak government to resolve amicably their dispute over the sales tax levied on petroleum products in the state.', '\u201cUltimately, the Federal Government has to make the decision, which will need to balance its fiscal requirements and Petronas\u2019 financial viability with the need to allow Sarawak to have a greater share of petroleum revenue to fund development in the state,\u201d he added.', 'However, given the complexity of this balancing act, it will not be surprising if the issue takes a longer time to resolve, said Thong.', 'Meanwhile, the government is considering selling stakes in Petronas to states where the company\u2019s oil and gas fields are located, in a bid to raise funds for the government\u2019s coffers.', 'The move may give states such as Sabah and Sarawak a say in running Petronas, the world\u2019s third-largest exporter of LNG.', '\\nSource: Bernama']"

    "content": "['The U.S. oil industry shook up the world energy order in the last decade, and now it has been going through a shakeout of its own that is expected to end in more bankruptcies and mergers.', 'In the early part of this century, an upstart band of U.S. energy producers brought hydraulic fracturing, or \u201cfracking,\u201d technology to the world. It was an American-born innovation that helped turn the U.S. from the world\u2019s biggest importer of oil into, just recently, a net exporter of oil and fuel products.', 'In the last decade, U.S. oil production boomed as producers used hydraulic fracturing and evolving horizontal drilling technology to extract oil from difficult-to-access places and some fields that had previously been considered nearly tapped out. The U.S. is now producing just under 13 million barrels a day and has become the world\u2019s largest oil producer.', 'With their growing success, American drillers were able to find ready debt financing as investors were willing to gamble on the idea that wells could start producing in a fraction of the time it took more conventional drillers. That helped drive an oil glut, and global prices suffered from oversupply. The imbalance is improving, but now there are questions about how fast demand will grow.', 'Investors have lost patience with the industry\u2019s boom-to-bust cycles. As a result, energy stocks have been among the worst performers of the decade, up just 4%, and energy debt is among the least desirable.', '\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a hatchet taken to these companies in the next year,\u201d said John Kilduff, partner with Again Capital. \u201cThere will be bankruptcies and consolidation. The party is over.\u201d', 'Market disruption', '\\nThe growth of U.S. shale created a boom-town atmosphere in the places where drilling was growing most \u2014 West Texas and North Dakota. But it also disrupted the entire world oil market.', 'In what would have been unheard of a decade ago, Saudi Arabia and OPEC forged a deal with Russia and other non-OPEC producers to control their production to support oil prices. The recent extension of this three-year-old pact has helped steady prices.', 'Unlike many of those producers, the U.S. industry is untethered, with no government deciding production levels, and its only constraints are economic and financial. That has made life hard for U.S. drillers this year, with oil prices below their break-even level much of the year. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were at $60.81 per barrel Tuesday.', '\u201cWe\u2019re at the early stages [of the shakeout]. The problem is some of these companies still have a bit of rope to go,\u201d said Ken Monaghan, Amundi Pioneer co-director of high yield. \u201cThey don\u2019t have [debt] maturities that are coming up in 2020 and 2021. They\u2019re going to try to outrun the clock and hope that oil prices move higher.\u201d', 'Daniel Yergin, who has authored books on the evolution of the oil industry, said the U.S. industry is likely to morph now, as the industry hits an inflection point. The oil majors, such as ExxonMobil and Chevron, were slow to join the shale boom. But now they and the biggest oil independents will increasingly dominate the industry over the core of small independents and mom-and-pop oil drillers that launched the industry.', 'Both Exxon and Chevron have announced aggressive expansion plans for the Permian Basin, the hottest shale play covering a 75,000-square-mile area that runs through West Texas and southeastern New Mexico.', '\u201cIt\u2019s clearly a new era for shale. The irony is the U.S. is heading for these unimagined levels of production,\u201d said Yergin, vice chairman of IHS Markit. \u201cThe U.S. industry is the world\u2019s No. 1 oil producer, and it\u2019s a major exporter, but the financial markets are giving them no credit for that anymore. The stocks were actually more highly valued when the oil price was in collapse than they are now. \u2026 Investors and producers have to work out a new social contract.\u201d', 'The market-imposed discipline on energy companies is not new, but analysts see it taking a new turn, with more mergers and more debt restructurings needed for the industry to emerge in healthier shape.', '\u201cMost people are saying we don\u2019t want you to spend money on growth. We want you to give the money back because you guys are dummies,\u201d said Michael Bradley, energy strategist with Tudor, Pickering, Holt. \u201cPeople want a return on capital. [Oil] prices today are higher than they were a year ago at this time, but cap ex is lower.\u201d', 'With the new discipline is coming slower production growth. Analysts said part of the reason U.S. production has grown so quickly is that the payback on shale wells is much faster than conventional wells and, particularly, offshore platforms where development can take years.', 'According to Citigroup energy analyst Eric Lee, U.S. oil production\u2019s rapid growth ramped up to 2 million barrels a day year over year in August alone. In the past week, oil production totaled 12.8 million barrels a day, up 1.2 million barrels from a year ago, according to weekly government data.', 'Over the past 10 years, U.S. oil production more than doubled, rising by more than 7 million barrels a day since January 2010, when it was just 5.4 million barrels per day.', '\u201cThat\u2019s what they\u2019ve wildly been doing for the last 10 years,\u201d said Lee. \u201cThe first crash happened because the world didn\u2019t need as much as was being produced.\u201d As more U.S. oil came onto the world market, oil prices fell hard in 2014 and then bottomed in 2016, at under $30 a barrel.', 'Lee said Citi analysts expect U.S. oil production to reach nearly 16 million barrels of crude by 2023. Analysts say the price of oil will be a big determinant in how quickly U.S. output will grow and at what level it will peak.', 'Mergers and a debt bomb', '\\nEnergy has been the worst-performing sector in the stock market this year, as well as in the high-yield debt market.', 'For the year to date, the XLE, the Energy Select Sector SPDR ETF, is up just 5%, compared with the 29% gain in West Texas Intermediate crude futures and the 27% gain in the S&P 500.', 'The energy index of the high-yield market has a face value of $170 billion and a market value of $150 billion, according to Amundi.', '\u201cThere\u2019s more distressed energy names than there are in any other sector,\u201d said Monaghan. \u201cUp until this month, energy bonds in the high yield index had lost money for the year-to-date, and now they\u2019re in positive territory only in the month of December because there\u2019s been a little higher [oil] prices.\u201d', 'Bradley said he expects that about $30 billion to $40 billion of high-yield energy debt is at risk. He and other analysts said some companies will have no choice but to seek bankruptcy protection and restructure.', '\u201cWeatherford went through bankruptcy,\u201d said Bradley. \u201cThey\u2019re coming through it. That\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d', 'Once the fourth-largest oil services company, Weatherford emerged from bankruptcy on Friday after selling $6 billion in assets and receiving $10 billion in support from bondholders, according to the Houston Chronicle. Those bondholders now control 94% of the company.', 'Some companies remain poorly capitalized, and the very nature of shale is one of the reasons.', 'The shale industry needs to keep drilling to keep its production rate high because of the rapid depletion of its wells in the first year alone. According to IHS, young shale wells can decline at a rate of about 70% to 75% in the first year, so companies continue to drill more wells. If they stopped drilling, production would be down by as much as 35% a year later, according to IHS.', '\u201cIf you look at the problem with the sector itself, which is the significant depletion of the reserve over a briefer time than used to be the norm, you better have capital and balance sheet structures that better match that probability,\u201d Monaghan said.', 'Some of these issues could be fixed in mergers, which have challenges of their own. \u201cIt\u2019s often hard to create a merger when you have two companies or three companies that are in the walking wounded category,\u201d said Monaghan.', '\u201cThe issue then becomes the acquisition currency. It\u2019s not easy to execute on. Then you have a management team that\u2019s probably hoping and praying oil prices will move a little higher.\u201d', 'Bradley said the merger this week between WPX Energy and private company Felix may be a sign of things to come for the sector, since Felix did not garner much of a premium. WPX shares gained after the transaction was announced and were up 16% on the week.', '\u201cThis is the first deal I\u2019ve seen in a long time where the stock was up,\u201d said Bradley.', 'He expects to see more mergers in the mid-cap sector. \u201cAnything between $2 [billion and] $7 billion is going, in the next two years, to be gobbled up,\u201d Bradley said. He said companies such as Concho Resources and Diamondback Energy could be the larger independents, which he says would have a market cap of about $15 billion to $25 billion.', 'Bradley said it\u2019s clear the majors are growing market share in shale, since they have not shut down wells while others have.', 'Lee said the majors now make up about 15% of shale production and are growing. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of little guys,\u201d said Lee. He said private companies continue to be a big chunk of Permian production, with about 45%.', 'Ultimately, analysts expect the industry to end up in better financial shape.', '\u201cTheoretically, this doesn\u2019t bode well for the consumer,\u201d said Kilduff. \u201cConsolidation and mergers should bring in a much higher level of production discipline, which should mean less supply for the market and higher prices.\u201d', '\\nSource: CNBC']"

For the key area Buzios, the bonus was offered at US$17bn. There were also rather complicated terms for negotiating compensation in the co-participation agreement with new partners that indicated that Petrobras has to be compensated for recovering less cashflow upfront from its original contract in Buzios. All this resulted in favor of Petrobras, and after all, the company had a big incentive in winning control of an area that it originally de-risked and started developing.', '\u201cNow the bulk of the capital investment needed to develop Buzios will come from Petrobras and the company\u2019s recently announced five-year strategy confirms this additional investment in pre-salt areas. The oil company plans to spend US$75.7bn during this period of which almost 60% will go to pre-salt and 28% will be allocated only to Buzios', '\u201cFrom Petrobras\u2019 perspective it made sense to establish a high entry price for any company wanting to enter into a project with low risk and a huge cash flow upside.

For the kingdom, it was an unprecedented move. Even so, the price of oil briefly dropped to close to $55 a barrel in August, below the $60 to $70 a barrel range that was needed to support the IPO, Bloomberg underlined.', 'This made Al-Rumayyan move even faster. He was convinced; time was running out and that the IPO needed to be fast tracked.
