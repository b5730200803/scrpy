    "content": "['Equinor reports adjusted earnings of USD 3.55 billion and USD 1.19 billion after tax in the fourth quarter of 2019. IFRS net operating income was USD 1.52 billion and the IFRS net income was negative USD 0.23 billion, following net impairments of USD 1.41 billion.', 'The fourth quarter and full year were characterised by:', ' Solid financial results in a quarter with lower commodity prices', 'n Strong operational performance in 2019, and record high production in the fourth quarter', 'n Early start-up and effective ramp up of Johan Sverdrup. New projects on stream in 2019 represent 1.2 billion boe in expected resources net to Equinor, at an average break-even oil price around USD 30 per barrel', 'n Renewables projects in development in 2019 are expected to add 2.8 GW of electricity capacity to Equinor', 'n Strong growth in capital distribution in 2019, reflecting 13% growth in quarterly cash dividend and the launch of a USD 5 billion share buy-back programme', 'n Increase in quarterly cash dividend by 4% to USD 0.27 per share, and launch of an around USD 675 million second tranche of the share buy-back programme, subject to approvals by the annual general meeting', 'Record high production, reduced costs and continued strong capital discipline contributed to solid results in a quarter with lower commodity prices. For the year we delivered competitive returns and strong growth in capital distribution. Going forward, we expect to grow production, returns and cash flow from a world-class project portfolio, representing 6 billion barrels to Equinor with an average break-even oil price below 35 dollars per barrel. The board proposes an increase in the quarterly dividend of 4% and the launch of the second tranche of our 5 billion dollar share buy-back programme, based on an even distribution for the rest of the period, says Eldar Stre, President and CEO of Equinor ASA.', 'We started production at Johan Sverdrup in October last year, ahead of schedule and more than 30% below the original cost estimate. We expect the entire phase 1 investment to be paid back already by the end of this year, less than 15 months after the first well was put in production, says Stre.', '2019 was truly a game-changing year for our renewables business. We made the investment decision for Hywind Tampen in Norway and won the opportunities to develop Empire Wind offshore New York and Dogger Bank, the worlds largest offshore wind development, in the UK. Renewables projects in development will add 2.8 gigawatts of electricity capacity to Equinor, more than five-fold our current capacity, says Stre.', 'Adjusted earnings [5] were USD 3.55 billion in the fourth quarter, down from USD 4.39 billion in the same period in 2018. Adjusted earnings after tax [5] were USD 1.19 billion, down from USD 1.54 billion in the same period last year. Lower prices for both liquids and gas impacted the earnings for the quarter.', 'Adjusted operating costs and administrative expenses were down 8% from the same quarter last year. The Marketing, Midstream and Processing segment reported strong trading results and obtained high prices in a challenging market. Results in the E&P International segment were impacted by low US gas prices, higher field development costs and higher than normal expensing of previously capitalised exploration costs.', 'IFRS net operating income was USD 1.52 billion in the fourth quarter, down from USD 6.75 billion in the same period of 2018. IFRS net income was negative USD 0.23 billion in the fourth quarter, down from positive USD 3.37 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018. Net operating income was impacted by net impairment charges of USD 1.41 billion, of which USD 1.28 billion relates to assets on the Norwegian continental shelf, mainly as a result of change in method for including tax uplift in impairment evaluations.', 'For the full year, adjusted earnings [5] were USD 13.5 billion, down from USD 18.0 billion in 2018. IFRS net income was USD 1.85 billion, down from USD 7.54 billion in 2018.', 'Equinor delivered record high total equity production of 2,198 mboe per day in the fourth quarter, up 1% from the same period in 2018. The flexibility in the gas fields was used to defer production into periods with higher expected gas prices. Successful start-up and ramp-up of new fields as well as new well capacity, contributed to growth in production. The Johan Sverdrup field was put in production 5 October 2019 and is currently producing more than 350.000 barrels per day from eight wells. The field is expected to reach plateau during the summer of 2020.', 'As of the end of fourth quarter 2019, Equinor has completed 42 exploration wells with 18 commercial discoveries. Adjusted exploration expenses in the quarter were USD 0.44 billion, compared to USD 0.42 billion in the same quarter of 2018.', 'The organic proved reserve replacement ratio (RRR) was 83%, with a three-year average of 140%. With 6 billion barrels in proved reserves, Equinors reserves to production ratio (R/P) was 8.6 years.', 'Cash flows provided by operating activities before taxes paid and changes in working capital amounted to USD 21.8 billion in 2019, compared to USD 27.6 billion in 2018. Organic capital expenditure [5] was USD 10.0 billion for 2019. At year end, net debt to capital employed was 23.8%. Increased oil volumes in transit to capture higher value and accelerated tax payments in Norway impacted the net debt ratio with an increase of around two percentage points. Following the implementation of IFRS 16, net debt to capital employed1 was 29.5%.', 'The board of directors proposes to the annual general meeting to increase the dividend by 4% to USD 0.27 per share for the fourth quarter. Equinor is on track with executing its share buy-back programme of up to USD 5 billion over a period until the end of 2022, and will launch a second tranche of USD 225 million in the market, corresponding to around USD 675 million including the Norwegian State share, from around 18 May to 28 October 2020, subject to renewal of authorisation to execute share buy-backs at the annual general meeting.', 'Average CO2-emissions from Equinors operated upstream production, on a 100% basis, was 9.5 kg per barrel in 2019.', 'The twelve-month average Serious Incident Frequency (SIF) was 0.6 for 2019, compared to 0.5 in 2018. The twelve-month average Total Recordable Injury Frequency (TRIF) was 2.5 for 2019, compared to 2.8 in 2018.', 'nToday, Equinor presents its update to the capital markets, focusing on key deliveries:', ' Growing production, cash flow and returns:', ' Expecting around 7% production growth in 2020 and to deliver an average annual production growth of around 3% from 2019 to 2026', 'n Capacity to generate around USD 30 billion in organic cash flow2 from 2020 to 2023, after taxes and organic investments, and around 15% return on average capital employed (ROACE) [5] in 2023, at an assumed oil price of USD 65 per barrel', ' Driving long term value creation in line with the Paris Agreement. Equinor aims to:', ' Strengthen its industry leading position on carbon efficient production, aiming to reach carbon neutral global operations by 2030', 'n Grow profitably within renewables, developing as a global offshore wind major', 'n Reduce the net carbon intensity, from initial production to final consumption, of energy produced by at least 50% by 2050', 'Equinor is already delivering competitive returns, and we expect to grow production, returns and cash flow going forward. We are investing in a world class project portfolio coming on stream towards 2026, representing 6 billion barrels to Equinor with an average break-even oil price below 35 dollars per barrel. In addition, Johan Sverdrup phase 1 will contribute to strong growth at the Norwegian continental shelf. High quality projects like Bay du Nord in Canada, Rosebank in the UK and BM-C-33 and Bacalhau in Brazil will deliver high profitable growth internationally, says Stre.', 'During the last few years, Equinor has substantially strengthened its competitiveness and improved its project portfolio. Equinor is today increasing its ambition, aiming to achieve improvements with a cash flow effect of more than USD 3 billion from 2020 to 2025 through digital solutions and new ways of working. Equinor delivered industry leading unit production cost of USD 5.3 per barrel in 2019, and is targeting a 5% improvement towards 2021.', 'The ambition to reduce net carbon intensity by at least 50% by 2050 takes into account scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, from initial production to final consumption. By 2050 each unit of energy produced will, on average, have less than half of the emissions compared to today. The ambition is expected to be met primarily through significant growth in renewables and changes in the scale and composition of the oil and gas portfolio. Operational efficiency, CCUS and hydrogen will also be important, and recognised offset mechanisms and natural sinks may be used as a supplement3.', 'In 2026, Equinor expects a production capacity from renewable projects of 4 to 6 GW, Equinor share, mainly based on the current project portfolio. This is around 10 times higher than todays capacity, implying an annual average growth rate of more than 30%. Towards 2035, Equinor expects to increase installed renewables capacity further to 12 to 16 GW, dependent on availability of attractive project opportunities. Equinor expects to achieve unlevered real project returns of 6 to 10% and can achieve significantly higher return on equity investments through portfolio optimisation and efficient use of project financing.', 'Today we are setting new short-, mid- and long-term ambitions to reduce our own greenhouse gas emissions and to shape our portfolio in line with the Paris Agreement. It is a good business strategy to ensure competitiveness and drive change towards a low carbon future, based on a strong commitment to value creation for our shareholders, says Stre.', 'Equinors strategic direction is clear. We are developing as a broad energy company, leveraging the strong synergies between oil, gas, renewables, CCUS and hydrogen. We will continue addressing our own emissions in line with the emitter pays principle. But, we can and will do more. As part of the energy industry, we must be part of the solution to combat climate change and address decarbonisation more broadly, in line with changes in society, says Stre.', 'Finally, Equinor announces its updated outlook:', ' Equinor expects average annual organic capex [5] of USD 10-11 billion in 2020 and 2021, and around USD 12 billion for 2022 and 2023', 'n Equinor expects to deliver around 7% growth in production in 2020, and an average annual production growth of around 3% from 2019 to 2026 [7]n Equinor expects exploration activity of around USD 1.4 billion in 20204', 'n', 'n', 'n', 'n', 'Source: Equinor']"

Its Permian Basin production rose more than 100,000 barrels per day in the last year.', 'We continue to ramp up our production from our core acreage, Gerges said.', 'Shell and rival oil majors Exxon Mobil, Chevron and BP are spending billions in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico. The companies see shale as a short-cycle asset that complements projects such as deepwater wells that take years to bring into production.', 'The Permian has 30 years of so-called tier one high quality drilling inventory and will remain at the heart of U.S. oil growth, Gerges said. But the industry faces challenges in the region, ranging from too much natural gas flaring to inadequate infrastructure and even todays investor sentiments, he said.', 'Previously, Shell indicated it might seek a way to expand its presence in the Permian, but during last weeks earnings call, Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden indicated the timing is not right for an acquisition.', 'I think anything inorganic would not be the right thing to do, van Beurden said.', 'Oil and gas companies of all sizes have been under pressure to produce more free cash and return it to investors through share buybacks and dividends.', 'The industry also faces pressures to reduce emissions, especially from prolific gas flaring, deliberately burning gas produced as a byproduct to oil. The practice can worsen climate change by releasing carbon dioxide.', 'The U.S. drilling industry flared or vented more natural gas in 2019 for the third year in a row, as soaring production in Texas, New Mexico, and North Dakota have overwhelmed regulatory efforts to curb the practice, according to state data and independent research estimates.', 'The flaring and emissions in the Permian Basin have become famous and its not something we would like to be recognized for, Gerges said.', 'The region needs more infrastructure such as natural gas pipelines, but it is more important to have robust, fit-for-purpose policies and regulatory requirements that incentivize reduction in flaring, Gerges said.', 'nSource: Reuters (Reporting by Jennifer Hiller in Houston Editing by Bernadette Baum and David Gregorio)']"

    "title": "Coronavirus Sends Oil Prices Plummeting: 5 Key Questions Answered",
    "content": "['1.tWhy are fears over Coronavirus causing the price of oil to fall? China has undertaken significant quarantine measures that include shutting down all public transportation in the province where the outbreak is centered. Outside of that region, the Chinese government has ordered all businesses remain closed through February 10. People across China are staying home rather than traveling, which is cutting demand for transportation fuels and reducing the fuel and electricity demands for industrial output. China is also the worlds largest oil importer. In December 2019, China imported a total of 10.78 million barrels of oil per day, which is about 10% of total global oil production. According to reports from Bloomberg, Chinese oil demand may have already dropped by as much as 3 million barrels per day. Unipec, the trading arm of Chinese refiner Sinopec, is reported to have stopped buying cargoes of crude from West Africa and is looking resell some Angolan crude that it was preparing to import into China in March. These reports are sparking fear in the oil market, causing further price drops.', 'n2.tWill the impact on the oil market outlast the virus outbreak? If the outbreak is severe enough, we could see a recession that will take on its own life. For example, we are seeing a drop in jet fuel demand as airlines suspend routes to and from China. On top of that, with businesspeople unable to travel, business connections between China and the rest of the world may suffer long-term consequences. We could see delays in opening factories or other businesses in China. There are growing anxieties over global economic growth in 2020 and even fears of a global recession. Declining global economic activity would lead to lower demand for oil.', 'n3.tCan Saudi Arabia or any other producer cut enough oil production to keep the price of the commodity from dropping? If a producer were to successfully do this, it would be Saudi Arabia, which is still best positioned to alter production on short notice. Saudi Arabia has been producing just under 10 million barrels per day, but it has the ability to ramp up production by at least 2 million barrels or to cut production significantly on very short notice. U.S. producers, on the other hand, cannot decrease production so easily for two reasons: 1) oil production is the business of dozens of firms in the U.S., so there is no centralized control to coordinate a joint production cut and such collusion would be an illegal antitrust violation in any case, and 2) the U.S. shale firms need to keep pumping to pay their bills and loans and to appease their investors. OPEC and its OPEC+ partners might cooperate with Saudi Arabia on a potential production cut to some extent, but historically the other countries in the cartel have looked to Saudi Arabia to make the biggest cuts in similar scenarios. Ultimately, Saudi Arabia can cut production, but it isnt clear if production cuts would stabilize oil prices as the market is more concerned with anxiety over demand than it is with supply.', 'n4.tIf oil drops enough due to the Coronavirus outbreak, what long-term impacts will the oil industry experience? In such a circumstance, the U.S. shale industry could suffer. Some shale producers need to see WTI prices at least around $50 or even $60 for their operations to be profitable. WTI fell below $50 for a time today, and it is flirting with prices that are unsustainably low for some shale producers. If it drops further and stays low, some firms will not be able to pay their bills and make payments on their debt. Firms will have difficulty accessing further financing. We could see a return of the problems faced in 2015 and 2016, when several shale firms collapsed because of low oil prices. Another problem for the greater oil industry would be that with less revenue, we would see less investment in exploration. Even the big international oil companies would be forced to reconsider investments in the future. Capital expenditures and exploration investment are already down in the last five years (although some companies like Exxon and Aramco are focusing more on the future), so any prolonged period of lower prices could see even more cuts to exploration. This could result in a drop in available reserves in the decades to come.', 'n5.tWill Coronavirus mean you pay less at the gas station? If oil prices stay low, you may see lower prices at the pump as well. Generally, gas prices do not drop immediately just because the price of oil drops for a day or two. However, the price of oil is falling fast. If it continues, you could see positive results for your wallet when filling your gas tank in the coming weeks. Note that if the economic impacts of Coronavirus are long-term and we see long-term lower oil prices, you might be celebrating the gas prices while the U.S. economy suffers for a wounded shale industry. Even the good news comes with some bad.', 'nSource: Forbes']"

Yet unlike many of its rivals that are starting to diversify away from their core activities, the largest oil major shows little sign of moving away from its reliance on oil and gas.', 'Companies such as Shell, Total, Equinor and Eni have set emissions reduction targets, while Spains Repsol has set a target to be net zero  including emissions from its customers use of its products  by 2050. This is, at the time of writing, an industry-leading ambition but it seems likely that others will join Repsol soon.', 'Repsol believes it can achieve two-thirds of the 2050 goal through initiatives such as moving away from carbon intensive projects, using cleaner forms of energy to power refineries, adding more biofuels into diesel and petrol, cutting flaring and methane leaks, and increasing renewable power in its energy mix.', 'One other way that it hopes to meet its goal is by increasing the use of digital technology. Innovation plays a crucial role in meeting this objective, said Clara Rey Garcia, head of Repsols corporate venturing team, at a recent seminar at the firms Madrid headquarters. Repsols 85m corporate venture fund promotes disruptive technologies such as robotization, big data, artificial intelligence and blockchain with the aim of transforming the energy sector, Garcia added.', 'Yet digitalization is an area that the oil and gas sector paid relatively little attention to for decades, said Geoffrey Cann, author of Bits, Bytes, and Barrels: The Digital Transformation of Oil and Gas at the seminar.', 'The oil and gas industry, like the rest of the economy, is generating increasing amounts of data, in part from the increasing application of the Internet of Things. This data is being analysed and interpreted using artificial intelligence and machine learning, and robots are putting the data to work.', 'This will create many efficiencies but one of the most important elements in the sector cleaning up its act will be the use of blockchain, Cann said. As the sector announces increasingly ambitious emissions reduction targets, it will come under growing pressure to prove that it is doing what it says it is. Blockchain is what creates trust across all those different elements, Cann asserted.', 'Thats because of its ability to track and record data in a way that is tamper-proof so there is no dispute about whether the data is correct, he added. Blockchain provides traceability along the length of the value chain.', 'Obviously, actions to achieve Repsols targets need to be measured and monitored, but the technology and tools to enable this are, relative to the scale of the problem, shallow. Data must be stored in a manner that leaves an evidence trail  it must be tamper-proof, auditable and transparent. That means that the global energy industry, still heavily analogue, must lead with digitalisation if we are to tackle the impact of climate change in a meaningful way, he stated.', 'One of the companies that Repsol backs, Finboot, helps companies in the oil and gas sector (as well as in retail and automotive) to integrate blockchain solutions into their operations and Juan Miguel Perez, CEO and co-founder, said that the technology will play a growing role as companies strive to meet their sustainability targets. Measuring goals is the key to progress. We need ways to prove our achievements, as well as to see our progress towards our targets, he said. It will become increasingly important as corporate sustainability efforts come under increasing scrutiny.', 'His co-founder Nish Kotecha added that in an era when money is flowing to companies that are data-rich and understand the value of that data, why would you give your money to a company whose data can be questioned?', 'Blockchain wont just help the oil and gas sector in its upstream operations  it can play a key role in energy trading, not just for the large companies but also for individual households looking to buy and sell renewable energy.', 'And outside the sector, it can be used to track waste, highlight inefficiencies in supply chains and how companies and countries are performing against their Paris Agreement targets, and even monitor endangered species.', 'As the world edges towards energy insecurity caused by the ongoing climate crisis as well as a battle for regional dominance in the Middle East, it is vital to think in more inventive ways and embrace new technologies to see how they can disrupt the status quo, Kotecha said. And if ever there was a disrupter that could manage it, its blockchain.', 'nSource: Forbes']"

    "content": "['Global oil demand will peak around 2040  or much sooner  the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said in a new report on the future of oil.', 'The IMF said that this could have a significant impact on oil-exporting countries, predominantly those in the Middle East whose existing financial wealth could be depleted in the next 15 years if major reforms arent undertaken.', 'Growth of global oil demand will significantly decelerate, and its level could peak in the next two decades, the IMF said in its report entitled, The Future of oil and fiscal sustainability in the GCC Region, published Thursday.', 'The IMF said analysis of past oil market developments revealed a strong and sustained declining trend in the global oil demand, after accounting for income and population growth.', 'This reflected a range of factors, the IMF said, such as long-term improvement in energy efficiency and substitution away from oil, trends that had so far been veiled by the effects of economic and population expansion.', 'But it is poised to become more visible in the coming years, resulting in a path of gradually slowingand eventually decliningglobal demand for oil. The latter would peak by around 2040 in our benchmark projection or much sooner in scenarios of stronger regulatory push for environmental protection and faster improvements in energy efficiency.', 'Growth of global demand for natural gas is also expected to slow, the Fund said, although it is expected to remain positive in the coming decades.', 'The IMF is not the first to make predictions about a decline in global oil demand. In late 2019, Neil Atkinson, head of the oil industry and markets division at the International Energy Agency, told CNBC that population growth remained the key driving force for oil demand, which he said could peak in the 2030s.', 'If we have a much more business-as-usual (approach) with much more limited (environmental) policy implementation then the profile of oil demand will be of continued growth. But if the world does implement policies more rigorously, as its showing signs of doing today, then the peak could come in the late 2020s, 2030s, he said.', 'We dont know that but we do know though is that even when oil demand does peak at some point in the future, it isnt going to drop off a cliff because substitute-ability for oil in so many sectors is still elusive  shipping, aviation, trucking, petrochemicals  there are still huge driving forces (for oil demand), Atkinson told CNBCs Squawk Box Europe in November.', 'He said Saudi Arabia, the second largest oil producer in the world after the U.S. and ahead of Russia, was a cornerstone of that future oil supply. Theres going to be rising demand for at least the next decade for oil products, possible longer, and this is cementing their role as the cornerstone player in global markets, the most reliable and biggest supplier in markets, he said.', 'GCC wealth to fall?', 'nAnticipating and preparing for what comes next will be critical for oil-exporting regions, including countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) which is home to the largest concentration of oil exporters, collectively producing over one-fifth of the global oil supply.', 'Oil producers like Saudi Arabia are seeking to diversify their economies away from their dependence on oil but, as the IMF noted, the commodity remains critical.', 'Although the importance of non-oil sectors has increased in recent decades, many of them rely on oil-based demand either in the form of public spending of oil revenue or private expenditure of oil-derived wealth, the IMF said.', 'The 201415 oil price shock, which notably slowed non-oil growth in most of the region, was a stark reminder of this dependence. Recognizing this challenge, the GCC countries are all implementing programs to diversify their economies as well as fiscal and external revenues away from oil. The success of these programs will be central to achieving strong and sustainable growth in the years to come.', 'The IMF said that the slowing global demand for oil spells a significant fiscal sustainability challenge for the GCC region.', 'The decline in oil revenues (since 2014) sparked a period of intensive reforms, including sizable fiscal consolidations. Nevertheless, the effect of lower hydrocarbon revenue is yet to be fully offset. And the resulting fiscal deficits have lowered the regions net financial wealth during 201418. A path of prolonged deceleration in hydrocarbon revenue growth would add to this decline in wealth. At the current fiscal stance, the regions existing financial wealth could be depleted in the next 15 years.', 'The IMF said that the fiscal policy need implied by this challenge is both larger and more urgent when compared to countries existing plans.', 'All GCC countries have recognized the lasting nature of their challenge and are already planning continued fiscal adjustment in the context of their broader strategic long-term visions. However, the expected speed and size of these consolidations in most countries may not be sufficient to stabilize their wealth.', 'These adjustments need to be accelerated and sustained over a long period of time, in line with the expected path of hydrocarbon revenue, the IMF argued.', 'Managing the long-term fiscal transition will require wide-ranging reforms and a difficult inter-generational choice. Continued economic diversification will be important but would not suffice on its own. Countries will also need to step up their efforts to raise non-oil fiscal revenue, reduce government expenditure, and prioritize financial saving when economic returns on additional public investment are low.', 'nSource: CNBC']"

On Wednesday, oil prices advanced on hopes that the OPEC and its allies would further curb oil production, although the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported a build of 3.355 million barrels of crude oil inventories during the week ending Jan. 31, which was more than an expected increase of 2.831 million barrels, implying weaker demand and bearish for crude prices.', 'Anas Alhajji, an energy-markets expert based in Dallas, U.S. state of Texas, told Xinhua, Markets were looking for large cuts, especially that a couple of news organizations have erroneously reported a large drop in Chinese oil demand because of the coronavirus.', 'He said, The objective of OPEC and its allies is to prevent a large build in inventories in the first half so they can decline significantly in the second half.', 'Meanwhile, the U.S. Dollar Index closed the week at its highest since October 2019 after five consecutive days of increase. Analysts expected the index will test the 99.00 level next week. A higher index makes the U.S.-dollar-sensitive crude oil more expensive for foreign buyers.', 'For the upcoming weeks, analysts suggested the focus on a potential tightening in supply. They believed the effects of coronavirus on oil demand would not be considered to have a significant impact in the long term.', 'Also weighing on the output-cut decision by OPEC and its allies is the blockade of Libyas ports which has hampered its oil exports.', 'The state-owned Libyan National Oil Corporation (NOC) said on Tuesday that the countrys daily production of crude oil has dropped from more than 1.2 million barrels per day to fewer than 200,000 barrels per day as a result of the closure of oil fields and ports.', 'Tribal leaders in eastern Libya closed oil ports recently, accusing the UN-backed Libyan government of using oil revenues to support armed groups against the east-based army.', 'The east-based army has been leading a military campaign since early April 2019, attempting to take over the capital Tripoli from the UN-backed government.', 'Analysts believe the effect of novel coronavirus on the oil demand would be short lived, and they expected a strong rebound in oil demand in the subsequent quarters as the concerns over a tight supply are growing.', 'nSource: Xinhua']"

Director of Marketing and Midstream Tom Lloyd said the company is now capable of increasing production at a faster rate due to its presence in multiple shale plays, but that rate has caused problems finding pipelines to connect with.', 'We can [produce] with these unconventional fields much more quickly, Lloyd said. The disconnect is, how fast can we ramp up or ramp down, and how do we marry that with midstream assets?', 'With the ongoing low-price environment for oil and gas, producers are not interested in just having a connecting pipeline. They are looking for a pipeline that can carry their product to the most profitable locations.', 'We want to take [production] from the wellhead, through midstream to whoever can make the most capital out of it, said Jim Finley, CEO of Finley Resources, a company active in the Uinta Basin. You need to know the strength and weaknesses of refineries and the strength and weaknesses of the midstreams.', 'Lloyd said Marathon has the luxury of being able to move capital to other basins and slow down projects if midstream capacity is unavailable where they are operating. While Marathon and others have that advantage, midstream companies require some guarantee that they will get their moneys worth from a new project, which puts pressure on the producer.', 'We ramp up, ramp down more easily, and thats great in many respects. One thing weve seen is [with] the communication between you and the midstream partner  transparency is absolutely critical, Lloyd said. Its tough when it comes to five-year, 10-year, 20-year midstream relationships.', 'Former DCP Midstream President Brian Frederick said pipeline providers are showing flexibility of their own, assembling agreement terms that are at least partly based on the reliability of the upstream partner.', 'We would do a lot of different deals, and a lot would depend on the producers themselves, Frederick said. Good forecasters, we would do one kind of deal. We used to love ownership deals, where the producer would take part ownership, because they would have a line of interest.', 'Having a strong rapport is critical in determining how much capacity is needed as opposed to how much a producer may want, Frederick said.', 'Midstreamers probably want 80%-90% utilization. Producers probably only want 50%, so they can ramp up quickly and have that extra capacity, Frederick said.', 'While midstream companies are looking for assurances that they will receive a preset amount of production as part of an agreement, producers are seeking certainty that the pipelines will be done on time and going to the most profitable places.', 'We want to know that theres a track record, a history that projects will be done on time and on budget, Lloyd said.

    "title": "Perfect Market Storm Could Drive Oil Prices Below $30",
    "content": "['While it wont be all about the Coronavirus outbreak currently crippling Chinas economy, the pandemic and a whole host of scenarios could play out in tandem to drive the oil price down below $30 per barrel levels.', 'Such a drop has happened recently in very different circumstances. In 2016, a full blown supply glut happened when U.S. shale output continued to pick up and Saudi Arabias former oil minister Ali Al-Naimi kept OPECs taps open. As a result, on Friday, January 15 that year the Brent-West Texas Intermediate spread was barely distinguishable at the end of the week, with Brent closing at $29.25 per barrel and its American benchmark counterpart at $29.72.', 'Since it was oversupply sentiment that knocked market confidence four years ago, the mood music was swiftly improved by the then newly appointed Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman pushing Al-Naimi into retirement, and reaching out to Russia forming the 24-member OPEC+ group thats still busy cutting 1.7 million bpd of production out of the global supply pool.', 'Subsequently, by the last Friday of 2016 Brents premium had been restored at about $3 per barrel and prices were back above $55. Swatting away the latest bearish headwinds will be harder and short traders sense it could all get much worse.', 'First off, its a slump in Chinese demand thats the primary bearish factor here; an economy that despite its readjustment still consumes on average 14 million barrels per day (bpd). In grappling with and getting a handle on the Coronavirus, Beijing has put millions of people in quarantine, extended the Chinese New Year holiday, and shuttered offices, factories, shipyards, shopping malls, cinemas and other public places.', 'Whole towns in Hubei province, including Wuhan where the outbreak originated have been off limits for weeks. This is likely to knock Chinas demand, at least for the first quarter, by 18% to 25% according to industry surveys and the plethora of anonymous comments by oil executives to newswires. If pegged at a median of that range, it comes to around 3 million bpd less required by China as its economic activity declines.', 'Thats bearish factor one, and the second bearish factor is the domino effect of the pandemic. The outbreak has spread to over 20 countries and led to 715 deaths at the time of writing. One clear macroeconomic casualty would be civil aviation industry not just within and to/from China but globally, with fewer travelers, higher restrictions and global health-related wariness over flying.', 'Lower calls on jet fuel in Asia are becoming visible and many international airlines have temporarily suspended flights to China. According to Reuters, on the U.S. West Coast, jet fuel prices have taken a severe knock as cheaper supplies are being sent into the region from Asian markets.', 'Jet fuel for delivery into Los Angeles JET-LA was down 25% on January, to $1.5997 on Monday (February 3) from $2.1266 a gallon. While that might make airplanes cheaper to fill up, lower number of passengers and fewer flights in its wake would again drive consumption lower. Both factors are good enough to spook the market on their own and its already happening.', 'Youll often hear in current market discourse that oil has fallen 20% of its peak this year, except that the trading year is only into its second month, and has had a short-lived rally past $70 in Brents case following the U.S.-Iran tiff after the killing of the Islamic Republics Quds Force General Qasem Soleimani in an American airstrike. Nonetheless, a drop is a drop.', 'The third bearish factor could be OPEC+ discord. The groups discipline has held firm since 2016 but the Russians have over-promised and havent delivered. Yet, OPECs credibility is predicated these days on Moscows participation.', 'When the magnitude of demand destruction following the Coronavirus outbreak became apparent, OPEC+ representatives came together on February 4-5 but failed to reach an agreement on the proposed deepening of cuts by 600,000 bpd despite extending talks to a third day as the Russians blocked it. If OPEC+ discipline cracks and barrels flow freely, market bears will have a merry dance.', 'The fourth bearish factor is actual global demand which wasnt much to write home about in the first place before the Coronavirus outbreak. Demand growth expectations for 2020 were in the range of 800,000 bpd to 1.4 million bpd, with the International Energy Agency (IEA) putting it in the region of 1.2 million bpd.', 'Many analysts, myself included, were leaning towards the lower end of market projections with the Indian economy looking dicey, and South Koreas and Japans crude importation in decline since 2018. With the Coronavirus outbreak, all old projections are out of the window and 2020 may yet be the year where there might be considerably lower demand growth, negligible demand growth or even a possible decline.', 'Only market projection available so far is from BP, with the company noting that global demand growth could be 300,000-500,000 bpd lower than its internal 2020 projection of 1.2 million bpd. If reflected in the data, that equates to one-third of demand growth being wiped out.', 'Finally, this brings us to the fifth bearish factor  supply. Lower pricing will inevitably hit exploration and production activity in marginal plays. However, where output is conventional and onstream, there is nowhere for that oil to go but out. Add to that some U.S. shale players with viable acreages and sub-$35 break-evens, run in the spirit of private enterprise that will continue to monetize their barrels.', 'Overall non-OPEC production could come in anywhere between 2.1-2.3 million bpd, with barrels not just from the U.S. but Brazil, Canada, Guyana and Norway as well. Combine the factors and you have demand destruction on a scale and speed that is unprecedented this century. Neither SARS (2002), Ebola outbreak (2013) nor the global financial crisis (2008) can match it, and itll be coupled with ample barrels on the supply-side.', 'As Q1 2020 heads for the lowest quarters of global growth on record, theres no sugar coating it  the oil market is staring at a proper crisis at the worst possible time and place. Should all bearish factors fall in line, many would call it a black swan event. I prefer to call it the perfect storm thatll take prices down below $30.', 'Maybe, one of the five factors may not materialize as possible OPEC+ action could avert the storm. However, even that wont be enough to calm heavy bearish headwinds that have been blowing hard for five successive weeks of oil price declines.', 'nSource: Forbes']"

In addition, the country uses gas for reinjection into oil fields as part of enhanced oil recovery (EOR) projects. To meet this growing demand, the UAE is moving forward with development of sour-gas fields that were discovered in the 1980s.', 'The announcement that ADNOC and Dubai have agreed to jointly develop the new gas find is a promising sign as this could expedite the development of the new resource and bring additional gas volumes by 2025.

    "content": "['Chinas plan to cut tariffs on imports of US crude but leave duties on LNG in place for now renewed uncertainty for American producers and liquefaction facility developers that already faced a tough field in Asia.', 'Januarys initial trade agreement between Washington and Beijing held out the hope for new long-term contracts for supplies from existing and proposed US export terminals. So far, however, it has done little to relieve the pressure on the industry.', 'With record low prices for LNG in key end-user markets, weaker-than-expected demand and trade flow disruption following the coronavirus outbreak, US operators have been counting on China reducing or eliminating its 25% tariff on US LNG. On Thursday, China said it would lower the tariff on imports of US crude to 2.5% from 5% on February 14. Other US products, including soybeans, also received relief. But the wait for LNG continues.', 'They are having a difficult time doing anything with tariff uncertainty, Yong J. An, a former legal counsel for Korea Gas, said of US exporters and Chinese buyers, during an industry conference earlier this week in Houston. Asia is looking and waiting for a good solid policy decision from the administration.', 'Cheniere Energy, which operates export facilities in Louisiana and Texas, is currently the only long-term supplier of US LNG to a Chinese customer. It has a 1.2 million mt/year supply contract with PetroChina. Cargoes under the contract have continued to be lifted, but have been diverted since China raised its tariff on US LNG last year to 25% from 10%.', 'In the meantime, several developers of new liquefaction facilities in the US have repeatedly delayed final investment decisions, some to 2021 and beyond. Last week, Magnolia LNG developer LNG Limited warned that it needed to immediately raise additional cash to be able to continue normal operations.', 'For years, the expectation had been that China, the worlds most populous country, would become a major customer of US LNG, helping developers sanction new projects. By the end of this decade, it is expected to be the biggest importer of LNG, and the US has been on a trajectory to be the biggest exporter even before then.', 'Counting on Chinese demand, several US developers have chosen locations specifically to reduce the shipping distance to markets in East Asia. Examples include Alaska LNG and Pembinas Jordan Cove LNG in Oregon. Expected startup of both projects has been delayed multiple times. Neither has announced a final investment decision.', 'Virus impact', 'nThe coronavirus outbreak has complicated matters for US developers by sparking fears of a major economic slowdown in China, amid quarantine measures and travel restrictions. A source close to Chinas state-owned CNOOC said Thursday that the company has declared force majeure on LNG contracts. Such a declaration typically amounts to an unforeseen circumstance that prevents a counterparty from fulfilling a contract.', 'The move came as Chinas largest LNG importer tackled disruptions in downstream markets in the wake of the outbreak. It further dimmed Chinas demand outlook and raised concerns about its impact on global trade flows and prices, with Platts JKM  the benchmark price for spot LNG in Northeast Asia  plunging to a historic low of $3.15/MMBtu on Wednesday.', 'Whether other Chinese LNG importers might use the outbreak as a reason to issue a force majeure declaration remained unclear. A Cheniere spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether there could be any impact to the PetroChina contract.', 'nSource:xa0', 'nttttttttttntttttnttttttttt']"

    "content": "['A young Omani geologist, Asad, conducts tours of the famous Wadi Shab while planning to work in his profession. The new geological park, just opened at Jebel Buhais in Sharjah, reminds us of how important the regions rocky foundation is to its past, present and future. Hopefully it will encourage more people to study this vital science.', 'The Jebel Buhais centre tells the story of how Sharjah, and the whole Arabian continental plate, drifted over the last hundreds of millions of years from south of the equator to the northern subtropics, and separated from Africa along the line of the Red Sea, an incipient ocean. As Arabia collided with the Iranian land mass, a slice of the ocean crust and upper mantle some 10 kilometres thick was forced on to land. Such an occurrence, known as an ophiolite, is the only way we can directly study the structure of the oceanic rocks. The ophiolite in Oman and the northern UAE is the best preserved and exposed in the world.', 'Such rocks are rich in minerals, including chromite and copper. In antiquity, Magan, now modern-day Oman, was the source of copper for the Bronze Age civilisations of Mesopotamia. Modern mining is now an important part of Omans efforts to diversify its economy.', 'The geological folds around Jebel Buhais are also found in the subsurface, where they form traps for oil and gas. The study of such structures is vital for exploration such as last months well in Sharjah that found the emirates first new gas field in 30 years. The UAE is a mosaic of folds related to the Oman mountains, older features inherited from the assembly of the Arabian continental plate, and domes created by subsurface salt deposits, also major traps for petroleum.', 'Significant earthquakes are rare in the UAE and Oman, but we often feel milder shocks from quakes taking place in the mountain belts in Iran and Pakistan, formed by ongoing continental collisions. A huge tsunami struck the northern Omani coast a thousand years ago, triggered by a tremor in the Makran belt on the northern side of the Arabian Sea. Evaluating such geohazards is crucial for setting building costs and establishing emergency warning systems.', 'The Jebel Buhais geological display also features a wide range of fossils from the limestone rocks that overlie the ophiolite. Some, such as marine snails, are familiar; some are long-extinct  such as the ammonites, spiral-shelled relatives of squid, and rudists, large cup-shaped shells whose remains lie abundantly on the parks slopes.', 'These give insights into past climates and the quality of reservoirs for oil, gas and water. The Gulf owes its mineral wealth and its modern history to the unique confluence of organic-rich rocks from ancient tropical seas that form hydrocarbons when deeply buried  giant structures to trap oil and gas, and porous reservoir rocks from which it can be tapped by wells.', 'Elsewhere, geoscientists have mapped the jigsaw puzzle of the continents to show exactly where they fitted together into Pangaea  all Earth. Such clues have encouraged exploration in places like Guyana, the newest significant oil-producing country, by analogy with once-adjacent petroleum basins in Africa.', 'Over the past few hundred thousand years, Sharjah went through a series of drier and more humid phases, related to the ice-ages in more northerly latitudes. When sea-levels were low as water was locked up in polar ice-caps, early humans were able to cross the Red Sea to settle in southern Arabia. Water that collected underground in rainy times was the key source for agriculture and life up to the modern period. Date palms and bananas grow luxuriantly in the water trapped in the narrow Wadi Shab in Oman.', 'Geologists are now called on to apply this study of ancient climates to the near future. The accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels and forests is warming the Earth, risking returning to a climate hotter than modern humans have ever experienced. Careful study of fossils, sediments and the geochemistry of rocks gives vital indications of just how much warming we can expect from a certain amount of carbon dioxide.', 'Geology also has an essential role to play in tackling climate change. Novel green energy technologies such as solar panels, wind turbines, electric motors and batteries require new and exotic minerals. Nickel, for instance, present in the ophiolite belt, is used in many battery designs.', 'Carbon dioxide can be put back into the ground instead of being released into the atmosphere. Abu Dhabi has the worlds first large-scale carbon capture project applied to an industrial facility, the Emirates Steel plant, and Adnoc plans to have more. With similar technologies to oil and gas production, this requires mapping suitable underground storage reservoirs with sealing rocks to prevent the carbon dioxide leaking out, and monitoring its flow through the subsurface.', 'This brings us back to ophiolites. Their minerals react rapidly with carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to form calcium carbonate, the main constituent of limestone. The Oman ophiolite is full of veins created in this way. Geoscientists Juerg Matter and Peter Kelemen from Columbia University have proposed that we could store 4-5 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide annually, of the 36.6 billion tonnes emitted worldwide, by drilling into the ophiolite rocks and circulating hot water saturated with carbon dioxide.', 'Geology in the Gulf of course concerns petroleum, but also covers crucial topics such as mining, water, earthquakes, climate and the environment. Jebel Buhais and other sites in the region remind us that geoscience is about the deep past but also the near future. A fascinating and crucial range of careers are open to the young Omani geologist Asad, and others like him.', 'nSource: The National']"

But recent challenges are raising doubts about the pace and certainty of liberalization.', 'Brazils so-called New Gas Market was inaugurated in June with decisive regulatory changes aimed at ending state-owned oil company Petrobras monopoly in the countrys onshore markets, and bringing with it the opportunity for increased foreign investment and market efficiency.', 'The stakes couldnt be higher. A successful outcome could lower fuel prices for power generators and industry, bring a wave of new foreign investment to Brazil, and give the countrys struggling economy a decisive boost.', 'Even for neighboring countries  including Argentina, Bolivia and Chile  a fully liberalized gas market could pave the way for similar reforms across South Americas southern cone, potentially creating an integrated regional market that could ultimately become a major consumer and exporter of LNG.', 'Transport, distribution and onshore production', 'nWithin weeks of the new regulatory framework being introduced, Petrobras announced the sale of a 90% stake in two key midstream gas transportation companies: Transportadora Asociada de Gas or TAG and Nova Transportadora do Sudeste or NTS, both of which account for two-thirds of the countries gas pipelines.', 'Furthermore, Petrobras also sold major stakes in its state-level gas distribution companies to Japans Mitsui. Previous to the sale, Petrobras had held a stake in 21 of Brazils 27 state gas distributors.', 'Just two months later, another of Petrobras midstream subsidiaries, Transportadora Brasileira Gasoduto Bolvia-Brasil or TBG,  which imports over one-fifth of the countrys marketed gas supply on the 1.1 Bcf/d Gasbol import pipeline from Bolivia  announced an open season for some 60% of its capacity.', 'In the open season, TBG approved the participation of 18 rival shippers. Among them were foreign oil companies, industrial end-users and state-level distribution companies, along with Petrobras.', 'Brazils National Petroleum Agency, or ANP, simultaneously announced plans to reactivate Brazils stalling onshore production  which now comprises less than 20% of the country total domestic output  in a coordinated effort to bring new, third-party producers into Brazils gas market.', 'In the weeks that followed, the future of Brazils New Gas Market looked bright, with competitive gas imports from Bolivia expected to hit the domestic market by January 2020.', 'That burgeoning promise was scuttled just days before Petrobras 20-year gas import contract with Bolivia was scheduled to expire on December 31. At the time, ANP abruptly suspended its open season for the Gasbol import pipeline, citing irregularities in the bidding process.', 'Petrobras, it said, had submitted a bid for the pipelines entire 18 million cu m/d contracted import capacity, citing political instability in Bolivia for its aggressive bidding move.', 'In a subsequent decision that followed weeks later, the ANP reauthorized its Gasbol open season under new rules that will exclude the participation of Petrobras. Still, the delay has raised questions about whether and how quickly other sectors of Brazils natural gas market will liberalize.', 'LNG and offshore competition', 'nAs Petrobras ambitious and hopeful rivals await the launch of ANPs reauthorized open season in August, competitive forces in other sectors of Brazils gas market seem to face a longer time horizon.', 'Brazils first private LNG-to-power project, which could begin ramping up just days from now, promises to bring competitively priced LNG imports to Brazils Northeast. But with limited pipeline infrastructure in the region, excess LNG supplied to the project isnt likely to reach Brazils broader market in any meaningful way.', 'A second private LNG-import project at the Port of Au in the state of Rio de Janeiro state, could offer better access to Brazils gas grid, but currently faces a longer time horizon for completion.', 'Third-party producers already operating in Brazils offshore subsalt fields offer Brazils most hopeful, but also its most distant source, of competitively priced gas supply.', 'With existing and under-construction offshore-to-onshore pipeline routes largely controlled by Petrobras, third-party producers face limited access to the liberalizing midstream markets onshore.', 'The limitation reduces the effectiveness of offshore gas meeting Brazilian demand and easing pricing. Over the past five years, Brazils offshore gas production has grown by 31%, reaching over 4 Bcf/d this past summer.', 'According to recent data from Brazils Ministry of Mines and Energy, Petrobras supplies gas to end-users at around $8 to $9/MMBtu  a steep premium when compared to sub-$2/MMBtu gas at the US Henry Hub.', 'Under the existing regulatory framework, getting competitively priced offshore gas production into Brazils domestic market requires that third-party producers finance, fund and construct new subsea pipeline routes  a planning and logistical process that could take years.', 'nSource: ', 'nttttttttttntttttnttttttttt']"

    "content": "['Downstream isnt the glamorous end of the oil business. And in Big Oil, its typically dwarfed by upstream.', 'Yet having been forced to restructure and focus on costs early this century, downstreams cash flow has underpinned a third of the Majors shareholder returns over the last five years.', 'But a laser-like focus on costs and efficiency can only take you so far. If the external environment turns against you, downstream is as vulnerable as any part of the business.', 'The Majors downstream results for the fourth quarter of 2019 were among the poorest since 2015. Petrochemicals is part of that story, with earnings suffering from over-investment.', 'Now were also seeing refining margins come under increasing pressure, slipping to five-year lows in the last few weeks of 2019 and the first of 2020.', 'Alan Gelder, VP Refining, identifies two main factors.', 'First, IMO 2020 hasnt played out as expected', 'New regulation on marine fuels was expected to boost refining margins this year but that hasnt played out as expected yet. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) regulations require all vessels to reduce the level of sulphur in their engine emissions from 3.5% to 0.5% or less from 1 January.', 'Essentially, IMO should trigger a shift out of low-value product (High Sulphur Fuel Oil, or HSFO) into higher value Very Low Sulphur Fuel Oil (VLSFO). Refinery capacity to make VLSFO is limited, so marine gasoil, which is closely linked to the price of diesel, would top up any shortfall. This shift to high-value products was expected to drive up refining margins in 2020.', 'Its only half happened. The price of VLSFO surged in the fourth quarter and HSFO duly collapsed. The surprise was that theres been much more VLSFO available than expected. Traders had taken advantage of low-price feedstock in late summer 2019 and built up volumes of VLSFO in storage. When the demand came in, they were ready and cashed in, big time. A single tanker loaded with 2 million barrels of VLSFO could make over US$10/bbl on the spread and pull in U.S.$20 million-plus in cash profit.', 'Producers with the right crude have also fared well. Santos revealed that it had sold a single cargo of heavy sweet crude, ideal feedstock for VLSFO, at an unheard-of US$30/bbl premium to Brent. Nice work if you can get it.', 'What didnt really materialise was higher demand for marine gasoil  its just not been needed in the volumes anticipated. Weaker marine demand for gasoil has been compounded by soft demand from heating  a much bigger market  because of warm winter weather in the northern hemisphere and lacklustre economic growth. Thats led to a glut of gasoil in inventory which is depressing refining margins.', 'Second, demand is falling sharply', 'Global oil demand growth forecasts are falling back sharply  potentially a more fundamental problem. The biggest factor is the coronavirus, so we have reduced our demand forecasts in China by almost 0.6 million b/d for the first quarter of 2020. We now expect China demand to fall year-on-year by 125,000 b/d for the quarter, the worst rate since 2009. Global demand will fall by 250,000 b/d, also the worst in over a decade.', 'So whats next for refining? The VLSFO surplus should be a short-term phenomenon. Theres not enough refining capacity to supply all bunker demand with VLSFO. That gap will have to be met by additional gasoil once the surplus VLSFO in inventory is soaked up, by H2 2020 at the latest.', 'The prospects for oil demand are more worrying and harder to call. At this stage, we have restricted our adjustments to the first quarter and left the rest of the year largely unchanged. If the virus can be contained successfully in the coming weeks, demand could bounce back strongly  much as was the case with SARS in 2003.', 'Refining margins so far this quarter suggest it will take a while before refining profitability recovers. Meantime, refiners will do what they must to keep costs down and maximise cash flows, including cutting refinery runs to limit the build-up in inventory. Its about toughing it out, waiting and hoping for demand  China in particular  to perk up again.', 'nSource: Wood Mackenzie']"

    "content": "['Deal activity in 2019 has largely revolved around the need to improve company finances and reduce debt. It drove multinational oil and gas companies, such as ExxonMobil, ConocoPhillips, and Chevron, to review their global operations and begin divesting non-profitable ventures, according to GlobalData, a leading data and analytics company.', 'The companys latest report, M&A in Oil and Gas  2020, evaluates how oil and gas companies are utilizing mergers and acquisitions (M&A) to realign their businesses with respect to changing market scenarios.', 'Ravindra Puranik, Oil & Gas Analyst at GlobalData, comments: During the oil price downturn of 20142017, many exploration and production (E&P) companies were able to receive refinancing from investors for about six to seven years amid hopes of price recovery. However, oil prices have not risen sufficiently enough while the debt raised by operators is nearing its repayment period in the next two years. This is raising alarms across the global oil and gas industry, and influencing deal activity. Many companies are starting to show capital prudence, and are resisting from making rash acquisitions. A classic example of this change of approach was Chevron, which stayed away from starting a bidding war with Occidental Petroleum over Anadarko Petroleum.', 'Divestment appeared as prominent global trend among several oil and gas companies worldwide during 2019. Throughout the year, companies focused on selling assets to exit from non-profitable ventures or from weak competitive positions in the market. This is likely to enable companies to focus on core businesses and reduce debt levels.', 'Puranik adds: Recently, oil and gas companies have focused on prioritizing their areas of operations more on markets closer to their traditional bases. Hence, we are likely to see the UK or European operators acquiring assets in the North Sea, or the US-based companies and oil majors targeting independent shale drillers.', 'GlobalDatas thematic research identifies such companies within the oil and gas industry that are likely to offer either a part or the entire company for sale in the coming two years across the value-chain. It includes independent shale drillers, such as Concho Resources, Diamondback Energy and Parsley Energy; and midstream and downstream operators, such as HNA Group, Novatek Puma Energy, and Hascol Petroleum which may divest a partial stake in the near future.', 'Environmental concerns and stricter norms imposed by authorities are further restricting the carbon-intensive industry from operating in specific geographic areas. As a result, in 2019, companies also announced their exits from projects that generate high carbon emissions or are located in ecologically sensitive areas.', 'Puranik concludes: Oil and gas giant BP announced to sell its entire business in Alaska to Hilcorp Energy for a total consideration of US$5.6bn. The deal included sale of BPs upstream portfolio of Prudhoe Bay oil fields in the Alaska North Slope and associated midstream assets in the region. This divestment is likely to help BP in reducing its net methane emissions from global operations.', 'nSource: GlobalData']"

    "content": "['Oil production estimated at 1.2 million barrels per day by 2030, Guyanas total annual oil revenues could approach $30 billion within 10 years, according to fresh research by Rystad Energy.', 'The economic fortunes of Guyana, with a population of only around 800,000, are poised for a major transformation after its first-ever oil development commenced production just six weeks ago. Offshore oil production is expected to grow rapidly in the years to come and will generate unprecedented revenues for the Guyanese government.', 'Since the initial discovery in 2015 of the giant Liza oil field in the prolific Stabroek block, Guyana has discovered more than eight billion barrels of oil resources, says Sonya Boodoo, Vice President of Upstream Research at Rystad Energy. Liza was brought on stream in December and many more fields will follow suit in due course. Guyanas rising oil revenues will make a huge difference in the continued development of the country. At the same time, in order for Guyana to realize the full potential of these resources, a stable regulatory and fiscal environment will be a key factor.', 'Rystad Energy forecasts that Guyanas oil production could reach 1.2 million barrels per day by the end of the decade, lifting total annual oil revenues to about $28 billion, assuming an oil price of about $65 per barrel. Government income in the country  projected to be a modest $270 million or so in 2020  is forecast to grow rapidly and could reach nearly $10 billion annually within a decade. Putting that figure into context, Guyanas gross domestic product currently stands at about $3.7 billion.', 'Between 2015 and 2019, oil and gas companies invested around $8.1 billion in exploration and development activities in Guyanas offshore sector. Under the countrys fiscal regime, these companies assume all risks during the exploration phase, which explains the negative free cash flow (FCF) seen thus far. Going forward, these costs  including both investments and operational expenses  will grow as new development projects are approved and new fields are brought on stream. At the peak, the annual costs are expected to reach around $8 billion.', 'Guyanas fiscal regime and overall take has been heavily discussed over time, both domestically and internationally. In 2018, the International Monetary Fund published a paper advising Guyanas government to increase government take for new licenses in order to reflect the impressive run of exploration successes in the Stabroek Block.', 'The current fiscal regime for Stabroek involves a transparent profit-sharing contract with three main components: a 2% royalty, a profit oil level of 50%, and a cost recovery ceiling of 75%. The contract is reflective of the situation at the time of signing back in 1999, when multiple companies had encountered several dry exploration wells. At the time, E&P companies were seen to be taking a considerable risk by conducting deepwater exploration in the region. To make such frontier drilling attractive, Guyana offered competitive fiscal terms, Boodoo says.', 'Rystad Energy has benchmarked the Stabroek fiscal regime against the fiscal regimes of other frontier and upcoming oil and gas producing countries, such as Brazil, the United States (deepwater Gulf of Mexico), Mozambique, Israel, Tanzania, Mauritania, Suriname, and the Falkland Islands.', 'To measure the impact of the fiscal regimes in these countries, Rystad Energy has run its economic model analysis on the Liza Phase 1 project and compared the results against the fiscal regimes for the peer group countries. From there we derive the estimated government take under each countrys fiscal regime, calculating the split of profits between the E&P companies and the government. Government take is defined as the present value of the government take divided by the present value of the profit, where profit is revenue minus investments and operational costs.', 'For Guyana, the average government take is 60%, which in our benchmarking overview places the country right between major producer Brazil at 63% and fledgling producers Mozambique and Mauritania, at 57%.', 'We find the current fiscal regime in Guyana to be in line with other emerging oil and gas countries. As Guyana firms up its credentials as an attractive upstream destination, we expect that new awards of production sharing agreements will likely stipulate revised fiscal parameters, with the higher government take, Boodoo concludes.', 'nSource: Rystad Energy']"

But as long as the actual value of R is greater than 1, the epidemic will accelerate, as the number of infected individuals grows exponentially.', 'Eventually, when enough individuals have contracted the disease, developed immunity, recovered, and are no longer susceptible, the transmission rate will decline, which is why epidemics eventually fade out.', 'R will eventually decline below 1 because there are simply not enough susceptible individuals left in the population for the virus to continue spreading, as many have already been exposed and died or recovered.', 'Containment measures aim to bring down the transmission rate more rapidly through quarantine, social distancing, cancelling public events, focusing on super-spreaders, such as healthcare workers, and intensified personal hygiene.', 'CASE FATALITY RATES', 'nThe case fatality rate measures the number of infected individuals who eventually die of the disease or complications, such as secondary bacterial infections.', 'One reason the pandemic of 1918 proved so deadly is that in an era before antibiotics many of those who contracted viral influenza went on to contract bacterial pneumonia.', 'In most instances, viruses tend to be most lethal to the young, the old, those with already weakened immune systems and those with underlying medical conditions.', 'Several million deaths around the world each year are directly or indirectly attributable to the ordinary seasonal outbreaks of influenza, most of them in higher-risk categories.', 'The pandemic of 1918 was unusual because a high proportion of the deaths were prime age individuals, for reasons that are still not fully understood.', 'Case fatality rates are difficult to estimate because the mildest cases may not be reported or recorded leading to an overestimate of mortality.', 'In general, there is a trade off between the reproduction rate and the case fatality rate, because the virus needs to keep its host alive long enough to transmit it to others.', 'The most lethal viruses tend to have relatively low transmission rates, because they kill the host too quickly, while the highly transmissible viruses tend to be less lethal, giving them more opportunity to infect other hosts.', 'But reproduction rates and case fatality rates are notoriously difficult to estimate accurately even after an outbreak has been controlled.', 'ECONOMIC IMPACT', 'nIn any respiratory epidemic, the biggest impact on the economy and oil consumption comes from the containment measures, such as quarantine and social distancing, taken to bring the epidemic under control.', 'Some measures will be ordered by the government to deal with a public health emergency but others will be taken voluntarily by businesses and individuals concerned about limiting exposure to the disease.', 'Social distancing measures can have a large negative impact on both business and consumer spending as well as on manufacturing production, services provision and transportation networks.', 'Like the course of the epidemic, the economic impact tends to be acute rather than lasting, compressed into the space of a few weeks or months.', 'As the outbreak burns itself out, or is effectively controlled, the need for extreme quarantine and social distancing measures declines and activity returns to normal.', 'As the outbreak fades, concern about health risks is eventually displaced by commercial pressure to resume normal activities.', 'Businesses, employees, transport companies, schools are forced to resume near-normal activity in order to earn revenue, get paid, and pass examinations.', 'SEVERITY AND DURATION', 'nIf a typical epidemic lasts less than 13 weeks, peaking around half-way through, the impact on economic activity is likely to follow a similar pattern.', 'The main exception is where the epidemic returns in multiple waves, which is unusual, but happened in 1918/19.', 'In London, the first wave of deaths peaked in week 28 of 1918 (with most deaths between week 25 and week 33). The second peaked in week 44 (with most deaths occurring between 42 and 51).', 'The third wave peaked in week 9 of 2019 (with most deaths starting in week six and ending by week 14), according to contemporary statistics compiled by Britains Ministry of Health.', 'The first wave was comparatively mild with only a few hundred deaths in the capital. The second was much more severe, killing 3,000-4,000 people per week at its peak. The third was somewhere in between.', 'In the current outbreak, the principal impact on Chinas oil consumption is likely to be concentrated in the first quarter of the year, especially in January and February.', 'By March and April, the number of new cases and fatalities should start to decline, and more normal business activity and oil consumption should gradually be restored.', 'There is likely to be some lingering impact on economic activity and oil consumption as businesses and households absorb the loss of revenue and income from the first quarter, but it should fade.', 'But the biggest economic and oil consumption impact will most likely be felt in the first quarter and should start to fade from the start of the second and largely have disappeared by the end of the third.', 'The principal risk is fresh outbreaks in other centres in China or overseas, with a second or third epidemic wave later in the year, which would magnify the economic and oil consumption impact.', 'OIL MARKET IMPACT', 'nChinas oil consumption averaged around 14.5 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2019, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (Short Term Energy Outlook, EIA, Jan. 14).', 'For the sake of illustration, if coronavirus depresses Chinas consumption by 10% on average in the first quarter, 2% in the second quarter and 1% in the third, the total impact will be the loss of around 450,000 bpd on average in 2020.', 'BPs chief financial officer said on Friday that coronavirus could reduce oil consumption by about 300,000-500,000 barrels per day, roughly 0.5% of global oil demand, which is in line with this guesstimate.', 'China, together with India, has accounted for more than 50% of global incremental oil consumption in recent years, so any slowdown would have a major impact on the global production-consumption balance.', 'Oil prices have already fallen sharply to force U.S. shale producers and the OPEC+ group of major oil exporters to implement corresponding reductions in production this year.', 'nSource: Reuters (Editing by Barbara Lewis)']"

    "title": "The Commodities Feed: Oil demand growth numbers",
    "content": "['The oil market couldnt hold onto the strength that we saw for much of yesterday, with ICE Brent closing lower on the day, and settling below US$54/bbl, while NYMEX WTI settled below the US$50/bbl mark for the first time since early January 2019. Early morning trading today has started on a positive note once again, but the risk is that we see a similar trend to previous days, where the strength fizzles out as the day progresses. Yesterdays downward pressure comes despite the likelihood of deeper cuts from OPEC+ growing. The Joint Technical Committee (JTC) met in Vienna yesterday, and proposals reportedly included increasing cuts anywhere between 500Mbbls/d and 1MMbbls/d. The obstacle (as is the case most times) appears to be Russia, which generally has a more relaxed approach when it comes to cutting output. While we may hear plenty of noise around cuts from OPEC+, the JTC cannot make the decision, this would require agreement between all members, hence the need for a meeting sometime in February.', 'Reportedly, OPEC numbers suggest that the coronavirus outbreak could lead to around a 400Mbbls/d drop in demand growth for about 6 months, so basically 200Mbbls/d over the course of the full year. This is where the uncertainty lies, with estimates of the impact on demand varying significantly. Some are looking at a hit of as little as 100Mbbls/d for the full year, whilst some worst-case scenario estimates suggest that we could see as much as 1MMbbls/d of demand growth lost. The longer the spread of the virus lasts, the more likely we start to move closer towards a worst-case scenario. However if we assume that OPEC numbers are correct, and then factor in the supply losses we are seeing from Libya at the moment, and assume that these last through until the end of Q1, 500Mbbls/d of additional cuts should be almost enough to balance the market over Q1, whilst over Q2 we would likely need to see current cuts of 1.7MMbbls/d rolled over through until at least the end of June. Another scenario would be to have a cut of 500Mbbls/d from 2Q20 through until the end of the year, which would mean the Q2 surplus would be offset by a deficit over 2H20.', 'On the demand side, we will have to wait and see when cases peak. Here in Singapore, we had back to back days of no new reported cases, but this was brought to an abrupt end yesterday, with the number of cases jumping by 6 to total 24. More importantly, 4 of these new cases were a result of local transmission, rather than imported cases. As our Asian chief economist pointed out yesterday (and tells me repeatedly), we are at a critical point, where in the next week or two we should get a better idea on whether the virus has been largely contained to China or whether it really is going to go global.', 'Finally, US inventory numbers put further pressure on the oil market late yesterday, with the API reporting that US crude oil inventories increased by 4.18MMbbls over the week, while the market was expecting US inventories to have increased by around 3MMbbls over the week, according to a Bloomberg survey. The market will pay more attention to the EIA weekly release which will come out later today, and a number similar to the API would mean the largest increase in oil inventories since November.', 'Metals', 'nAfter the relentless sell-off over the past two weeks, LME metal prices bounced back yesterday. On the macro side, Beijing signalled support measures to cushion economic growth, providing some comfort to the market. In the short-term, we may see the market become more volatile as participants re-position given the recent price collapse. Consumers may jump in to lock in costs at these lower levels, but the market will still likely face downward pressure from other investors amid the rapid rise of coronavirus cases. While we have highlighted in previous notes the impact that shutdowns in China could have on domestic supply chains, we are also starting to see an impact on global supply chains, with a Korean car manufacturer having to shut down some assembly lines in Korea, due to a lack of parts from China.', 'Turning to ferrous metals, and a report by Chinas Iron & Steel Association (CISA) shows that 18 mills in Shaanxi, Shanxi, and some other provinces could cut output by 55kt/day (the equivalent of c.20mtpa of annual capacity) until the logistical situation in China improves and industrial activity restarts. The curtailed capacity represents nearly 30% of these mills total capacity and reflects the potential impact on iron ore demand within the country if other mills also face similar issues. Iron ore port inventory data has been unavailable in recent weeks due to Lunar New Year holidays; however, a preliminary report from Mysteel shows that iron ore stocks have been piling up at port warehouses due to lower intake from steel mills.', 'Finally, stronger gold prices have been weighing on physical demand of the precious metal in its biggest market, India. Media reports suggest that the countrys gold imports fell more than 50% YoY to total 21.7t in January, after falling 14% for the full year 2019. A slower economy, higher import duties, a weaker INR and stronger prices in the global market have been detrimental for Indias price-sensitive gold market. Chinas gold demand could also take a strong hit in 1Q20 due to ongoing virus concerns and slower economic activity. Despite this poorer demand, it has been investor demand which has been supportive for gold prices, with total known ETF holdings reaching a record 82.96moz, with YTD inflows of around 1.5moz.', 'Daily price update', 'Source: ING']"

Venting releases unburned methane, which is many times more potent than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas. Oil drillers tend to flare or vent gas when they lack pipelines to move it to market, or prices are too low to make transporting it worthwhile.', 'Youve got a real waste issue, said Colin Leyden, a policy advocate for the Environmental Defense Fund, which tracks flaring.

    "content": "['The coronavirus outbreak could curb oil demand growth if it continues to spread, leading to an extended production surplus as production grows in Brazil, Norway and the US, Fitch Ratings says. The surplus magnitude will depend on the duration of the outbreak and the ability of OPEC+ countries to adjust production levels, if required. We expect oil prices to remain highly volatile in 2020, with geopolitical tensions and economic sentiment being other key drivers.', 'Oil prices have been under pressure since the start of the coronavirus outbreak with Brent crude falling from just under USD70 a barrel in early January to about USD56/bbl in early February.', 'In a scenario of materially lower oil prices than assumed in our price deck and weaker market sentiment it could become more challenging for the B-category oil and gas issuers to access capital markets, potentially resulting in a higher default rate in the sector. Ratings of Chinese national oil companies, namely CNPC/PetroChina, Sinopec, and CNOOC are linked to Chinas sovereign rating and would therefore not be immediately affected, despite weakening credit metrics. Asian refiners could see further softening of refining margins due to lower demand and utilisation rates.', 'Oil demand losses are difficult to estimate at this stage, but would come from a combination of reduced air travel, lower domestic road transportation and a longer-than-expected halt of manufacturing activities. The Chinese authorities have extended the Lunar New Year holidays and quarantined about 50 million people living in the Hubei province, which remains the hardest hit. Several other provinces have restricted inter-provincial travel and advised companies to remain closed for at least a week.', 'The impact on Chinese domestic oil products consumption will depend on how quickly transportation and industrial activities will return to normal levels. Demand for imported oil could take even longer to recover, as refineries, which were facing a capacity surplus before the outbreak, will need to absorb excess inventories. The WHOs declaration of a public health emergency of international concern could dampen Chinas trade activities and further reduce domestic fuel consumption, with a more tangible impact on global oil supply-demand balance.', 'China accounts for about 15% of global oil consumption and is the main driver of global demand growth. Its contribution to global consumption growth averaged 36% over the past five years and should have been close to 40% in 2020, according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA). A further 30% of demand growth is driven by other Asian countries, including India.', 'Even without potential consequences from coronavirus, the oil market was expected to be well supplied in 2020. EIA expected supply to exceed demand by about 250,000 barrels a day due to growing production in the US, Brazil, Norway and Guyana. The additional OPEC+ production cuts agreed for 1Q20 may not fully offset this.', 'nIf the coronavirus outbreak deteriorates, the oversupply could become more significant, particularly in 1H20, potentially leading to more short-term pressure on oil prices. A drop in production in Libya following the military conflict in the country could mitigate oversupply, although it is not clear how long Libyan production will remain depressed. OPEC+ policies to manage production in line with demand and price sensitivity of US shale make a protracted dip of oil prices below USD50/bbl for Brent not very likely even in a stress-case scenario. However, OPEC+ may need to cut production further if the outbreak lasts for several months.', 'We rate oil and gas companies using our price deck of USD62.5/bbl in 2020, USD60/bbl in 2021 and USD57.5/bbl in 2022 and beyond, and thanks to realised cost-cutting measures most oil and gas producers feel comfortable with prices between USD50/bbl and USD60/bbl for Brent.', 'nSource: Fitch Ratings']"

Based on current projections, OFE expenditure is expected to continue to increase into the 2020s, with oilfield equipment expenditure reaching a forecast peak of $133bn in 2023.', 'Key Conclusions:', ' Global expenditure of $617bn over 2019-2023; an $18bn uplift on the 2014-2018 period.', 'n Onshore expenditure to total $314bn over the forecast, dominated by tubular goods and rigs & rig equipment  driven by a 32% increase in global onshore drilling.', 'n Offshore expenditure to be dominated by fixed & floating production platforms, totalling $139bn over 2019-2023  underpinned by projects offshore Brazil, Guyana and Saudi Arabia.', 'n China to bolster growth in Asia, as the country solidifies efforts to reduce reliance on hydrocarbon imports through targeting unconventional gas resources.', 'Global OFE expenditure is expected to total $617bn over the forecast period, with onshore focussed spend accounting for 55% of the total. Within the onshore space, tubular goods and rigs & rig equipment will dominate the market. With areas, due for intensive drilling activity, such as the US and China, driving spend. North America, with the expected continuation of growth in US unconventionals, will make up nearly half of forecast onshore expenditure. Despite a continuation of pipeline capacity challenges in Canada, North America will remain the biggest player in the oilfield equipment market over the forecast, with expenditure reaching $38bn by 2023.', 'Outside of North America, Asia will be the next largest onshore OFE market  totalling $77bn over 2019-2023. The region will experience a 15% CAGR in spending, with China driving the increase. In an effort to reduce reliance on hydrocarbon imports, the Chinese government has set lofty production targets, with a focus on unconventional gas. In early 2019, CNPC outlined its five-year exploration and development plan to achieve these production targets, the company aims to drill up to 20,000 wells every year through to 2024  with many targeting shale oil, shale gas and tight gas. Chinas largest producer, PetroChina, expects shale gas production to reach 35 bcm per annum by 2025. Sinopec, forecast that total gas production, helped by new additions from unconventional sources, and the ramp-up of production at fields such as the Changqing oil and natural gas field, should see output reach over 200 bcm per annum (c. 3.6 mmboe/d) by 2025. This is still well below output from onshore US and Russia  but comes close to the 3.8 mmboe/d expected for Qatar in the same year. In January 2020, China officially opened its E&P environment and supply chain, allowing foreign players to explore and produce the countrys reserves for the first time. This move is expected to generate further investment into the countrys supply chain and should help the government reduce reliance on gas imports.', 'The largest component of forecast offshore OFE expenditure will be fixed & floating production equipment, totalling $139bn over the forecast. The floating production platform sector will be bolstered by activity in Latin America, where regional expenditure is set to peak at $15bn in 2022. First oil from Guyanas Liza development in the Stabroek block was achieved in late-December 2019. Up to five FPSOs are due to be deployed on the block over the forecast leading Guyanas oilfield equipment expenditure to reach a forecast peak in 2022. Hess recently announced their 2020 investment plans for Guyana, where they have set aside $1.3 billion in capital and exploration spend for the small nation. Offshore Brazil, continued investment into pre-salt oilfields will also bolster regional spend, with FPS expenditure dominating the countrys OFE market.', 'In the Middle East, brownfield developments in a number of countries, including Saudi Arabia, will support expenditure growth in the fixed production platform sector.

Investors in cigarettes and other tobacco products pulled out of the sector in droves when it was found to have covered up evidence of public health risks from its products. The oil industry risks going the same way, Cramer said.', 'The analogy is not remotely sound. Tobacco was only ever a whimsical human indulgence, though a highly addictive one. Fossil fuel products, on the contrary, have fueled economic growth and well-being for over a century, lifted billions of people out of poverty, and given humans high standards of living.', 'But Cramers comments were the latest example of a trend that has been underway for some time in the financial world. Investors have fallen out of love with fossil fuels in a big way. Why this has happened is of particular importance to Saudi Arabia, now home to the biggest quoted energy company in the world, Saudi Aramco, and still dependent on energy revenue despite the diversification strategy under Vision 2030.', 'A recent report by IHS Markit, the information group in which oil expert Daniel Yergin plays a big role, pointed out that energy stocks have been the worst-performing sector of the booming stock markets of the past decade.', 'Energy now accounts for less than 4 percent of the weightings of the S&P 500 index, compared to 15 percent a couple of decades ago, in a period when the American oil industry has gone through the biggest boom in its recent history, making the US self-sufficient in energy.', 'You would have thought that American investors would have filled their boots with energy shares in appreciation of the US energy miracle, but the opposite has happened. Another energy guru, Halima Croft, the head of commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, told the ADIPEC conference in Abu Dhabi last autumn that there was a danger the energy sector was becoming un-investible.', 'Larry Fink, head of the biggest investment organization in the world, BlackRock, said his firm would divest of the really dirty stuff such as coal, and set restrictions on new investment in other fossil fuels.', 'Fink explained that he was not acting as an environmentalist, but as a responsible capitalist with a duty to clients and investors. Another responsible capitalist  the UKs Guardian Media Group  said it would no longer accept advertising from oil and gas companies.', 'When the big quoted oil companies such as Exxon and Shell reported financial results last week, it did nothing to persuade the financial world that they should get back into energy. Weak profits and cash flows offset the allure of share buyback programs. The shares fell again.', 'The question is whether the unpopularity of energy stocks reflects economic problems in the industry that could prove to be temporary, with good management and better market conditions; or whether it is, as Cramer says, a climate change-induced death knell, compounded by long-term fears about falling demand for fossil fuels and the rise of alternatives such as solar, wind and clean electric cars.', 'The IHS Markit report offered some insight. It was based on a survey of global investors with $98 billion in assets under management, of whom the majority said they were staying away from it because of economic worries  commodity volatility, low returns and supply-demand imbalances  rather than environmental, social or governance fears. These were growing in importance, but not on their own enough to turn people off energy stocks.', 'In other words, if the energy industry gets its act together, the investment world would buy their shares again. In fact, 63 percent thought they were undervalued at current levels.', 'The challenge for energy leaders such as Saudi Aramco is to show that they can simultaneously manage the existing difficult economic environment as well as make the pivot toward energy transition in the new environmentally aware world.', 'nSource: Arab News']"

The move, an apparent violation of the governments interim powers, was made despite Iraqs political crisis and the mass protests pressuring the government.', 'The interim government approved a new round of licences, which had first been granted nine years ago by Hussain al-Shahristani, oil minister in the government of Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki. Subsequent investigations claimed the deals were corrupt and unfair to Iraq.', 'Oil experts said the deals were harmful to Iraqi expertise, mortgaged the countrys economy to foreign interests and incurred tremendous losses to the state treasury. They added to rampant corruption at that time, inflated government spending and killed investment and development programmes, the experts said.', 'Former Iraqi Oil Minister Issam al-Chalabi said resigning Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdis ordering of the Oil Ministry to sign the eighth round of the oil licences was not within the powers of the caretaker government.', 'Chalabi told The Arab Weekly those licences bind Iraq to unfair contracts for more than 25 years and constitute a painful blow to the countrys economic interests.', 'He said history would never pardon those who contributed to squandering Iraqs oil wealth through contracts that offer oil companies unfair privileges against the countrys interests. He stressed that the contracts had been evaluated by Iraqi oil experts who confirmed violations of Iraqs national interests.', 'Chalabi said the recommendations regarding the contracts forced the government of former Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi to refuse to ratify them, despite efforts by former Oil Minister Jabbar al-Luaibi. However, Luaibi ratified the previous round of contracts just before the 2018 elections, maintaining legitimate banditry, Chalabi said.', 'He added that official data confirmed that policies adopted since the 2003 US-led invasion intentionally impedes development of the Iraqi oil industry. He said the burning of 58.3% of the gas associated with oil production in the Basra, Maysan and Dhi Qar oil fields was an indication of waste.', 'Experts have expressed concern about having the associated gas burned. They said not forcing foreign contracting companies to invest in exploitation of associated gas exacerbates the problem.', 'It appears the aim behind the neglect was to maintain Iraqs dependence on Iranian gas. Iraq imports about 28 million cubic metres of Iranian gas to run factories and power plants.', 'The United States has given Baghdad an exemption from sanctions imposed on Iran but there is talk about the possibility of not renewing the exemption.', 'The scandal of the oil licences is linked to Shahristani because he had promoted them in coordination with senior party leaders and tried to replace national oil exploitation expertise and management with foreign companies. The contracts made no provision for ensuring transfer of technology or training and developing local professionals.', 'Iraqis remember Shahristanis promises on October 12, 2009, to boost oil production to 12 million barrels per day within six years and make Iraq one of the largest oil-exporting countries in the world. Observers interpreted those statements as propaganda to win approval for the licensing deal. Ten years later, Iraqs oil production is 4.6 million barrels per day.', 'Oil theft is another aspect of how Iraqs wealth is wasted. Reports indicate that smuggled oil is stolen from punctured pipelines or warehouses. Also, oil derivatives intended for government departments or companies were illegally taken and sold.', 'Another illegal practice is reselling subsidised imported oil derivatives abroad because that makes them cheaper than local products in neighbouring countries. Thieves also exploit apparent laxity in surveillance at Iraqi ports and export more than is being declared in cargo manifests by rigging measuring devices.', 'In a report on Basra, the major oil producing governorate in Iraq, the International Crisis Group said: The militias in this city have penetrated the security services and are engaged in armed battles over oil and that oil smuggling in the city had led to the creation of extremely complex and powerful oil mafia networks.', 'In April 2014, Abadi called on the Integrity Committee to investigate allegations published by the Australian Fairfax Media website and the Huffington Post, a US website, under the headline This is How the West Bought Iraq and take appropriate legal action.', 'The story was one of the largest bribery scandal allegations in the world and it involved Shahristani, Luaibi and other Iraqi officials, who allegedly facilitated the sale of billions of dollars of oil to Western countries through Unaoil, a company owned by Iranian businessman Ata Ahsani.', 'nSource: The Arab Weekly']"

    "content": "['Its said the quote the devil is in the details was originally God is in the details, but in terms of the coronavirus (CV), the details could definitely be the oil markets devil. Many have noted that the SARS virus was a blip on the global oil market, affecting oil demand and prices only briefly and minimally and the coronavirus is much less deadly. The estimated $40 billion loss of global economic activity from SARS is all but invisible when examining the global economy (see figure), and was trivial compared to the 2008 financial crisis. ', 'Even zooming in on China specifically (second figure), annual GDP shows no significant impact from the SARS crisis. (The very smooth shape of the curve probably reflects the tendency of reported GDP growth to track official goals very closely.) More instructive is the third figure, showing oil demand growth in China and Other Asia by quarters, and in the second quarter of 2003 demand is down sharply in both regions before rebounding. Similarly, a year from now, the impact of CV on the global economy should appear fleeting. But the near-term impact could be more significant, especially when considering more specific effects such as on product differentials.', 'Without a doubt, the effects of CV will be different from that of SARS for a number of reasons, especially the fact that, while it appears much less deadly than SARS, it also appears to spread much more easily. And the public reaction might be considered an irrational level of panic (especially given that the flu is much more dangerous yet has minimal effect on peoples behavior or psyches), but it is clearly very real, as air travel to China has plummeted, an effect that could spread to other parts of the world. Which is not to diminish the effect on energy demand from less coffee roasting as Starbucks closes its Chinese stores.', 'The impact becomes more disconcerting when the varied impact on economic sectors is examined. For example, manufacturing will suffer much less than tourism and air travel will be hurt much more than road travel. Indeed, the next figure shows U.S. jet fuel demand and the impact of both the September 11th attacks and the SARS virus are visible, although the former is much more significant.', 'Prices show the effect much more clearly. The next figure shows the differential between the price of a barrel of WTI and prices for jet fuel, motor gasoline, and middle distillate (heating oil in this case, but diesel fuel effectively). Gasoline prices remained robust, but jet fuel and even middle distillate margins were depressed after early March 2003, the date of the declaration of an emergency by WHO.', 'Obviously, there are numerous factors affecting product prices, but if global jet fuel demand drops by 10% or about 1 mb/d for even two weeks, inventories would increase by about 15 million barrels. Given a back-of-the-envelope guesstimate of 200 million barrels global inventories, that represents a big enough increase to affect prices, including for middle distillate which is an (admittedly imperfect) substitute for jet fuel.', 'This means that refineries with lots of hydroprocessing, which maximizes diesel production, will suffer losses compared to those with cracking units that maximize gasoline. The latter tend to predominate in the U.S., the former in Europe and Asia. Product yields also differ by crude, so that Nigerian crudes will be hurt more than U.S. light tight oil. (Talk to Anas Alhajji about #crudequalitymatters.)', 'It is still early days in the CV emergency, and the oil price drop appears overdone, but there is a lot more going on than just the aggregate supply/demand balance tells us. Lets only hope the devil in the details is a minor demon.', 'nSource: Forbes']"

This increase in production, despite the decline in the number of wells, reflects advances in technology and drilling techniques. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)s updated U.S. Oil and Natural Gas Wells by Production Rate report shows how daily production rates of individual wells by state contributed to an increase in total crude oil and natural gas production in 2018.', 'Wells classified as non-horizontal in the reportmost of which are vertical wellshave decreased 10% from 935,000 in 2014 to 842,000 in 2018.

I dont think weve seen the actual demand destruction that will ultimately take place with the reduction in consumer and business activity with all the things that youve mentioned with how the virus is spreading.', 'Plus, markets tend to overemphasize downside demand destruction risks and underestimate supply side destruction risks when it comes to pricing oil, leading to a typical downward bias in prices, Mayor said. Thats been the case in other recent events of geopolitical shocks like the Iran crisis earlier this month, when the U.S. killing of a top Iranian general immediately sent prices spiking higher before rhetoric downplaying fears of a full-blown military conflict sent oil prices sinking lower.', 'Weve seen the $5 per barrel decline even before the virus was announced, Mayor said. And since then, weve seen an even more precipitous decline.', 'Amid the virus, Mayor believes oil prices could fall to a low $50-per barrel range for West Texas intermediate crude and a mid-$50 range for the global benchmark Brent (BZ=F), before recovering.', 'OPEC+', 'nAt the same time, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries wields some power to stabilize global oil prices by manipulating supply, potentially offsetting some of the price declines triggered by the coronavirus, Mayor said.', 'Some members of the 23-nation coalition were considering moving their previously scheduled March 5-6 meeting forward to February, according to reports this week, in response to the oil price impacts seen by the coronavirus.', 'The implication is that the group would use the earlier convention to deepen a supply cut of 1.7 million barrels per day it had agreed back in December to enforce. Each time OPEC+ pulled forward its meetings over the past decade, the group decided to further curtail supplies to help prop up crude oil prices.', 'Debate abounds over whether OPEC+ today can meaningfully move the needle on prices in the current massive global oil market. However, the group nevertheless has more flexibility in making quick changes to supply than its U.S. counterparts, Mayor said, making it an important lever on the supply-side.', 'I dont think domestic U.S. producers can be as agile as OPEC+ can be. Their capital budgets have been constrained, access to financing has been constrained, so we have seen Permian growth, production growth rates, on a definite decline, Mayor said, referring to the slowdown in activity in the U.S. Southwests once-booming Permian Basin. So its still growing but its definitely not growing in the way it was growing even 12-18 months ago. So I dont think well see a supply response that can be as rapid as what OPEC plus can do. And thatll help overall with some of the supply side challenges.', 'Climate change', 'nAll else aside, a growing chorus of stakeholders demanding that asset managers divest from fossil fuel exposure to address climate risks has further pressured the energy industry.', 'BlackRock (BLK), the worlds largest investment company, said earlier this month it would exit investments with high sustainability-related risk like thermal coal and would launch new fossil-fuel investment products. These kinds of corporate moves, along with amplifying rhetoric from activists calling for a low-carbon economy, have started to spook the oil industry, Mayor said.', 'They are very concerned about it, and they are taking action, she said. I would say there are two types of responses. Theres one thats perhaps more of a Big Oil type of response, and I dont mean that at all in a negative way, but youll hear phrases like, We need to decarbonize the hydrocarbons  because lets be real, fossil fuels are very important and a real part of our value chain, and they provide power to the planet, but how do we decarbonize that source of fuel?', 'Then we also hear this sort of big energy response, which is were going to focus on electrification, were going to more quickly pivot away from gas, its not the bridge fuel, she added. The industry is responding on both fronts. They are taking very rapid action, but the crescendo of the messaging is so loud now, the question becomes, can they respond quickly enough and will investors be patient enough with that pace of changes?', 'nSource: Yahoo Finance']"

For the oil and gas industry, changes will occur but the impact of Brexit is unlikely to hamper the strong industry ties that currently exist between the UK and the EU, says GlobalData, a leading data and analytics company.', 'The UK oil and gas industry relies fairly heavily on its EU neighbours. Imported natural gas coming from pipelines that cross Belgium and the Netherlands contributed around 13% of the total natural gas imports into the UK in 2018. In addition, according to UK Government data, UK gas exports to Ireland rose to a four-year high in November 2019 and are expected to continue rising as Irelands domestic supply declines.', 'Daniel Rogers, Oil and Gas Analyst at GlobalData, comments: It is highly likely that the UK will aim to prevent any disruptions to oil and gas arrangements currently in place with EU countries. However, should a devaluation of Sterling against the Euro occur post-Brexit, imported EU-piped gas would become more expensive for the UK  having a knock on effect on the consumer. That being said, alternative avenues of gas imports such as international liquefied natural gas (LNG) create flexible alternatives of energy security for the UK and the gas market will continue to remain competitive while playing a vital role in the UKs energy mix.', 'In terms of crude oil, UK exports to EU countries in 2018 accounted for 63% of the countrys total crude oil exports equating to 10.8bn in value, according to UK Government data. Most of the export value derived from Germany and the Netherlands. Being able to maintain strong oil and gas ties with the EU will be a high priority for the UK as securing reasonable cross border agreements and preserving export ties for UK oil and gas products are of national importance.', 'Rogers continued In the North Sea, there is a number of oil and gas fields either straddling country borders or utilising cross border infrastructure. Past collaborative efforts particularly between the UK, Norway and the Netherlands have enabled cross border developments and generated value for the UK oil and gas industry, something that is unlikely to change as a result of Brexit.', 'nSource: GlobalData']"

    "title": "Libyan Oil Blockade Could Drag On For Months",
    "content": "['In early July 2018, things were looking bleak for general Khalifa Haftar and his Libyan National Army (LNA). A couple weeks earlier, the LNA had seized control of four key ports in the eastern half of Libya, an area that was already largely under its control. It then imposed a blockade on all oil tankers attempting to set sail from those ports, fanning fears of a global supply crunch  Libya exports a little more than 1 million barrels per day  and pushing oil prices higher.', 'Eager to keep prices low, US president Donald Trump threatened legal action against Haftar. And Haftars usual allies  France, Egypt, the UAE  were conspicuously silent this time. The general couldnt have held out for very long.', 'So, in a move that took many off guard, Haftars LNA handed back control of the four ports to Libyas internationally recognized National Oil Company (NOC) on 11 July, 2018. Oil output soon rose back to usual levels and revenue was again flowing through Libyas fragile economy. Global oil markets relaxed.', 'Now Libya finds itself in the middle of another blockade, once again imposed by Haftars LNA. But this time Hafter is likely to hold out longer  perhaps much longer. Fears of an ascendant coronavirus are expected to lop off a sizable share of oil demand, pushing prices lower and giving Haftar cover. Moreover, the LNA now controls an additional 30% of Libyas oil production capacity thanks to recent military gains, giving Haftar more leverage.', 'As always, uncertainty prevails in Libyas civil war. The blockade, now 13 days old, could end as soon as next week, according to Hamish Kinnear of consultancy Verisk Maplecroft. But it also wouldnt be surprising if it lasted much longer. There ispotential for the oil blockade to stretch on for months as both sides refuse to back down.', 'Since shortly after the dictator Muammar el-Qaddafi was killed in a NATO-backed mission in 2011, Libya has been locked in a civil war with no end in sight. The war pits the LNA, based in the eastern city of Tobruk, against the United Nations-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) in the western city of Tripoli. Libya has only six million people, but neither side has managed to gain the upper hand  partly because each is backed by powerful foreign countries, which supply either weapons and mercenaries. The LNA is backed by Russia, the UAE, Egypt, and France, while the GNA is backed Turkey and a number of western governments.', 'In the middle of this fiercely political contest sits Libyas National Oil Company (NOC), the steward of Libyas immensely lucrative oil exports. In order to stay out of the line of fire, it works hard to portray itself as a neutral player. Its technocratic chairman, Mustafa Sanalla, assiduously advertises the neutrality of the company on its Facebook page and in press releases.', 'It has not been enough for Haftar. His LNA has long complained that the money NOC makes from its sales of oil  some $2 billion a month  often wind up in the pockets of mercenaries who are fighting on the side of the GNA. Such grievances were at the heart of the last oil blockade in July 2018, when he called for the removal of the head of the central bank, Saddek el-Kaber. (In Libya, the central bank is responsible for paying the salaries of civil servants, such as teachers and doctors. But there are widespread concerns about corruption.)', 'If Haftar succeeds in gaining access to a larger share of the central banks revenue, he would have more resources for the war effort in north-west Libya, where the capital of Tripoli is based, according to Kinnear.', 'This would not only be in the form of purchasing more military material, but also to use promises of cash to entice wavering or unaligned militia groups based in the west of the country, Kinnear writes in a recent briefing. The strategy of buying out militia groups was a key aspect of the LNAs successful move into south-western Libya in early 2019 and into Sirte [in central Libya] in early 2020.', 'But the LNA would have to keep up its economic siege against the GNA a long time, if it were determined to starve the GNA of revenue. As of October 2019, the central bank had foreign exchange reserves of $77 billion, according to Kinnear, citing central bank data: enough to last months.', 'To resolve a long-running stand off, influential players like the United States may need to play a mediating role, as they have done in the past. In a speech delivered to Chatham House this week, the London-based think tank, the NOCs Sanallah all but pleaded but for foreign powers to step in.', 'So far, however, there have been few indications that foreign powers are poised to play the role of mediator. A ceasefire agreement in Berlin two weeks ago was quickly violated, and, with oil prices under pressure from concerns that the coronavirus is eating into global oil demand, many may be secretly glad that lower Libyan oil supply is helping to somewhat offset a price decline.', 'The current oil blockade is now about as long as the July 2018 blockade. But outside Libya, concern is muted. According to Kinnear: So far there has been no sense of urgency.', 'nSource: Forbes']"

Fighting in Libya resurged over the weekend, torching a cease-fire brokered by Russia and Turkey in early January.', 'Who is rebel general Khalifa Haftar?', 'nThe move is a power play for Haftar, the charismatic leader whose fleet of Libyan militia groups, collectively known as the Libyan National Army (LNA), launched an assault on Tripoli last April thats taken thousands of lives and displaced more than 140,000 people. The rabidly anti-Islamist Haftar is seen as the strongest power player within Libya  whose nearly decade-long conflict now involves several international powers  and his militias control the countrys east and much of its south. The east is home to the lions share of Libyas oil facilities.', 'The output drop in the OPEC state sent the price of Brent crude spiking last week and could be devastating for the Libyan economy. But regional analysts are calling it a quick leverage grab and questioning how long it will last, while noting that ample global crude supply and fears over Chinas coronavirus are keeping a heavy lid on oil prices.', 'The 76-year-old commander, who is credited with a major role in defeating Islamic State militants in 2016 alongside U.S. airstrikes, also happens to be an American passport holder. A rival of longtime Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi, Haftar lived in the Virginia suburbs for several years while working as a CIA asset to plot against the former leader. After the Arab Spring, he apparently spent several years back in Virginia to enjoy his grandchildren, he told the New Yorker Magazine in a 2015 interview.', 'So Haftar poses a massive headache for the U.S. A former ally, they cant exactly sideline him; but his violent assault for power stands in the way of a democratic Libya that Washington had hoped for after its NATO intervention helped topple Gadhafi in 2011 during the Arab Spring.', 'The new Syria', 'nNine years after a U.S.-led coalition toppled Gadhafi, Libya remains a fractured state, ravaged by civil war and terrorism. And a vast array of competing foreign interests have entered the Libyan arena, including Turkey, Russia, Qatar, France, Italy, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt. The lack of stability and outside influence has led some to call it the new Syria.', 'Russia has deployed a few hundred mercenaries from the paramilitary Wagner Group and others into the country to back up Haftar, while Turkey has sent in a few hundred military advisors to support the GNA. The UAE is carrying out airstrikes in Libya, also to help Haftar.', 'We want to avoid Libya becoming the scene of proxy wars, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said in early January. Libya cannot become a second Syria and so we need rapidly to enter a political process, an agreement on an effective cease-fire and an arms embargo.', 'The major players dont seem to be listening. Haftar is now directing renewed fighting in Libyas west after a German-brokered conference in Berlin last week ended with external nations calling for a cease-fire and pledging to end their interference in the war-torn country of 6.4 million. The meeting concluded with Hafter storming out before making any agreements, and Haftar and GNA Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj refused to be in the same room.', 'With fresh violence and foreign fighters spilling into the country in the last week alone, the pledges of non-involvement appear to be falling apart.', 'Russian mercenaries and Emirati airstrikes: Who is backing who in Libya?', 'nLibya has become a near free-for-all for competing international powers: myriad countries are backing the disparate groups fighting on the ground to further their own ideological and financial interests.', 'Turkey, and to a lesser extent Qatar and Italy, support the U.N.-backed GNA  to the extent that Turkey earlier this month began deploying its own advisory troops to the country at Tripolis request. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has also flown some 2,000 mercenary fighters into Libya from the Syrian conflict, which are known to include radical Islamists, to combat Haftars forces. Turkeys support, analysts say, is tied to Ankaras desire for access to Eastern Mediterranean gas drilling.', 'Because Berlin didnt manage to declare a ceasefire or deliver any substantive result, what seems to be happening is Erdogan has every intention to increase that number (of mercenaries) to way beyond 2,000, Jalel Harchaoui, a Libya expert at The Netherlands Institute of International Relations, told CNBC via phone.', 'Meanwhile the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, France and more recently Russia back Haftar. The UAE and Egypt oppose the GNA  which they see as a hotbed of Islamism and Muslim Brotherhood affiliates, something thats anathema to their own governments  and have sent weapons and special forces troops to support Haftars fighters. Experts name the UAE as the most powerful foreign player in the country. In early 2017, Russian mercenaries began appearing in Libya to support Haftar as well, mostly in logistical, support and intelligence roles.', 'For Russia, the move is viewed as a continuation of Moscows expansion and leverage over diplomatic channels in the Middle East and Africa.', 'Libya was always looked at (by Moscow) as the perfect passageway to Africa, Harchaoui said. Russia is interested in any mechanism that allows it to undermine NATO and promote disunity within European bloc Libya is perfect.', 'No end in sight', 'nThe UAE in recent years has violated U.S. arms embargoes, delivering planeloads of weapons to Haftars fighters. But with increasingly close relations between Abu Dhabi and the Trump administration, Washington has so far declined to openly rebuke the Emiratis. The UAE foreign ministry did not reply to a CNBC request for comment.', 'Over the weekend, the U.N. mission to Libya rebuked the continued blatant violations of an arms embargo by countries present at the Berlin peace talks.', 'Representatives from all parties are expected to meet in Geneva for further talks, though the date is undecided and regional experts have little faith in the situation improving.', 'So far, peace talk efforts havent translated into anything at all, Harchaoui said, stressing the fact that more than 2.2 million civilians are currently living under assault.', 'For the myriad foreign actors in Libya, you think that the war should continue because your preferred actor hasnt won yet, Harchaoui said. And you continue believing in the benefits of brutality, that if the other side is escalating, then you should escalate too, and you should get it done.', 'nSource: CNBC']"

WTI prices finished 15.6% lower for the month, while Brent lost 11.9% this month. Both logged the largest January loss since 1991, according to Dow Jones Market Data.', 'The market is betting that the worst is yet to come, says Manish Raj, chief financial officer at Velandera Energy. There is concern the virus will indirectly lead to economic slowdown in China, as the nation contributes to more than a quarter of the growth in global oil demand, he said. Yet, there is no doubt that actual oil-demand reduction resulting from coronavirus will be temporary at best.', 'He said he thinks that the virus-led fears are overblown, despite the World Health Organization classifying coronavirus as a global emergency. We believe that the market has over-reacted, says Raj. WHO on Thursday designated the outbreak in China a public health emergency of international concern.', 'Whereas we expect the disease to continue to spread over the next few weeks, it is unlikely to impact oil demand to the extent reflected in the dramatic price drop seen this month, says Raj. As psychological fears give way to on-the-ground reality of sustained oil demand, oil prices will revert back to pre-coronavirus levels.', 'Brent crude reached a settlement high of $68.91 in early January before news of the coronavirus really took flight.', 'The decline in oil prices has also led a fall in gasoline prices. Even before any real media coverage of the virus, there was a miserable period of transportation demand in the U.S., points out Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Service.', 'Implied demand for U.S. motor gasoline over the past four weeks as of the week ended on Jan. 24 was at 8.5 million barrels a day, down 4.4% from the same period last year, according to the Energy Information Administration.', 'The average national price for regular gasoline fell to $2.495 a gallon on Jan. 29, below $2.50 for the first time since March, according to data from GasBuddy.', 'DeHaan says given the loss in oil prices, retail gasoline could fall in the $2.30 range before all is said and done, though a downward move probably wont last much more than a few more weeks.', 'As for oil, there is no visible impact to demand just yet, but movements in oil are being driven by fear, says Jay Park, chief executive officer at oil and gas firm ReconAfrica. He notes that there was only a small impact on demand during the SARS outbreak in 2003, but a significant decline in prices.', 'The price impact of the coronavirus could be a drop of about $5 to $10 a barrel in Brent and WTI, he says.

In 2019, Andrew Latham, vice president of global exploration, asked if theres room for explorers in a low-carbon future. In 2020, the energy transition will require explorers to focus on highly advantaged oil and gas. Traditional metrics around value, returns, costs, cycle time and product quality with be joined by growing scrutiny of carbon footprint and ESG credentials.', 'Fund managers will feel even more pressure to justify owning oil and gas shares from their customers. Exploration will feel yet more heat as investors question the need to explore at all given the vast discovered resources. We expect exploration will still have its role to play in allowing companies to add lower-cost barrels to enhance the quality of their portfolios and boost near term profits. Some explorers will build exposure to gas for a lower-carbon future.', 'Traditional and new exploration metrics need not be in conflict. Lower-carbon opportunities very often have lower costs and better economics. The challenge for explorers focused on shorter cycle times is to achieve success at a sufficient scale. Most of the best prospects in mature basins were drilled out years ago. Big, valuable prospects exist mostly in new and emerging plays. Companies will drill in the hope of finding something better than the discovered resources they already have  lower cost and higher margin. New discoveries need to leapfrog to the top of the queue for development. The Majors are likely to remain the prominent participants in high-impact exploration plays. NOCs that are less exposed to investor concerns may also be able to step up their exploration game.', 'Some companies may announce a strategic move away from wildcatting in favour of acquisition-led growth or new energy businesses. Repsol has said it will prioritise value generation over production growth, while focusing on portfolio improvement and cash generation. Repsol sees gas as the fuel for the energy transition and will seek a balanced oil and gas portfolio. Criteria for prospect choice will shift, but oil and gas exploration is not mutually exclusive with a low-carbon future.', 'Some of the European IOCs may give exploration a diminished role as they shift focus to renewables. A diverse inventory of low-breakeven opportunities will be key to thriving as the energy transition unfolds. Companies will hold their discipline and stick to drilling prospects with a clear route to commercialisation. Full cycle returns should be in the range 12-15%, supporting a fourth straight year of exploration value creation.', 'nSource: Wood Mackenzie']"

Two recent events, the September 2019 attacks on Saudi Aramco facilities at Abqaiq and Khurais (which disrupted crude oil volumes) and the January 2020 military operations in Iraq (which did not disrupt crude oil volumes), led to relatively large daily price changes and intraday price movementsmovements within single trading days. Intraday prices of front-month Brent crude oil futures for the two events followed a broadly similar path at first: an upward movement as market participants reacted to the news and a downward movement as new information was incorporated.', 'In the case of the September attacks on Saudi Aramco, the initial price increase was delayed because the event took place over the weekend when the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)the exchange on which Brent futures are tradedwas closed. Consequently, when Brent futures resumed trading, market participants had already had two days to react to the news. Brent crude oil prices opened at $71.57 per barrel (b) at 6:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time (EST) on September 15, 2019, before falling to $67.00/b within 23 minutes of trading and $65.09/b after a further nine hours of trading.', 'Prices following the January 2020 military action in Iraq initially played out similarly: an early large upward movement followed by an eventual downward reversion. But unlike the Aramco attacks, Brent was actively traded while the military operation occurred. Although the precise timing of the January U.S. military operation in Iraq varies by report, it took somewhere between three to five hours for the market to react, reaching $67.44/b by 9:00 p.m. EST.', 'The nature of these two events were different. The attacks on Aramco took physical barrels of oil off the markets. According to Aramco, the attacks on Khurais shuttered the 1.2 million barrel per day (b/d) field for 24 hours. Crude oil processing at the Abqaiq facility was reduced to just 2.0 million b/d on September 17, a small fraction of its estimated capacity of about 7.0 million b/d. The January U.S. military operation in Iraq, however, did not directly affect physical barrels in production, storage, or transit, but it did affect the perceived risk that future barrels could be affected.', 'The magnitude of the price changes following these attacks was relatively large and rare. For the past 29 years, daily Brent crude oil prices changed by less than 2% relative to the previous trading day 74% of the time. The 3.4% change on January 2 following the U.S. military operation in Iraq was larger than 95% of the daily price percentage changes in the past 29 years, and the 12.7% change following the Aramco attacks was the largest daily price percentage change in the past 29 years.', 'The intraday trading range (the difference between a days highest and lowest prices, expressed as a percentage of the closing price) was also relatively large during the two events. From 1990 through 2019, about two-thirds of all trading days had an intraday range smaller than 3% of the closing price. However, the intraday ranges for September 14, 2019, and January 2, 2020, were 10.4% and 4.8%, respectively, of each days closing price.', 'nSource: EIA']"

The West Texas/New Mexico play began 2020 at 396 rigs, but has gained rigs in four straight weeks and increased its count by 19 this month.', 'Its a positive early sign, but its too early to tell much about a turnaround in drilling, said Bob Williams, director of content at Enverus. Its logical in this low-price environment that the first region to add rigs in the new year would be the Permian, which has the lowest breakeven costs in the nation.', 'Given the day rates falling into negative territory in December, its possible that some operators are opportunistically taking advantage of the lower day rate costs by frontloading their drilling spend for the first of the year.', 'The Permian is the largest source of US oil and the nations second-largest gas reservoir, with current production around 4.7 million b/d and 16.6 Bcf/d, respectively.', 'Nationwide, oil- and natural gas-directed rig counts were each down by two, to 677 for oil and 157 for gas.', 'The rig count in seven of the large named shale basins moved up or down by one or two rigs apiece on week, except for the Haynesville Shale of East Texas and Northwest Louisiana and the Williston Basin of North Dakota and Montana, which each lost three rigs.', 'CONCERNS OVER US PRODUCTION GROWTH IN 2020', 'Although the year is off to a good start in the Permian, some Wall Street analysts have concerns over US production growth this year.', 'Indications point to an activity slowdown in domestic shale basins, yet some prominent forecasters and research agencies still see the nations production increasing well over 1 million b/d this year.', 'Drilling permits, which are a good leading indicator to near-term drilling activity, tells a concerning story, according to Evercore ISI analyst James West.', 'We should be looking at December permits around the 5,000 level, but in December 2019 they were 2,300, West said during a Tuesday webinar sponsored by his investment bank. That suggests a pretty weak start to the business for this year.', 'Last months permit total represented the lowest December totals in Evercores data going back to 2008, he said.', 'According to Enverus figures, in the past week total US permits grew by only 28 for a total 535. That increase was small compared to typical weekly movements of at least 100 permits up or down, and often much more.', 'The biggest week-on-week change came in the Permian, up 34 permits to a total 207. Both the Denver-Julesburg Basin in Colorado and the Haynesville Shale of East Texas and Northwest Louisiana each increased permits by 13 on the week, for a total 15 and 23 respectively.', 'The other large named basins were up or down by seven or less this week.', 'nBIG CHANGE IN VIEWS OF DRILLING ECONOMICS', 'Evercore, which puts out a yearly Global E&P Spending Outlook Survey, asks its 250-plus respondents to characterize drilling prospects for their regions. In the December 2018 survey, 3% of participants said they expected economics in their drilling regions to be poor but that number skyrocketed to 30% in December 2019, West said. Clearly, he added, they understand that economics are challenging in the US market.', 'Evercore also projects a roughly 7% drop in US spending for 2020 by E&P operators, with West cautioning a downside risk to that figure.', 'Wells Fargo upstream analyst Nitin Kumar projects domestic capex will be down by 2%, but still projects his coverage universe will show around 8% year-over-year oil production growth of about 210,000 b/d and total production growth of about 7%, or about 500,000 boe/d.', 'We believe most operators are likely [to signal] a moderation of growth and a focus on free cash flow generation in their Q4 conference calls, which just started this week, Kumar said. Those Q4 calls generally provide information on activity programs for the coming year.', 'In the meantime, oil prices have been wobbly this year, dropping from over $60/b to current levels in the low $50s/b.', 'WTI fell in the past week to an average of $53.91/b, down $4.10, according to S&P Global Platts Analytics. WTI Midland dropped $4.14 to $54.63/b, and the Bakken Composite price fell $3.56 to $48.43/b.', 'Decreases were also seen on the gas side.

    "title": "This French Lawsuit Is Making Oil Companies Nervous",
    "content": "['A coalition of French NGOs and local authorities took oil firm Total to court this week for alleged climate inaction, in what is being viewed as a test case for environmentalists in their fight against the fossil fuel giants. Even more broadly, campaigners say, the case could be a tipping point in a global struggle to ensure corporations are held to higher standards of social and environmental responsibility.', 'In the landmark case brought on Tuesday, five French NGOs and fourteen local authorities claim Total is not doing enough to limit carbon emissions to mitigate climate change, despite pledges from the company that it would improve its environmental performance.', 'It is the first time a French company has been taken to court for alleged climate inaction, but only the second case to be brought against Total under the French Duty of Vigilance law, introduced in 2017. The law stipulates that French multinationals are responsible not only for their behavior but for that of their subsidiaries, and requires that firms identify and prevent risks caused by their activities, from human rights abuses to environmental damage.', 'The group, which includes Paris-based civil society groups Sherpa and Notre Affaire  Tous, and authorities such as the Val de Loire region, first challenged Total in 2018 to take measures to reduce its emissions. In response, Total published a plan that the company claimed would lead the company to cut emissions. The group made the decision to press ahead with legal action after decreeing that that plan was not sufficient to address the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement.', 'In the other case, a coalition of NGOs including Friends of the Earth France allege that Totals activities in a protected wildlife park in Uganda are causing environmental harm and have led to human rights violations. Highlighting the case further, in December it was revealed that two witnesses in the case against Total had been subjected to harassment by Ugandan authorities and intimidated by gangs who threatened to break into their homes.', 'Both cases, the campaigners say, are a vital test of the Duty of Vigilance law, which was passed following a years-long struggle by civil society and social justice groups in France.', 'Its really a paradigm shift, said Sandra Cossart, director of Sherpa, a Paris-based NGO set up in 2001 to defend victims of economic crimes. This is the first legislation anywhere in the world that pierces the corporate veil, so its very important that its tested.', 'Speaking to Forbes.com, Cossart said the Duty of Vigilance law means companies have to really think not only about their own risk, but also about the risk for their stakeholders, such as the local communities and environment where they carry out their activities.', 'The aim is to foster a broader environment in which companies have a general obligation to prevent harm caused by their supply chain movement Cossart said is gaining ground across the EU. She drew attention to last years leak of a draft German law that, if passed, could result in fines for companies and even jail time for executives where such firms are found to have shirked corporate social responsibilities.', 'In the French case against Total, the groups claim the firm is responsible for almost 1% of greenhouse gas emissions, something they say the firm should be taking rapid, substantive action to address. And while the preventative nature of the case means it cannot result in financial claims against Total, the NGOs are hoping the judge will rule that the oil firms action on climate change has been unsatisfactory, using the legal system as a lever to actuate a change in behavior.', 'The main objective of the case is to compel Total to adopt a climate strategy consistent with the Paris Agreement, said Paul Mougeolle of climate advocacy group Notre Affaire  Tous. Given that only a 1.5 Celsius scenario with no overshoot and no carbon capture technologies provides us reasonable chances to limit global warming to 2 Celsius, this is the only climate scenario that can be considered as acceptable.', 'Mougeolle conceded that forcing private actors and multinational companies to change, especially when they are not bound by law to respect the Paris Agreement, is extremely difficult. Lawyers have instead to rely on general legal principles to hold corporate actors liable for damages or risk.', 'The French situation is unique thanks to the French Duty of Vigilance law, Mougeolle said. However, other legal principles can be used in other jurisdictions that might have the same effect as the French law.', 'But elsewhere too, fossil fuel companies are facing an increasing number of legal challenges. In the U.S., at least a dozen cases have been brought against oil companies by local authorities hoping to recoup costs incurred by the effects of climate change. The oil majors consider the threat so great they have lobbied for the inclusion of a liability waver in carbon tax legislation to protect them from such claims.', 'Action is also forthcoming across Europe. Environmental group Friends of the Earth Netherlands says it is considering legal action against oil giant Shell, following a legal summons from the charity last year demanding action on climate change. In Norway, Greenpeace and Nature and Youth are taking the Norwegian government to Oslos Court of Appeal for opening up new drilling in the Arctic.', 'As for Total, responding to media on Tuesday, the oil giant said it regretted the French lawsuit. The solutions to responding both to the need for energy sources accessible to all, and to the challenges of climate change, require cooperation among the various stakeholders, a spokesperson said.', 'The case is ongoing.', 'nSource: Forbes']"

Wirth, Chevrons chairman of the board and chief executive officer. We paid $9 billion in dividends, repurchased $4 billion of shares, funded our capital program and successfully captured several inorganic investment opportunities, all while reducing debt by more than $7 billion. Earlier this week, we announced a quarterly dividend increase of $0.10 per share, reinforcing our commitment to growing shareholder returns.', 'Organic capital spending held flat at $20 billion in 2019, further demonstrating our commitment to capital discipline. Within this program, we continued the ramp-up of the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico and progressed our Future Growth Project at the companys 50 percent-owned affiliate, Tengizchevroil, in Kazakhstan. For the first time in the companys history, annual production exceeded 3 million barrels per day of oil equivalent, Wirth added.', 'The company added approximately 494 million barrels of net oil-equivalent proved reserves in 2019. These additions, which are subject to final reviews, are net of reductions associated with the companys decisions to reduce funding for various gas-related opportunities and asset sales.

Additionally, Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC, the companys 50 percent-owned affiliate, announced plans to jointly develop petrochemical projects in the U.S. Gulf Coast and Qatar.', 'In 2019, in addition to flaring and methane emission reduction targets, the company also established new performance goals to reduce net greenhouse gas emission intensity from upstream oil and natural gas production. We entered agreements to increase renewable energy in support of our business and invested in emerging low carbon technologies through our Future Energy Fund and other partnerships, Wirth stated.', 'At year-end, balances of cash, cash equivalents, time deposits and marketable securities totaled $5.7 billion, a decrease of $4.6 billion from the end of 2018.

Worldwide net oil-equivalent production for the full year 2019 was 3.06 million barrels per day, an increase of over 4 percent from 2.93 million barrels per day from the prior year.', 'U.S. upstream recorded a loss of $7.5 billion in fourth quarter 2019, compared with earnings of $964 million a year earlier. The decrease was primarily due to $8.2 billion in impairment charges primarily associated with Appalachia shale and Big Foot. Also contributing to the decrease were lower crude oil and natural gas realizations. Partially offsetting these items were higher crude oil and natural gas production.', 'The companys average sales price per barrel of crude oil and natural gas liquids was $47 in fourth quarter 2019, down from $56 a year earlier.

Production increases from shale and tight properties in the Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico were partially offset by normal field declines in the base business.

The decrease in earnings was partially due to write-offs and impairment charges of $2.2 billion associated with Kitimat LNG and other gas projects, partly offset by a gain of $1.2 billion on the sale of the U.K. Central North Sea assets and the absence of a fourth quarter 2018 asset write-off. Also contributing to the decrease were lower natural gas realizations and volumes, partially offset by lower depreciation expenses. Foreign currency effects had an unfavorable impact on earnings of $476 million between periods.', 'The average sales price for crude oil and natural gas liquids in fourth quarter 2019 was $57 per barrel, down from $59 a year earlier.

The increase was mainly due to higher margins on refined product sales and lower operating expenses.', 'Refinery crude oil input in fourth quarter 2019 increased 6 percent to 975,000 barrels per day from the year-ago period, primarily due to the acquisition of the Pasadena refinery in Texas, partially offset by turnaround activity at the El Segundo, California refinery. Refined product sales of 1.23 million barrels per day were up 2 percent from fourth quarter 2018.', 'International downstream operations earned $184 million in fourth quarter 2019, compared with $603 million a year earlier.

    "content": "['The World Health Organization (WHO) is currently convening a special committee in Geneva, Switzerland where it will likely advise Director-General Dr. Tedros Ghebreyesus to declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV).', 'This news will affect the outlook for the world economy, for commodities markets, and specifically for oil and gas.', 'The Year of the Rat begins with Chinas worst public health crisis in decades. The highly contagious Coronavirus  originating in the central PRC city of Wuhan  has now infected 6,150 and killed 135 across 19 countries, according to John Hopkins University, and the numbers are rising exponentially.', 'The epidemic may prove a fatal blow to the precarious economies of China, the Far East, and beyond. There are few things that the Chinese leadership are more afraid of than global recession, as their legitimacy hinges on continued economic growth.', 'The outbreak comes amidst Chinas 15 day lunar new year celebrations, often referred to as the largest annual migration of humans in the world. Beijing is taking extreme precautionary measures to contain the spread of the illness including quarantines and travel bans.', 'Global markets are not immune either, nor is the energy sector.', 'The S&P 500 ending Monday down 1.6%  its worst session since October. Morgan Stanley announced that the index could drop as much as 5% before the current downturn is over, citing an already overheated market. Many Asian stock markets were closed for the Lunar New Year but those that remained open, including Japans and South Koreas, fell on news of the epidemic.', 'Safe-haven assets like gold and the US dollar saw heightened activity. Spot gold was up 0.4% at $1,5772.29 per ounce, and the greenback is now at a two-month high.', 'Oil markets are not faring much better.', 'Brent crude has hit a 3-month low in the wake of the coronavirus news, and has declined by roughly $7-per-barrel over the last week. It is currently trading around $58.75.', 'Edward Marshall, a commodities trader at Global Risk Management, told the Wall Street Journal I think were close to peak hysteria, so yes the move is justified. Were in full panic mode. Compare that with Brents January high of $70 earlier this month following the assassination of Iranian military leader Qassem Suleimani. American West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures are hovering at $53 per barrel, down $10 from January 06.', 'China is the largest crude importer in the world and has seen its appetite for oil grow at around 5.5% annually, making it an important buyer in the global market. Chinas travel restrictions alone at the height of the Lunar new year could drop domestic demand for jet-fuel around 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) in the first quarter of 2020. The impacts on automotive, rail, ferry, and other oil-based transpiration are still yet to be calculated. Combine this with fears of a slowing Chinese economy and a generally oversupplied market on the heels of record US oil production, and we have a recipe for consistently depressed oil prices.', 'The oil market impact is not lost on OPEC and its allies, who have already met to discuss deeper potential cuts to oil production should the outbreak continue to weigh down prices.', 'Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, Saudi Arabias energy minister insists that there is very little impact on global oil demand, noting that there was also extreme pessimism during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in the early 2000s, but that impact on oil consumption was not significant overall.', 'This is largely true.', 'While 2002-2003 SARS cost the global market upwards of $40 billion dollars, effects on oil markets were short lived. Oil prices did drop by as much as 20% and Chinese oil demand shrank by 2%, but this only lasted for about one quarter. Keep in mind this was the reaction to a much more deadly illness  the SARS mortality rate is above 10%, whereas Coronavirus is closer to 2%3%. The Chinese government is also taking containment measures much more seriously this time around, which should significantly reduce the damage of the virus.', 'For now, oil markets remain weak. Macroeconomic headwinds  from high global inventories to slowing Chinese growth and strong shale production  will continue to weigh on crude prices. And until confidence is restored in the international communitys ability to address this public health crisis, we can expect oil to remain lower still. Stay tuned.', 'nSource: Forbes']"

In the worst-case outcome, entire refineries could close if insurance coverage is inadequate.', 'Insurance rates for property damage and business interruption have increased as much as 100% for some refiners, particularly those that have experienced explosions or fires in the past. Energy companies, which have traditionally bought billions of dollars in insurance, are buying less coverage than in the past.', 'Unexpected refining outages have soared in recent years, surpassing 2,000 incidents in 2019, quadruple 2015 levels, according to Industrial Info Resources, a provider of industrial process and energy market intelligence.', 'With U.S. energy and chemical production at an all-time high, increasingly complex refineries have been running full-tilt, eschewing planned downtime to try to boost profits.', 'The heightened risk comes after a series of high-profile accidents, including several explosions at petrochemical plants in Texas and last years blaze that shut the Philadelphia Energy Solutions refinery.', 'None of the nations large independent refineries, including Valero, Phillips 66 or PBF, would comment on the record for this story.', 'MORE MONEY, MORE PROBLEMS', 'The overall liability to insurers for global refining and petrochemical incidents over the last three years comes to more than $12.5 billion, according to global insurance broker Marsh/JLT. That is more than double the gross premiums paid to insurers, the broker said in a January report.', 'Annual insurance premiums are costly. A refiner worth $1 billion will likely pay $2.5 million or more, according to loss adjusters.', 'Losses are mounting for what is known as business interruption policies, which provide coverage for companies that lose income after operational problems, according to Michael Buckle, managing director of downstream natural resources at rival broker Willis Towers Watson.', 'Last years fire that shut the Philadelphia Energy Solutions refinery could cost $1.25 billion in insured losses alone, though industry sources say PES will likely receive less than that amount from its insurers. Husky Energy is counting on insurers to fund the $400 million rebuild of its refinery in Superior, Wisconsin after a 2018 explosion.', 'Insurance companies with sizable energy exposure such as AIG and CV Starr are responding by offering less overall insurance capacity or reducing exposure, according to insurance industry sources. AIG did not return a request for comment and CV Starr declined comment.', 'Insurers have increased the cost of coverage by 25 percent to 100 percent, depending on a variety of factors including the insurers assessment of risk based on a history of losses. Some refiners are responding by curbing their coverage.', 'Refiners are choosing to buy coverage for only 90, 80, 70% of their total asset value in response to insurance rate hikes, said one senior refining executive, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity.', 'Some refiners also choose to delay the number of days before their business interruption coverage to cut costs, the executive added.', 'CHANGING RISKS', 'Gross crude oil inputs into U.S. refineries reached a record high in 2018 of 17.3 million barrels per day. Refinery utilization rates rose to 93.1% in 2018, the fifth straight annual increase, according to U.S. Energy Department figures.', 'Refining margins were strong through 2018 and 2019, which discourages refiners from shutting down for maintenance.', 'When refinery margins are high, there can be a tendency for refineries to extend turnarounds in order to take advantage of the more profitable environment, said Ian Robb, head of risk engineering at insurance carrier Liberty Specialty Markets.', 'Many U.S. refineries have added units to take advantage of growth in chemicals and plastics demand. Insurance sources said the growing size and complexity of refineries adds to insurance risks, because an interruption in one unit can affect production in several other units, such as petrochemical production.', 'These new interdependencies expose insurers to increasing business interruption risk, said Steffen Halscheidt, global practice lead for oil & gas of Allianz Global Corporate and Specialty.', 'The growth in joint refining ventures and increased acquisition activity can add to risk for insurers, Halscheidt said. Acquisitions that cause workforce turnover can lead to changes to a refinerys operations and the departure of experienced workers.', 'nSource: Reuters (By Laura Sanicola)']"

    "content": "['It is a buyers market for anything related to fossil fuels. Even traditionally the most expensive of them, liquefied natural gas (LNG), is in sharp decline.', 'Other than the recent, and hopefully temporary, viral flu outbreak from China, what is driving LNG prices to the ground? After all, the Phase One China deal is done, so thats not a headwind anymore, and it means more China demand for U.S. LNG.', 'The Iran-inspired launch of World War III is but a memory.', 'As always, its a story of supply and demand. Qatar and Australia are battling for the world leadership in LNG exports. Massive supply of gas out of Russia and the U.S. is doing its bit. These competing, energy-rich juggernauts are one of the main reasons prices have fallen.', 'China has a deal to buy LNG from its own investment in the massive Yamal LNG project in Russia, and is supposed to buy more from the U.S. too. There is plenty of it to go around, and Chinese demand is set to quadruple over the next 15 years as it is fighting pollution caused by coal-fired power plants. U.S. natural gas supply is so large, that storage containers are basically overflowing.', 'Oversupply is bad for energy exporters as margins compress, and not good for their buyers who are stuck with contracts signed at a time when prices were three times higher. Many energy companies are in a tight spot, now that new contracts are being  signed at prices much closer to the cost of production. The energy bear market never sleeps.', 'Buyers Remorse?', 'LNG has become a cost-effective way to get the cleanest burning fossil fuel  natural gas  to an end-user without having to lay miles and miles of pipelines. In some countries, LNG vessels called Floating Storage Regasification Units (FSRU) are connected directly to a natural gas fired power plant set up onshore.  Its become a whole new way to get fuel to utility stations built nearshore.', 'Despite Chinas demand for LNG expected to rise exponentially as it does away with coal as part of its energy matrix, LNG prices arent what they used to be.  LNGs fortunes have completely collapsed from highs of $17 per million British thermal units at their peak in 2012 and again in the summer of 2015 in Asian markets, and are now down to around $5 and change.', 'Blame Russia and the U.S. Theyre swimming in this stuff.', 'When China completely abandoned the U.S. LNG market starting in May last year thanks to the trade war, LNG export prices to Japan, one of the two largest markets for American liquefied gas, went up about a penny. It has been flat since.', 'In one of the more well-known cases of buyer remorse out there, Germanys Siemens and Azerbaijans state owned energy exporter, SOCAR Trading, were awarded a deal to supply electricity and gas to Malta in a competitive bidding process. SOCAR Trading signed a deal in 2015 to supply LNG for a period of 10 years to Enemalta, the islands main utility starting from 2017, with the price being supposedly fixed at 9.4 euros per one million British thermal units for the initial five years.', 'While its higher than where prices are today, back in 2015, $10 was a discount and Malta got a fair price.', 'LNG prices in the U.S., started that year off at more than $17 and ended the year over $15. Prices began to collapse in 2016 and have not recovered much, maybe $0.50 up or down over the last two years.', 'That Malta deal, which involves Shell Oil LNG vessels, has come with numerous issues of foreign intrigue and allegations of abnormal profits  which are probably earned not by LNG suppliers, but by some investment firms which were on the right side of Maltese price hedge.  ', 'Enemalta was basically forced into LNG by the European Union in order to comply with EU environmental standards and address risky delivery from underwater power cables connected to Italy. LNG was not a cheap solution at the time, but it made sense as a way to bring in stable, clean fuel to generate electricity. Factoring in more than 500,000 tons of CO2 equivalent emission that Maltese powerplants were generating annually prior to 2017 LNG era at a current cost of 24.75 euros per ton makes the case for the less-polluting LNG even stronger.', 'Bringing in LNG was all based on lowering carbon emissions and cutting electricity costs, which the Maltese government said it accomplished.', 'Price falls have led to numerous write-downs and failed LNG deals elsewhere around the world.', 'Toshiba bailed on U.S. LNG last spring, selling at a loss to French energy giant Total, S.A.', 'Energy commodities hedging firm Trafigura in Singapore started off 2019 losing upwards of $250 million because of weak LNG prices, but recovered at the end of the year when LNG prices stabilized and oil price volatility worked in their favor.', 'Some in the industry worry that low prices, and negative headlines about LNG political fights, could upend new deals to upgrade nearshore power plants to the clean energy commodity, known as LNG-to-Power.', 'Jamaica has a similar LNG-to-Power facility in a joint venture with U.S. based New Fortress Energy. An FSRU called the Golar Freeze is linked to a regasification plant that sends the gas to two power stations that generate around 300 megawatts of electricity combined. Nearly half of the countrys electric power is derived from U.S. LNG. It used to be mostly oil. ', 'Still, lower prices are not winning over newcomers, especially in developing countries that lack the infrastructure for traditional power generation.', 'For example, Kenya said it wanted an offshore LNG unit built back in 2011. They issued a tender for a large 700 megawatt project five years ago, then cancelled it. Its gone nowhere since.', 'South Africas PetroSA has been studying LNG since 2012. Last year, the state-owned freight logistics firm Transnet says it wants to launch a tender next year for South Africas first LNG import terminal, in hopes to have it ready by 2024.', 'LNG-to-power projects, despite beating most other fossil fuel-based generation, are criticized due to their novelty and complexity. Government bureaucracies and politicians are playing it safe, afraid of going against the oil and coal lobbies. Legislative and regulatory frameworks to use LNG are still missing. As a result, China remains in the drivers seat on the demand side. Just as important, China has the capacity to legislate long term without the risk of a political opposition using energy deals as a weapon against an incumbent.', 'U.S. And Russia: LNG Bears', 'FUTURE OF ENERGY', 'nBrian Gilvary, chief financial officer of BP, says the energy bear market is here to stay.  [+] 2018 BLOOMBERG FINANCE LP', 'nThe good news is that energy prices are going to be lower for longer. The bad news is that consumers in underserved markets and energy companies may suffer. Investors hate this sector. The SPDR Energy Select (XLE) exchange traded fund is down 11.5% in 12 months, 23.9% over the last two years, and 30.9% over the last five.', 'Markets are total bears for U.S. energy stocks, while China and Russian energy stocks like Novatek, Gazprom and CNOOC, all major LNG players, are doing better.', 'British Petroleums CFO Brian Gilvary said on a recent conference call on BP earnings that LNG looks bearish for the next two years. BPs stock price has underperformed the FSTE 100 over the last five years.', 'The UK is 105% full on LNG storage right now. Europe is 100% full on LNG, he said on the call.', 'U.S. LNG has the lowest cost of production in the world, better than Russia and better than Australia which is getting in on the game in order to serve the Chinese. But beyond China, Gilvary thinks it will be hard for companies to find new markets.', 'Youre probably looking at the back end of 2021 before you start seeing this massive supply overhang clear out and then we will have LNG projects coming onstream in Australiawhich is simply going to exacerbate the (over supply) situation, he said.', 'LNG has changed how gas is traded around the world. It has made it a global, rather than a regional, commodity.', 'Until more LNG-receiving terminals start getting built as an alternative to long pipelines, then its China or bust. LNG exporters need more demand from new markets.', 'Meanwhile, buyers who locked-in at higher rates will continue feeling political pressure points, like in Malta, Pakistan and others. Also expected are big players like Toshiba to cut their losses in what has become the longest running energy bear market since the Great Recession.', 'nSource: Forbes']"

    "title": "Potential US Fracking Ban Would Have Little Immediate Impact On Nationwide Oil And Gas Production",
    "content": "['Recent analysis conducted by Rystad Energy suggests that if the fracking activity were to be eliminated on federal acreage  in accordance with a stated policy goal of at least one presidential candidate  the result would be a widespread shift of capital from federal to private and state-owned acreage in a bid to replace the lost oil volumes. In other words, a potential fracking ban would likely have a little immediate impact on nationwide oil and gas production figures.', 'Even in the long-term, the impact might be quite negligible as seen from the greater industry perspective, says Artem Abramov, Head of Shale Research at Rystad Energy. However, the effects of such a ban could have stronger negative effects on one key shale producing region in particular  the New Mexico portion of the prolific Permian Delaware Basin.', 'New Mexico has more than half of the most prospective property under federal acreage, in Eddy and Lea counties. While there is federally-owned land across the nation and in each individual state, the distribution is not uniform and is generally more concentrated in the west, especially in the Rockies and along the West Coast. There are 10 states in the US (excluding Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico) with more than 20,000 square miles of land owned by the federal government, of which three states can be viewed as important contributors to domestic hydrocarbon production  Wyoming, New Mexico, and Colorado  each of which has between 40,000 and 50,000 square miles of federal land.', 'New Mexico has the highest relative contribution to activity on federal acreage, where the share of federal lands has been fluctuating at around 60% in recent years. Both Wyoming and North Dakota saw the share of federal acreage, relative to total activity, at close to 25% in the three-year period from 2017 through 2019, whereas horizontal activity on Colorados federal land is insignificant, says Abramov.', 'Oil production from federal lands surpassed 1 million bpd during the summer of 2019, doubling over the most recent two-year period. New Mexico accounted for the largest share of oil production growth in 2018-2019, as shown in the chart above. In North Dakota, federal lands represent only 6% of the overall territory, but much of that acreage is concentrated within the core Bakken shale basin; this explains the states high contribution of production from federal property.', 'Total gas production on federal lands in the US Lower 48 excluding GoM exhibits a lower growth rate, largely due to the vast gas production base coming from western and central Wyoming. Still, gas production increased by about 50% between the second half of 2016 and the third quarter of 2019. Associated gas output from Delaware New Mexicos federal acreage was a key growth driver, yet significant additional contributions came from the Utica Shale in Ohio.', 'In Delaware New Mexico, the federal land share of total activity varies significantly depending on the operator. For the largest operator in Delaware New Mexico  EOG Resources  only 40% of the wells that it fracked since 2017 were on federal acreage. Other operators are more intertwined with the federal government: between 63% and 82% of Oxy, Devon and Concho completions in Delaware NM were on federal land. Two other big operators with a low share of fracking on federal lands are Matador Resources and Marathon Oil, both with 25-27% of completions on federal land. Cimarex and Chevron exhibit the highest recent focus on federal land in New Mexico, with 87-90% of activity happening there.', 'A majority of significant Delaware New Mexico operators can maintain activity levels at the current pace (average of 2018-2019) for more than 20 years. If federal acreage is no longer accessible, the inventory size would decrease, but we would still see 10+ years inventory at the current pace for most operators, and as much as 19+ years for about half of the group. Needless to say, most of these companies have equally commercial opportunities on the Texas side of the Delaware basin, where federal acreage is practically non-existent, states Abramov.', 'From a valuation perspective, a fracking ban would theoretically affect the full acreage potential and hence negatively impact the total portfolio value for some E&Ps. Rystad Energy research indicates that as much as $36.5 billion in upstream asset value could be lost in Delaware New Mexico alone. Even if a fracking ban were to be implemented on federal lands, it is our view that this loss would not be entirely reflected in market movements. This is partly because the market currently puts little value on the long-term acreage potential, and also because the loss in value of federal acreage will result in front-loaded development of private and state-owned acreage. In practice, the loss in federal acreage value will be absorbed by the gain in the value of other acreage, concludes Abramov.', 'nSource: Rystad Energy']"

Its links with China have been an important part of the regions development in recent years. As headlines have laid bare the spread of the Wuhan coronavirus, global oil prices fell as low as $58.35 a barrel in early trading on 27 January. This steep climb-down, from a high of $68.9 a barrel on 6 January, demonstrates how demand-side considerations in Asia and particularly China  and the threat of a potential pandemic in the region  have risen to the fore.', 'Coming amid the shutdown of Libyan oil production and a fresh missile attack on the US embassy in Baghdad, the coronavirus-linked drop in oil prices illustrates the now perennial underweighting of Middle East risk.', 'Repeated incidents over the past 12 months have caused only brief spikes in the oil price, with little lasting impact. Despite the geopolitical situation, prices have remained depressed on the back of underlying assumptions about supply and demand conditions. By historic standards, oil prices have stayed low amid the Middle Easts heightened tensions, which have brought the region the closest to open military conflict this side of a decade.', 'The market response to the health crisis in China is highly reactionary in nature, given that it is not yet clear how deadly the disease will be and what the long-term impacts on the Chinese economy and commodities could be.', 'Beijings measures to curtail the spread of the virus will undoubtedly impact economic activity and growth in the short-term, but it is far more speculative to make assumptions about the longer-term impacts. What has been made overwhelmingly clear, however, is the degree to which oil prices are being driven by demand-side indicators, and the extent to which effects on the Chinese economy in particular are able to influence oil prices over and above destabilising events in the Middle East.', 'nSource: GlobalData']"

In October, the US exported 1.19 million b/d of refined products to Mexico, according to the most recent US Energy Information Administration data.', 'However, there seems to be a disconnect between what the government is saying and what the government is doing, said Auers.', 'On the one hand, they are saying yes we are open to investment, but at the same time they are not making it easy for companies that are already trying to do business, Auers said.', 'Mexico should take advantage of the abundance of light crude in the US and build infrastructure to bring it to feed its refineries, which are currently using heavy crude, Auers said.', 'Pemex has long used the strategy of running its refineries with heavy oil when it runs short of lighter grades, although it produces high levels of fuel oil.', 'Mexico has announced it will build an $8 billion refinery to meet its refined products demand and reduce its dependency on imports.', 'Someone bought into the idea that Mexico should increase its ability to produce its own gasoline and diesel instead of importing it from the US, but I dont understand why, said Sarah Emerson, managing partner at ESAI Energy, during the same panel.', 'Its a tough reach to bring on a brand new refinery and be competitive, Emerson said.', 'What the industry needs is one or two good stories, in the upstream or midstream, to attract investors, said Hussein Tuesday.', 'There is around $1.7 trillion of cash in the hands of the private equity firms around the world ready to be deployed, and part of that could come to Mexico.', 'Our hope is that there will be an investment opportunity in Mexico.

The more production lags in Libya, the more positive it will be for Nigerian oil, a third trader said, adding that the lighter grades such as Agbami and Akpo would see comparatively more support than other Nigerian grades due to their similarity to Libyan crude.', 'The Nigerian market has started to trade March-loading barrels, however, some more prompt February-loading cargoes were still available that could fill demand.

The stranglehold on Iranian oil could not be tighter.', 'The message is clear from Washington, buy oil from these guys and risk punishment.', 'Last week, the State Department imposed sanctions on Chinese company Shandong Qiwangda Petrochemical; Hong Kong-based Triliance Petrochemical, and Hong Kong-based Jiaxiang Industry for buying or transporting oil products from Iran, finished in dollars.', 'They also hit two of the executive officers of the companies identified above, Ali Bayandarian, managing director of Triliance Petrochemical, and Zhiqing Wang, chairman and legal representative of Shandong Qiwangda Petrochemical Co., Ltd.', 'One can argue that China is also on Washingtons hit list, so it makes them an easy target. But the United Arab Emirates is not. They are a huge buyer of U.S. defense contractor products and services. But UAE firm Beneathco is now sanctioned for working with Irans National Oil Company. That company is seen as a key source of cash for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force, designated a terrorist group by the U.S.', 'Quds was once commandeered by General Qasem Soleimani, killed by a U.S. drone strike in December setting off hyperventilating remarks by newly minted Iran experts that President Trump was starting World War III.', 'If economic war is akin to the conventional use of weapons and arms, then Iran is under siege. Its economy has been in a recession for the past two years. The World Bank said it may flatline this year, which is better than contracting. But that was before the latest sanctions squeeze. This move puts other countries on notice and is another major blow to the Iranian economy.', 'It gets worse.', 'nOn January 10, Trump announced sanctions that went beyond oil and gas and now targeted construction, mining, manufacturing and textile goods. Imports of Iranian goods into the U.S. have fallen to zero. Exports are all humanitarian goods, such as medicines and medical equipments.', 'Consecutive administrations have attempted to bleed the Iranian economy of funds believed to be used to finance terrorist operations around the world. Going after sectors never hit before is part of the Trump Administrations strategy of maximum pressure.', 'This latest round further constrains what people are able to do with Iran, says Alan Enslen, head of Baker Donelsons International Trade and National Security Practice. The prohibitions on what U.S. companies and individuals can do has been a line in the sand drawn long ago. The most significant part of this latest executive order is an expansion of restrictions on what non-U.S. parties can do, he says about so-called secondary sanctions.', 'Foreign companies and the lenders they do business with may, or may not, be in trouble for doing business with Iran. This includes export business, and domestic business. If youre DHL delivering fabric samples to Iran, the onus is on DHL for shipping a product now under the sanctions policy of the United States. Corporate lawyers will interpret things their own way and take risks as they see fit.', 'Nobody likes this, especially in Europe where companies in the energy space have had relationships with Iran for years, says Enslen.', 'It may even be legal to do business in some sectors with Iran; think healthcare related goods, for instance. But will a bank like BNP Paribas, once fined a whopping $8.9 billion for sanctions violations in Iran, be willing to take on that risk?', 'Business with Iran has decreased since Trump pulled out of the nuclear agreement made under the Obama Administration. Many companies around the world assumed sanctions would be lifted fully on Iran if that nuclear deal remained in place. It never did. Sanctions on oil remained. But most business was not banned. Companies felt comfortable with the risks they were taking in buying Iranian oil, or working in Irans oil market domestically.', 'But when Trump pulled the plug on the nuke deal, all the sanctions returned, new ones were added within months, and the European companies that thought all was well on their end were caught between Tehran and Washington.', 'Given the choice  do business with Iran or disavow the U.S. financial system  Ive never seen anyone chose Iran, says Enslen.', 'Earlier this month, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke about the Iran policy post-Soleimani at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. He said the goal was to deprive the regime of resources it needs to perpetrate its malign activity around the world', 'Germany, France and Italy have put travel bans on a company called Mahan Air, a privately owned Iranian airline that supposedly ferries weapons to battle zones.', 'Last year, Argentina and the United Kingdom both added Iranian government backed Hizballah to their list of international terrorist groups.', 'Pompeo went on to say that the U.S. wants to squeeze the last dollar out of the last drop of Iranian crude.', 'The economic pressure that we have put in place cut off roughly 80 percent of Iranian oil revenues, he told a gathering at Stanford. We are determined to get at that last 20 percent.', 'nSource: Forbes']"

The fear premium just before the invasion had peaked, then suddenly it dropped off quite rapidly when it realized that, though Iraqi production was affected, OPEC members rallied and pumped enough oil.', 'The novel coronavirus also appears to be less severe, she said, noting that the virus has not spread the way SARS did outside of China.', 'No upside catalysts for oil', 'nWhile Hari called the fall in oil prices premature and overdone, she also said there were bearish leanings in the market before the outbreak began.

The AEO2020 Reference case, which serves as a baseline for exploring the effects of different assumptions about the economy, policy, and technology, projects renewables to be the fastest-growing source of electricity generation through 2050, driven by continued declines in the capital costs for solar and wind technologies. Slow growth in U.S. energy consumption, as a result of continued increases in energy efficiency, and technologically enabled growth in domestic oil and natural gas production lead the United States to remain a net energy exporter through 2050.', 'The AEO2020 Reference case projects domestic energy demand to grow 0.3% per year on average through 2050, slower than the average annual growth of 1.9% in U.S. gross domestic product. This projection is largely driven by continued increases in energy efficiency in the end-use sectors. Gains in appliance efficiency in the residential and commercial sectors, increases in efficiency of new capital equipment in the industrial sector, and increases in fuel economy partially offset the growth in the number of households, industrial activity, and vehicle-miles traveled.', 'The AEO2020 Reference case also projects the share of U.S. electricity generation from renewable sources to double from 19% of total generation in 2019 to 38% by 2050. Solar contributes the most to the growth, more than tripling from 14% of total renewable generation in 2019 to 46% by 2050. Although coal and nuclear generation decline through the mid-2020s as a result of capacity retirements, their generation stabilizes over the longer term as the more economically viable plants remain in service.', 'At the same time, the United States continues to produce historically high levels of crude oil and natural gas. In the AEO2020 Reference case, U.S. crude oil production continues to set annual records through the mid-2020s and remains near 14.0 million barrels per day (b/d) through the mid-2040s. EIA projects U.S. dry natural gas production will reach 45 trillion cubic feet by 2050. The continued development of tight oil and shale gas resources supports growth in these fuels.', 'With the production growth outpacing growth in domestic consumption of crude oil, petroleum products, and natural gas, U.S. net exports of these fuels increase. In the Reference case, the United States will continue to export more petroleum and other liquids than it imports, with a peak at more than 3.8 million barrels per day (b/d) in the early 2030s before gradually declining to 0.2 million b/d in 2050 as domestic consumption slowly rises. U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports and natural gas pipeline exports to Canada and to Mexico continue to rise through the 2020s before flattening for the remainder of the projection period.', 'After falling in the first half of the projection period, U.S. energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions resume modest growth in the 2030s, but they remain lower than 2019 levels through 2050. Until about 2030, U.S. energy-related CO2 emissions decrease as a result of retirements of coal-fired generation capacity and corresponding changes in the mix of fuels consumed by the electric power sector. After 2030, increases in energy demand in the other sectorspredominantly transportation and industrialresult in increases in emissions.', 'EIAs AEO2020 also includes eight side cases that show the effects of changing key model assumptions, including two new cases (High Renewables Cost and Low Renewables Cost) that explore the uncertainty of future costs of renewable power generation technologies on U.S. electricity markets. The Issues in Focus article to be released later today with the AEO2020 discusses the results of these new cases.', 'nSource: EIA']"

I asked our analysts  across energy transition, power and renewables, macro oils, petrochemicals, gas, upstream, corporate, economics, metals and mining  to imagine what 2030 looks like. Heres what they see.', 'Technology  brave new world', 'nThe world is decarbonising, the nascent technologies of 2020 now mainstream. Energy storage, at scale, is crucial in balancing a power market dominated by intermittent solar and wind. New generation cobalt-light, high-nickel lithium-ion batteries underpin an industrialised electric vehicle market in which China leads manufacturing and dominates the supply chain. One in four light vehicle sales globally is an EV while autonomous EVs are starting to take off in the mass market.', 'Free surplus renewable generation supports green hydrogen pilot projects, threatening fossil fuels stranglehold on high-intensive industries, including steel and cement. Hydrogen is emerging as a potentially viable solution for residential and commercial space heating. Industrial-scale carbon capture and storage opens the prospect of prolonging fossil fuels life in markets where theres access to suitable spent oil or gas reservoirs. Among emerging technology bets are bio-methane (net-zero emissions gas), algae (low-emissions biofuels) and biotechnological advances in the food chain that disrupt agriculture.', 'Smart cities: an electrifying experience', 'nCities in China, California, Japan and Europe lead the way on decarbonisation and how we consume energy  a sneak peek into what a 2050 world looks like. In these cities, smart homes give us complete control over energy consumption and efficiency. Smart systems connect wirelessly to appliances and control domestic ambience  cooking, heating, lighting  cost effectively, choosing when to buy power from the grid, sell it or store it.', 'The power systems in these cities are decentralised  distributed generation dominated by renewables, supported by grid-edge technologies, such as energy storage and EV charging. Gas is still in the generation mix in a back-up capacity. Universally, massive investment is being made in last-mile distribution to meet steeply rising power demand.', 'New energy and fossil fuel resilience', 'nSigns of sweeping change are evident, though the energy mix globally hasnt changed much. Fossil fuels, even coal, are proving resilient  the only option in many developing economies to readily meet rising energy demand. But zero- and low-carbon energy in power and other sectors are in the ascendancy as costs fall.', 'Efficiency gains and policy focused on consumption  everything from carbon taxes on fossil-fuel-based fuels and goods to subsidised public transport  are dampening fossil fuel demand. The decline in coal demand is accelerating; electrification has brought global oil demand growth close to peak, with the developed world already in decline. Gas demand is the most resilient among fossil fuels, with LNG exceeding piped export volumes. Gas growth, though, is coming under threat from new technologies like hydrogen.', 'Oil and gas investment, ESG and finance', 'nOil and gas products still support the global economy. But the industry is different: upstream is low cost (Middle East and Russia), low risk, lower carbon  and low employment. Investment focuses on brownfields. Digitalisation, artificial intelligence, nanotechnology and supercomputing are enhancing recovery, maybe even discovery  though exploration has largely ceased. Environmental pressures have intensified, severely limiting finance availability for oil, perhaps gas. Those banks still prepared to lend insist on ever-higher hurdle rates and faster payback.', 'With the Permian now ex-growth, underinvestment in global upstream and higher finance costs increase the risk of oil price spikes. Downstream is closing capacity in OECD countries as demand declines. Refining assets are increasingly concentrated in growth markets (Asia), growth segments (petchems) and low-emissions refined products that incorporate biofuels.', 'Corporate landscape', 'nThe industry has consolidated to cut costs so there are fewer players. Strategies have shifted, and the lines have blurred between oil and gas and utilities. The Majors, other large IOCs and a few NOCs have morphed into energy providers, taking power global. Power  generation, grid edge, even retail customers  is a significant, fast-growing core business built by acquisitions as well as organic investment. Some have even taken the plunge into the supply chains of cobalt, lithium, nickel and copper  the metals of energys future.', 'Legacy upstream and downstream still dominate in most integrated companies portfolios, but as a (shrinking) cash cow, with investment limited. A few pure oil and gas low-cost Middle East NOCs are thriving. Many others, IOCs and NOCs, struggle to adapt. Value-driven niche players, perhaps privately backed, make hay for a time as the wider industry churns assets and positions towards low carbon.', 'nSource: Wood Mackenzie']"

    "content": "['The investment case for oil companies has been under attack recently. Climate change activists know that the dividends paid by the largest of these companies are among the most lucrative and stable over time, of any payers in the marketplace today. Further, they know these attacks will receive wide coverage precisely because of the criticality of the dividend stability to these companies stock price. Its a two-fer for these folks. The only thing isit isnt true.', 'Dividends are the principle reason to own the shares of the major oil companies. The dividend payouts these days are yielding 4-7 percent, thanks to the depressed equity valuations of the oil majors. As you will note, this is well above most other options, like U.S. 10-year treasury notes as an example. Any threat to the dividend will absolutely bring a dog diving under the bed in a thunderstorm response from the typical investor. They will push the sell button lickety-split. And, of course, thats just the response hoped for. Smart investors in these companies will pause just a moment for a second opinion. Perhaps one with some facts behind it, like you will read in this article.', 'nSustainable forms of energy are all the rage these days. You cant watch a money show without hearing from the bloviator de jour about how Green Energy will replace traditional hydrocarbon sources in about ten-years or so. Among these worthies are the CEOs of major institutional holders, like Blackrock or Norways Sovereign Wealth Fund and other large banking and fund management companies. These leaders will freely admit they are moving toward divestiture due to the political narratives regarding climate change, stating it as a fact. The truth is they have no rational basis, but are rather yielding to the out-spoken minority stake-holders, who are demanding action on their part to divest dirty energy sources.', 'As noted above in this article, we will take a closer look at the investbility of some of the biggest dividend payers on the planet. In doing this we will look past the splashy headlines that the CEOs of these companies garner in watering-holes like Davos. Get ready for some real analysis, and prepare to sleep well at night knowing your retirement portfolio will be there when you need it.', 'Climate change propaganda and misinformation', 'The stimulus for this article was an article I chanced on by a climate change crisis group called the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, or IEEFA.', 'A little research finds this is an organization that takes its mission as:', 'The Institutes mission is to accelerate the transition to a diverse, sustainable and profitable energy economy.', 'Hmmm, what the heck are they talking about, you may wonder? One thing is for sure they have an agenda against the petroleum industry, making their conclusions suspicious to this reader. Now, lets understand information can be completely accurate and still be misleading.', 'nI havent gone back and fact-checked any of the information linked from this IEEFA article. Instead, I did my own investigation using company documents to see if I could justify my faith in the companies whose viability was being questioned. My results will be revealed in the next section of this article.', 'Like most investigations that start with an agenda, the IEEFA article contains a grain of truth. This grain helps to anchor the disinformation that follows. To wit: many oil companies have outspent cash flows maintaining dividends over the time period measured.', 'nIEEFA course provides no context here, just raw data. This can be misleading. In the discussion that follows, we will provide some context to help evaluate the concerns that we really have.', 'What is the trend for the future? Are our investments safe, as safe as any stock investment can be, and are the dividends many of us rely upon to maintain our retired standard of living, likely to continue?', 'Thats what I want to know, and I expect if you are reading this article, you do as well.', 'Reasons why super major stocks will remain investible', 'nLet me offer the following points that should give you more confidence in the ability of these companies to continue earning your trust and your capital on into the future.', 'Dividend Payout Patios (Net income/dividend)', 'nRatios below 1:1 are considered safe, classically, but safe is a relative term. Over the past five years all of these companies with the exception of Total (NYSE:TOT) bonds sales have been the way they covered the dividend. Currently, they are in the range of or slightly above historical sub 1:1 levels.', 'The context lacking in the IEEFA article, denoted by the hump in the middle of the chart above, represents the full impact of the lower for longer oil price. The impact of these lower price realizations, and the fact that these companies were also slow to whittle down their capex budgets, meant that the dividend was being supported by borrowing.', 'So what is the truth, if that IEEFA article is so offbase? What are these companies telling us about coverage projections going forward? Lets look at a few cash flow projections from this cohort.', 'Based on a Brent price of $60, Shell, (NYSE:A) (NYSE:RDS.B) projects free cash flows to rise from around $28 bn in 2020 to about $35 bn by 2025. With current obligations of about $16 bn for dividends, that leaves an increasingly fat amount for stock repurchases.', 'Dividend coverage should improve consistently over this time and shareholders should lose no sleep. The check will be in the mail.', 'ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) recently has struggled to maintain a sub-1:1 cash flow to dividend ratio as my chart above shows. Currently, it is well above that and the current 5.15 percent yield notes the markets dissatisfaction with that situation. That will change and soon.', 'With the Liza field coming on line and with break-even costs in the $30/bbl range, as much $5 bn of free cash could be generated from that project alone. XOM is on track to produce a million barrels a day from the Permian by 2025 with BE costs as low as $20/bbl. Bank America Merrill Lynch recently put out a bullish call on XOM with a price target based on increasing cash flow from these projects of $100/share.', 'Chevron (NYSE:CVX) is a dividend champion that has been increasing its dividend in recent years and lowering capex resulting in its current 0.53 coverage ratio. Market sages will tell you that the safest dividend is one thats just been raised. CVX consistently ranks as one of the best-managed companies and has a project portfolio that will keep profits gushing in years to come. It grew cash flow by 50 percent YoY in 2018, and current managements fiscal discipline should maintain that trend over the next few years. It currently covers capex and dividends with a $52 oil price, and has been buying back stock currently at a clip of $4 bn per annum.', 'This has turned into a long article so I will skip the same type of analysis for (NYSE:BP) and (NYSE:TOT) in terms of project portfolios and capex restraint. All of these companies have redesigned their upstream projects to be cash flow positive with oil prices much lower than they are now. In this core group of Super Major energy companies, investors should sleep well at night.', 'Stock buybacks. These companies are all buying back billions of dollars of their common stock every year. This decreases the total dividend payout, and makes the dividend safer for each remaining share of stock. In the past year, Shell has bought back about $12 bn worth of its stock, on a 2018 commitment of $25 bn by 2020. Shell recently announced that weaker than expected oil prices might drag this out a bit. That knocked the stock price down a bit, which I saw as a buying opportunity.', 'Shell will buy another ~$3 bn in Q-1 of 2020. Do investors care if this happens by the end of 2020 or takes a quarter or two more? They shouldnt. On the plus side, oil prices might rise more than anticipated and share repurchases could be accelerated. As you may have noted things can change rapidly in the oil market.', 'Debt reduction. This is a priority for all of these companies and is being funded through free cash and assets sales with the proceeds going to debt reduction. Portfolio high grading is underway. Its not perfect and sometimes it one step back for every two steps forward.', 'Picking on Shell once again, the official target for debt to capital is 25 percent. Moving toward that goal for most of 2018, the company has taken a stutter-step higher to the 28 percent range. Part of this was due to lease costs hitting the balance sheet in late 2018. There can be no doubt that lower than anticipated oil prices has slowed this process.', 'Shell management reminds us of this regularly during the analyst calls. What matters to us is that they consider it a matter of the utmost priority. Ben Van Beurden comments in response to an analysts question regarding the timing of stock buybacks and debt reduction:', 'nSo, very clearly, we are still completely intent on buying back $25 billion of shares and we are also completely committed to strengthening the balance sheet by bringing debt down.', 'Diversifying the product mix to include Green Energy.Green energy or sustainable energy sources is the path to the future, or so we are repeatedly told. It is only prudent for the big oil companies to seed research and startup companies in this area. So far, none of these efforts have reached the level where they are accounted for separately on the balance sheet however, with the notable exception of LNG.', 'Whether its biodiesel in Brazil, or electrical charging stations in the UK, or wind farms in the Permian, or LNG, efforts are being put forth by them all. Whether any of these can turn a profit down the road remains to be seen. For now, it is enough that the exercise is underway, as it raises their ESG profile.', 'Investing in new technologies. These companies all have and are developing more AI expertise with big data. The Shells and BPs of the world all generate huge amounts of data every day. Terabytes upon terabytes of it daily. Historically, the resources to manage this information efficiently just did not exist. Now it does these companies are moving rapidly to integrate and perhaps monetize this technology.', 'AI can help find those cost reductions by tackling a range of problems. Its deployment in upstream operations could yield collective savings in capital and operating expenditures of $100 billion to $1 trillion by 2025, according to a 2018 report by PricewaterhouseCoopers. Most companies declined to discuss their exact spending on AI.', 'nAs these resources are deployed in remote locations or refineries, costs will come down as the article quoted above notes.', 'Risks', 'nOil prices carry the key risk to dividend sustainability over the near and medium term. As weve seen in a plus-$50 environment they can all make money and cover their dividends.', 'West Texas Intermediate- WTI, has fluctuated wildly in price over the last 10 years. For the last four however, it has been above $50 except for a couple of very brief periods. Im ok with economics built on $50 oil.', 'Environmental and Social Governance-ESG, risk must now be built in to the risk profile in owning these stocks. It can be thought of as replacing the old exploration risk that modern technology has reduced dramatically. When I entered the oilfield 40+ years ago, dry holes- ones with no hydrocarbon shows, ran as high as 85 percent of the exploration wells drilled. Today that ratio has more than flipped with dry holes being a rarity. Just what is the extent of this risk?', 'Your takeaway', 'nThese are the companies that hold the trillions of retirement dollars from 401Ks and Roth IRAs. They are invested in the big oil companies for yield, stability, and to an extent growth. I dont mind keeping company with the tens of thousands institutional holders of XOM and the other companies weve been discussing.', 'The key takeaways for you as an investor in the big oil company dividend payers is that they are all on track to deliver the cash flow that underpins the dividends they are committed to pay.', 'As investors, there is no doubt we need to keep an eye on this ESG divestiture movement. For the short term it represents little threat to the value of our investments. It is worth noting however, the Norwegian Sovereign Wealth fund has endorsed companies like Shell and BP expressly. In a recent Financial Times article Norways Finance Minister, Siv Jensen commented that:', 'Ms Jensen said the largest oil and gas majors were given a reprieve because Norway believed such groups were in all likelihood the ones that would make the main investments in renewable energy in the future.', 'You have a responsibility here as well. That is the task of vetting what you read and take stock in. Ask yourself as read if there is an under-lying agenda that is masked behind the seemingly objective and forthright information being presented?', 'Weve shown here that information presented this way can be completely factual and still be misleading. Potentially with portfolio damaging consequences if acted upon. Caveat emptor! Protect your wealth!', 'nSource: Bay Street']"

But acting illegally by blocking Libyan oil production will just lead to the further impoverishment of the Libyan state and erosion of the rule of law.', 'Earlier this month, forces loyal to the eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA), which is under the leadership of general Khalifa Haftar, seized Libyas oil export terminals along the southern shores of the Mediterranean as well as some oil fields and pipelines. The move came after Haftar recently escalated a years-long campaign to capture the capital of Tripoli, which sits in the west of the country and is the seat of the United Nations-backed Government of National Accord (GNA).', 'The NOC and Sanalla have been at pains to act and be seen as a neutral party in the long-running conflict between the GNA and the LNA, since supporting either side could invite retaliatory strikes on oil infrastructure. Oil production has suffered intermittent disruptions, but has recently remained out of the line of fire.', 'Libyas crude exports have already dropped to just 262,000 barrels per day and could fall below 100,000 barrels per day, Sanalla earlier told Bloomberg TV, down from around 1.2 million barrels per day. Potentially more damaging, Libya has scant storage capacity, forcing NOC to halt much oil production and leave crude oil stuck in pipelines, where they could cause corrosion.', 'Blockades of Libyas Brega, Ras Lanuf, Hariga, Zueitina, and Sidra ports are costing the country $55 million dollars per day in lost revenue, NOC has said. Without that money, Libya may not be able to move ahead with plans to invest in new oil infrastructure. We were told that NOC will not receive the requested budget it needs for its ambitious programme to expand oil production, said Sanalla at Chatham House.', 'Libyas civil war is the poisoned fruit of a successful NATO-backed campaign in 2011 to oust dictator Muammar el-Qaddafi.

Developments in the US-China trade dispute, geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, global recession fears and US shale versus Opec cuts all exert a powerful influence on investor confidence in the oil markets.', 'The pressure cooker of the US-China trade dispute has cooled off after the phase one deal was signed, possibly avoiding further tariff hikes and trade obstacles in the near future and easing investor sentiment. If there are more signals that the negotiating teams are closer to a comprehensive and full trade agreement in the first quarter, its reasonable to expect more support for oil prices because the gigantic economies of the US and China would get some breathing space to recover from the damage to their manufacturing and agricultural sectors. This is looking increasingly unlikely if we consider the US elections coming up in November and President Donald Trumps comments that he is not in a hurry to conclude a final trade deal with China.', 'Positive results from a boost in confidence may not set in until later in the year. Demand for crude may pick up during the course of the year because of a recovery in the manufacturing and agricultural sectors, both main drivers of demand.', 'In the last nine months of 2019, US manufacturers and hauliers suffered a sharp decline in growth which impacted demand for petroleum products like diesel. Diesel consumption fell 3.4 per cent in the period August to October 2019 on an annual basis, meaning an overall decline in demand. In addition, although the first phase of a trade deal is signed, China has not yet lifted the 5 per cent tariff on US oil imports.', 'Even Chinas demand for oil weakened slightly in 2019 to 9.5 per cent growth in imports versus 10.1 per cent the year before.', 'Most institutions such as Opec and the International Monetary Fund are forecasting lower demand for oil in 2020 but there is a chance for demand to pick up if the US and China seal the second deal by the end of the year and give trade relations a fresh start. The impact of the trade disputes on sentiment shouldnt be underestimated because the prevailing mood since the trade disputes started in summer 2018 has been uncertainty which in turn dampens investment and curbs risk appetite.', 'Opec deepened its supply cuts at the end of 2019, a period in which the US Shale industry reported a higher rate of bankruptcies in what appears to be an unsustainable level of growth given lower global oil prices. Already, the US market buys domestic oil products and energy imports from overseas have fallen to 11 per cent, the lowest since 1957. Conceivably, the domestic industry could satisfy 100 per cent of US oil demand within the next year, leaving US shale with the question what next?', 'The US is now a serious player in international oil markets and competing hotly for market share, meaning that oil prices are set to stay hemmed in by the push and pull between US shale and Opec, with the exception of geopolitical flare-ups.', 'The supply-side risk to Middle East oil continues to be a significant factor for investors ever since the flare-up of tensions between the US and Iran in early January.', 'Fears of a prolonged conflict appear to have calmed but the situation is volatile and uneasy, meaning that oil prices may spike or even slump unexpectedly depending on what happens next.', 'Looking ahead, a bright spot for prices may be waning recession fears as investors get ready for a more robust post-trade war reality. Global recession fears were behind much of oils price weakness last year and may have a long-tail effect in the first quarter before receding further on more positive news from trade talks.', 'The upside scenario for oil prices would be a definitive resolution to the US-China trade dispute and a reduction of geopolitical tensions. The downside would be a lag between the first and second phase agreement, adding to uncertainty, and an escalation of geopolitical tensions. Investors should expect either scenario to materialise and be prepared for oil prices to react accordingly.', 'nSource: The National']"

That compares with an advance of 18% for the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -1.57%. Exxon and Chevron are Dow components.', 'What else to expect: Chevron in December said it was taking a $10 billion to $11 billion charge in its fourth-quarter results, partly related to soured natural-gas bets in North America. The company said then it was evaluating strategic alternatives for some natural-gas assets, including a potential sale.', 'Expect investors to want more clarity about these alternatives. Bears are concerned weak U.S. gas and liquefied natural gas prices could weigh in the near term, analysts at Goldman Sachs said in a note this week.', 'In the previous quarterly update, Chevron focused on its Tengiz oil project in Kazakhstan, a project that has gone through price overruns.', 'We believe it is too early to provide an incremental update around Kazakhstan, but still expect this to be a factor that is heavily discussed on the call, the Goldman Sachs analysts said in the note. While we are constructive on the (free cash flow) power of (Chevron), investors are concerned around the inventory life of the business and whether the company is underinvesting, they said.', 'An update on Tengiz will be important as investors are looking for further assurances that last quarters ~25% budget raise was the final increase, the JPMorgan analysts said. The analysts also expect details around Chevrons Gulf of Mexico projects, and how the offshore area fits into (Chevrons) growth strategy beyond Tengiz, they said.', 'At Exxon, concerns have centered around margins for its gas, chemicals, and refined products. The Goldman analysts expect the call to focus on Exxons plan to improve its downstream earnings, and the status of its ongoing asset sale program.', 'The analysts at JPMorgan said they expect continued challenges for Exxons chemical business and hold a tempered view on upside potential for downstream this year.', 'An update about Guyana projects and an initial look at 2020 capital expenditure plan would also be important, even as Exxon is likely to save any key details on capex and production outlook for its March analyst day.', 'Finally, following (Chevrons) big asset write-down in December, we think that (Exxon) may have to follow suit, a negative for optics. Bottom line, we find little to be excited about near-term with the challenging macro backdrop across all of (Exxons) businesses, they said.', 'nSource: Market Watch']"

    "title": "Iraqs instability threatens oil market security, balance",
    "content": "['The ongoing insurgency in Iraq is at the moment the biggest challenge to the stability of the oil market, said Fatih Birol, executive director of the Paris-based International Energy Agency (IEA).', 'The recent developments in Iraq  the second-largest producer in Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)  is the single largest threat to the stable oil market in the short-term, Birol warned during an exclusive interview with Daily Sabah on the sidelines of the 50th World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meetings in Davos, Switzerland.', 'Iraq has been mired in violent clashes between police and anti-government demonstrators, who are pressing for an overhaul of the countrys political system. Some of the oilfields have been temporarily shut down as the widespread unrest has escalated. Located in Wasit province, the al-Ahdab oilfield, developed by Chinas CNPC with an output capacity at 70,000 barrels per day (bpd), had stopped production for a week and resumed Sunday. Badra, another oil field in the same province whose shareholders include Russias Gazprom Neft, also faces the risk of closure. The field has an output of about 50,000 bpd.', 'Exempt from the OPEC cut deal since 2016, the Iraqi crude production had delivered a steadily increasing performance. In 2017, the average production was calculated at 5.5 million bpd, the data by Norway-based energy intelligence firm Rystad Energy revealed. The country produced 5.6 million bpd and 5.8 million bpd in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Up until now in January, the output has fallen to 4.7 million bpd, the company said.', 'Both domestic developments in Iraq and the surrounding geopolitical tensions are feeding worries concerning the output in the country, the IEAs executive director said. This is the major potential problem in the short-term. If the output in Iraq is disrupted, it would create a huge impact on prices, he added.', 'Although we are facing serious problems, the oil markets hover around reasonable levels, Birol said, elaborating: Venezuela is a very significant producer and its production has almost dropped to zero because of the political turmoil in the country. As a result of sanctions, Irans crude exports have remarkably depreciated. The drone attacks on Saudi Arabias national oil company Aramco in September, the continuous unrest in Libya and the killing of the Iranian general (Qassem Soleimani) have not yielded major impact on the oil prices. Despite all these developments, oil prices have remained reasonable.', 'Despite the major developments that could have shocked the markets a decade ago, the oil prices stood around $60 per barrel over the last year. In January 2019, the OPEC basket price was $58.74 and in January 2020 so far the average price has stood at $66. Still, the oil prices spiked as much as 20%, tipping over $70 per barrel in the wake of the September attacks on Aramco facility, crippling half of the production capacity by nearly 50%, but the price quickly retreated to around $60. After Soleimanis killing on Jan. 3, the prices posted a quick reaction and hit $70 on Jan. 6, but the impact remained ephemeral as the markets saw no concern over supply.', 'Birol explained the reason behind the stabilized and serene markets as the continuous glut elsewhere in the world. There is an abundance of oil coming from the U.S., Brazil, Norway, Guyana and Canada. Thats why we are seeing a more comfortable market now. These incidents are somehow tolerated in the current oil market, he underscored.', 'Venezuelas production dipped to 0.6 million bpd this month on average from 2.3 million in 2017, 1.6 million in 2018 and 0.9 million in 2019, according to the data obtained from Rystad Energy.', 'Bogged down in political conflict since the overthrow of Moammar Gadhafi, Libyas oil production has been sporadically disrupted as the National Oil Company has been implementing force majeure and shutting down production operations in some field. Putschist Gen. Khalifa Haftar has also been disrupting the output in some of the fields located in the areas under his control.', 'While the country produced 1.4 million bpd in 2019, its January production has not benefited from the further rise and stands around 1.2 million, the Rystad data showed. However, due to the blockade by Haftar, the production has been staggering since Jan. 18. The National Oil Company of Libya announced on Sunday that the countrys crude oil production has decreased by 76.3%, reaching nearly 284,000 barrels per day, resulting in cumulative losses of nearly $318 million as a result of the blockade by Haftar militia.', 'Ahead of the Berlin conference on Jan. 19, Haftar and the Petroleum Facilities Guard of the central and eastern regions blockaded oil exports on Saturday from Brega, Ras Lanuf, Hariga, Zueitina and Sidra ports with instruction delivered to Sirte Oil Company, Harouge Oil Operations, Waha Oil Company, Zueitina Oil Company and Arab Gulf Oil Company (AGOCO), subsidiaries of the National Oil Corporation. The blockage was estimated to cost a loss of crude oil production of 800,000 barrels per day.', 'Previously the third-largest exporter and producer of OPEC, Irans operations have been outstandingly crippled by the U.S. sanctions that were reimposed following the countrys withdrawal from the nuclear deal in May 2018. The Persian Gulf nations production, according to the Rystad, was 5.3 million bpd in 2017  enjoying the benefits of the 2016 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) deal. In 2019, the Iranian crude output fell to 3.7 million and in January this year, it has averaged at 2.7 million bpd, Rystad said.', 'Demand security key word for producers', 'In an elaboration on the supply outlook of the oil and gas markets, Birol strongly emphasized that the world is embarking on a new period of abundance in energy supply.', 'In oil, natural gas and renewable energy, the projection is rising and will keep increasing to a great extent. At the same time, the soaring output is putting downward pressure on prices, Birol explained.', 'The IEA executive chairman drew attention to a significant changing dynamic of the energy markets, a dynamic shifting in favor of the big importers. Five or six years ago, Birol opined, major gas producers had the strongest leverage in negotiations with their clients. At the moment, given the copious amount of production, the buyers are very strong, he emphasized. Some of the producers will see a remarkable increase in gas output. For instance, the U.S., Australia, Russia and Qatar will see an outstanding surge in gas production, Birol explained.', 'Qatars state-owned energy giant Qatar Petroleum was previously reported to increase liquefied natural gas (LNG) production capacity to 126 million tons per annum (mtpa) by 2027, an increase of 64% from the current level of 77 mtpa. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) predicts dry natural gas production in the U.S. will rise by 2.9% in 2020.', 'The rise in gas output will increase propitious circumstances for countries like Turkey, he remarked, pointing out the fact that now the energy world is talking about demand security. Turkey should and will benefit from plummeting prices as a major gas importer. The current and prospective production conditions will enable Turkey to diversify its suppliers. It has remarkably empowered the infrastructure for LNG, he said. The current low price environment will hopefully enable Turkey to increase its negotiating power for the upcoming contracts, Birol added.', 'In the last decade, the European countries have already availed the resource abundance and saved billions of dollars in their negotiations for the pipeline gas contracts.', 'Some of Turkeys long-term gas contracts will expire in 2021, and the number of gas imports stipulated in those contracts total 16 billion cubic meters, corresponding to nearly 30% of the approximately 50 billion cubic meters (bcm) of domestic gas consumption per year, according to the Energy Market Regulatory Authority (EMRA).', 'Between January and October of last year, the amount of gas imports provided to Turkey through the pipelines hit roughly 35.5 bcm, according to initial calculations based on EMRA data. LNG imports, on the other hand, slightly exceeded 10 bcm, accounting for nearly 25% of the total gas imports in the said period.', 'Plummeting prices', 'In addition to the abundant supply, gas prices have been influenced by another striking reality: the mild winter temperatures. In contrast to previous years, countries around the world have experienced the effects of mild temperatures in the winters due to climate change. Even guests in Davos were welcomed by mild weather in the Swiss Alpine town  a fact German Chancellor Angela Merkel pointed out to raise alarms against climate change in her special address Thursday.', 'The lower winter temperatures have led to a further plunge in the prices since the gas demand has depreciated. On Jan. 21, U.S. natural gas futures fell below $2 per million British thermal units (mmBtu), down 5.4% to $1.8 mmBtu to their lowest level nearly since March 2016.', 'Asian spot prices for LNG plummeted to a multi-year low Monday, pressured by a lack of demand to consume abundant supplies. Coupled with milder-than-usual winter weather and curbed demand, some contracts fell below $4 per mmbtu in the Asian markets  the lowest in the last decade. The average LNG price for March delivery into northeast Asia was estimated to be around $4 per mmBtu, down $0.60 per mmBtu from the previous week.', 'The Oslo-based energy firm Rystad Energy said in its latest Global Service Report the market fundamentals will remain loose through 2021 before prices tighten significantly as LNG demand growth outpaces currently sanctioned liquefaction capacity.', 'Our long-term price for Europe and Asia remains unchanged. In a balanced market, prices will need to be sufficient to cover the supply costs of new LNG projects. Consequently, we forecast prices to be about $7.10 per mmBtu at TTF (on real prices) and $8.20 per mmBtu for Asia Spot LNG (on real prices) in 2030, the company explained. For Henry Hub in the U.S., the estimates for 2030 remain at $3.29 mmBtu, but the prices are expected to increase further in the post-2030 period.', 'Investment appetite for hydrocarbons', 'When asked about the investment trajectory in an environment of falling prices, Birol underscored that investment in fossil fuels will continue despite a waning appetite, yet strongly pointing out the rising trend in the renewables will also continue.', 'The increasingly emerging new technologies in wind power, electric vehicles and hydrogen have nurtured the investment appetite. But these technologies have not matured, he said, drawing a comparison with the hydrocarbon investments. Moreover, Birol also stressed that renewable investments will account for 75% of electric investments in the next five years.', 'According to the IEAs Renewables 2019, global renewable-based energy capacity is set to rise by 50% between 2019 and 2024, driven by solar photovoltaic installations in homes, buildings and across the industry, report said.', 'With regard to the energy investment outlook, the IEA said in its latest report titled World Energy Investment released in May 2019, for fossil fuel supply, the lower levels of oil spending seen since 2014 would need to taper further to ensure consistency with the Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS). However, the agency added, investment levels fall well short of what would be needed in a world of continued strong oil demand  as in the New Policies Scenario (NPS). The IEA argued that the annual investment required for 2025-2030 scenarios ask for an accelerating momentum in the total energy supply investments despite changing costs.', 'Highlighting the growing attraction of offshore oil and gas projects, the IEA stressed that companies are moving ahead with highest-value projects, many of which are in the Gulf of Mexico, Guyana, the North Sea and Brazil in addition to large LNG projects and sanctioning of gas fields in Mozambique.', 'While 2019 marked the third consecutive year to see an increase in projects sanctioned, 2020 could see fewer project commitments but higher capex (capital expenditure) investments than 2019 levels, Rystad Energy said in its Global Service report. According to estimates by the company, 2020 will see investment projects worth $217 billion undergo the sanctioning process, including $115 billion in onshore projects and $102 billion in offshore projects. Up until now in 2020, energy investment projects worth $18 billion have received sanctioning.', 'nSource: Daily Sabah']"

As oil prices recovered somewhat after 2016, the number of filings declined to 24 in 2017 and 28 in 2018.', 'But the fourth quarter of 2018 saw a steep drop in oil prices, and that decline lingered into 2019. This resulted in a jump in the number of filings in 2019 back up to 42.', 'Of the 208 bankruptcy filings, Texas led the list with 94. Colorado and Louisiana were far behind Texas with 11 filings each, while New York was in fourth place with 10. Canada overall had 18 oil and gas producer bankruptcy filings.', 'Haynes and Boone also reported that the oilfield services sector was hit hard, with 196 bankruptcies over the five-year period.

But even if oil is at $60, $62 or $63 a barrel, it doesnt solve the problem for some E&P companies.', 'Exploration and production companies were at the epicenter of energy defaults that last peaked at 33% during the 2015-2016 commodity crisis for speculative-grade (junk-rated) U.S. oil-and-gas companies, according to a recent Moodys report.', 'While analysts at the credit rating agency dont think energy defaults are likely to return to that high-water mark, partly because billions worth of soured debt already has been swept away in bankruptcy courts, they do see the potential for more trouble.', 'The Moodys team attributed the recent spike in energy junk-bond defaults to 12% in October from a low of 5% in January 2019 to a stalled, not finished cycle of fallout from the commodity crisis, but where debt servicing problems have been moving down the chain, from E&P companies to oil-field services, support transportation and midstream pipeline companies.', 'Energy engineering and construction firm McDermott International Inc. MDR, -64.45% filed for bankruptcy protection in Houston on Tuesday, after struggling with ballooning debt. It plans to emerge from bankruptcy with new ownership in the coming months, while paying bondholders a minimal recovery, according to a Wall Street Journal report.', 'McDermott is one of eight energy companies that CreditSights flagged on Wednesday as having the potential to default in 2020.', 'CreditSights highlighted that nearly a quarter of the $170 billion of energy debt included in the closely following ICE B. of A. U.S. High-Yield Index was distressed at year-end, a category reserved for bonds that trade at a spread of more than 1,000 basis points above a risk-free benchmark.', 'It is also a category that CreditSights views as highly correlated with future default rates.', 'Meanwhile, Moodys thinks the recent multiyear dip in junk-rated energy company defaults was due to investor-supplied liquidity, as opposed to a significant improvement in industry fundamentals. In other words, a decade of ultralow global rates has kept investors snapping up the debt of weaker energy U.S. companies, even as returns have dwindled.', 'As of last Thursday, yields on the BB-rated portion of the U.S. high-yield bond market, which is considered a less risky bracket since it is nearest to investment-grade, fell to a record low of 3.89%, up from 6.30% in January 2019, according to a JPMorgan note to clients on Wednesday.', 'According to their chart, only a sliver of the sectors bond currently trade at yields of 10% and higher, even though the 30-year U.S. high-yield bond average is 9.8%.', 'But the lure of todays low rates clearly has companies scrambling to borrow, with some $21.9 billion of new high-yield bonds already issued in January, of which all but $4.6 billion refinanced existing debt, according to JPMorgan data.', 'The starting point was an increase in November in appetite for higher yield, Brian Robertson, managing director at Pacific Asset Management, told MarketWatch. Then, there was a window of increased oil prices amid the Middle East turmoil, which created opportunities for energy issuers to come to the new issue market.', 'To be sure, refinancing old debt by selling new bonds can be a key for companies trying to avoid default, since it pushes the repayment date on maturing debt down the road and ideally also lowers their overall borrowing costs.', 'Yet, the robust refinancing activity seen to start 2020 accounts only takes care of a fraction of the debt coming due in the energy-heavy U.S. high-yield bond and loan sectors, where JPMorgan analysts tracked a whopping $1.1 trillion of debt maturing between 2022 and the end of 2024.', 'Thus with yields down 200bps year-over-year, issuers should continue to chop wood in capital markets over the next few years as opportunities arise, they wrote.', 'The more favorable backdrop has enticed some investors to buy energy company debt in the lower CCC-ratings bracket, a category that borders default, but can also offer yields in the 10% and higher range.', 'But a team of Goldman Sachs high-yield analysts want bond investors to tread carefully.', 'Do not count on higher oil prices, Goldman analysts led by Lotfi Karoui wrote, in a recent weekly client note, adding that the banks commodity strategists are forecasting oil prices to stay in a range of around $60 a barrel for Brent Crude this year.', 'Issuance helps buy time, but our experience is that we still will see defaults in energy space in high yield, Robertson said, while underscoring that some companies are quite challenged even at oil prices of $60 a barrel.', 'Without higher oil prices, we still expect those to potentially head down a bankruptcy path, he said.', 'nSource: Market Watch']"

The International Monetary Fund forecasts 85.6 percent GDP growth in the small nation in the small country of 785,000 people this year.', 'That influx of wealth is sure to bring upheaval in Guyanese society. The oil contracts have already become a central issue ahead of presidential elections in March, with one popular candidate denouncing the oil contracts as unfair to the country and calling for renegotiation of terms with ExxonMobile.', 'Alhajji said, The history of poor developing countries that get suddenly rich from exploitation of natural resources tell us about only two bad scenarios: political instability or dictatorship.', 'Youkee, however, said there may be cause for optimism.', 'For one, all Guyanese production will, for now, take place offshore, with floating vessels loading crude straight from the wells and carrying it to refineries in the US. That will waive the need for more intrusive presence and facilities on the Guyanese shore, though it remains unclear what impact that will have on the industry dynamic.', 'Moreover, the Guyanese government has taken the opportunity to establish a sovereign wealth fund and a green development plan to make public use of incoming oil funds.', 'Youkee said, The current government has taken good measures in that respect which other countries havent done in the past.', 'nSource: Forbes']"

The health scare, which has killed 26 people so far, was enough to offset the impact of U.S. Energy Departments latest inventory release. The report showed that crude and distillate stockpiles recorded unexpected weekly declines.', 'Overall, the latest round of energy market selling comes amid heightened worries of the mysterious illness playing out like the 2003 SARS epidemic. Although it is quite difficult at this stage to assess the possible implications, according to Goldman Sachs, the deadly virus could lower oil demand by up to 260,000 barrels per day if it impacts passenger traffic due to travel restrictions.', 'Meanwhile, lets also review the EIAs Weekly Petroleum Status Report for the week ending Jan 17.', 'Crude Oil: The federal governments EIA report revealed that crude inventories fell by 405,000 barrels, compared to the 500,000 barrels increase that energy analysts had expected. A marginal decline in imports was behind the surprise stockpile draw with the worlds biggest oil consumer even as U.S. production remained at record levels. This puts the total domestic stocks at 428.1 million barrels  3.8% below the year-ago figure and 2% lower than the five-year average.', 'The latest report also showed that supplies at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma (the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange) were down 961,000 barrels to 34.9 million barrels.', 'The crude supply cover  at 25.2 days  was unchanged from the previous week. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 25.6 days.', 'Turning to products, and it is a fairly mixed story.', 'Gasoline: Gasoline supplies increased for the eleventh straight week. The fuels 1.7 million barrels build is attributable to higher imports and production. Analysts had forecast 3.3 million barrels climb. At 260 million barrels, the current stock of the most widely used petroleum product essentially remained where they were a year ago but exceeds the five-year average range by 4%.', 'Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) were down for just the second time in nine weeks. The 1.2 million barrels decrease could be attributed to strengthening demand and lower production. Meanwhile, the market had been looking for a supply climb of 1.6 million barrels. Current supplies  at 146 million barrels  are 2.5% higher than the year-ago level but remain 2% below the five-year average.', 'Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization was down 1.7% from the prior week to 90.5%.', 'The Energy Information Administration (EIA) Petroleum Status Report, containing data of the previous week ending Friday, outlines information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.', 'The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their movements, thereby helping investors understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that affect the businesses of the companies engaged in the oil and refining industry.', 'The data from EIA generally acts as a catalyst for crude prices and affect producers, such as ExxonMobil XOM, Chevron CVX and ConocoPhillips COP and refiners such as Valero Energy VLO and Marathon Petroleum MPC.', 'nSource: Zacks']"

Under these regulations, RFO containing more than 0.5 per cent of sulphur content is disallowed for use in ships and its violation carries heavy fines.', 'Most of the countrys refineries hardly produce furnace oil of less than 3.5pc sulphur content. As a result, furnace oil prices have plummeted by almost three times. The local refineries on an average produce almost 25pc furnace oil from their total crude processing.', 'As of crude oil import, the operation of the refineries has indeed slowed down because of the high production of RFO which cannot be used in bunkering after Dec 31, 2019 due to IMO 2020 regulation, the petroleum division said.', 'Interestingly, the crude oil import plunged by 27pc in dollar terms and about 15pc in terms of quantity during the first six months of the fiscal year before the IMO regulation came into force on Jan 1, 2020.', 'The petroleum division said it was engaged in development of a plan to upgrade oil refineries. Also, it said, the reduction in oil import bill was caused by increased share of power generation on coal in the energy mix, instead of furnace oil and LNG. Another factor in reduced import bill, it added, was the increased movement of high speed diesel through rail as compared to the past, while use of motor gasoline had reduced due to a decline in sale of vehicles and better availability of CNG in the last 12 months.', 'The petroleum division also confirmed that the growth rate of economy has indeed slowed due to fiscal stabilisation programme, but said the size of industry or transport had not reduced drastically. When asked to support these claims with production and consumption data, the petroleum divisions spokesperson said the data could not be made public without audit.', 'Another official said there was no requirement of audit for oil production, consumption or imports. In fact, he added, the Auditor General of Pakistan or even internal auditors never audited oil production numbers.', 'In contrast to the petroleum divisions claims, the data released by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics showed 12.2pc decline in production of petroleum products by the local refineries during the first five months of the current fiscal year. The PBS data showed that output of 10 out of the 11 petroleum products was lower than last year.', 'Production of two major oil products  petrol and high speed diesel, mostly used in the transport and agricultural sectors  was down by more than 13pc each during the first five months of the current fiscal year. Production of furnace oil was down by almost 16pc, but this could be attributed to the declining share of furnace oil in power generation. Jet (airline) fuel output was down by 4.27pc and that of kerosene by 5.85pc.', 'Production of lubricating oil and jute batching oil was down by 18.26pc each during the first five months of the current fiscal year. Similarly, production of LPG and other petroleum products was down by 11.4pc and 27.3pc, respectively.', 'The only product that saw an increase in its production was solvent naphtha as it was up by 12.65pc.

    "content": "['U.S. oil production from tight formations increased in 2019, accounting for 64% of total U.S. crude oil production. This share grew because of the increasing productivity of new wells that were brought online during 2019. Since 2007, the average first full month of oil production from new wells in regions tracked by the U.S. Energy Information Administrations (EIA) Drilling Productivity Report (DPR) has increased. The growing initial production rates have helped oil production from tight formations to increase despite the slowdowns in drilling activity when oil prices fell between 2015 and 2016. Since 2017, recovering oil prices and more efficient production from new wells have helped producers cover costs of drilling, production, and the development of new technologies.', 'The average new well in each DPR region produced more oil in 2019 than wells drilled in previous years in those same regions. This trend has persisted for more than 10 consecutive years. More effective drilling techniques, including the increasing prevalence of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling, have helped to increase these initial production rates. In particular, well productivity was improved because of the injection of more proppant during the hydraulic fracturing process and the ability to drill longer horizontal components (also known as laterals) and perforate more stages.', 'Increasing well productivity has supported crude oil production even in years such as 2015, when oil prices fell and rig counts dropped. In 2016, rig counts continued to decline sharply, and total U.S. crude oil production decreased for the first time in 10 years. Fewer wells were drilled; however, those that were drilled were drilled more quickly and located in more productive areas, which led to increasing per-well production.', 'Rig counts have fluctuated throughout 2019 in all DPR regions. The aggregate rig counts declined 16% in the first 11 months of 2019. Despite the decrease in rig count, producers are capable of drilling more efficient wells faster to keep U.S. crude oil production growing.', 'Oil producers have increasingly targeted the Permian region, which spans parts of western Texas and eastern New Mexico. The geological structure in the Permian region is more complicated than in other regions, and it took producers more time to advance the drilling and completion technology in the region. However, the Permian region is larger and has more potential for oil production than other regions. Total production and production per new well have increased in the Permian region for 13 consecutive years. In the other four DPR oil regions, oil production fell from 2016 to 2017 because of low oil prices. In Eagle Ford, oil production in 2019 is still lower than its peak in 2015.', 'Source: EIA']"

Oil prices spiked on the days when there were acts of aggression, but quickly retraced as the other side contained its response. Was this moderation in oil volatility the result of adept diplomacy, or is it a more structural reduction in geopolitical risk?', 'Oil dynamics are quickly evolving. The U.S. consumes less oil from the Persian Gulf, while countries like China are becoming an increasingly important buyer to the region. Shipping lanes have now been secured by an expanding international coalition so that the U.S. isnt the lone enforcer. Saudi Arabia infrastructure is less vulnerable to attack as it engages U.S. military and aerial protection to intercept any missiles.', 'Interference in Middle East oil is now less effective in trying to derail U.S. growth, rather, it would have more of an impact on the countries with which Iran is trying to ally.', 'U.S. Less Reliant On Oil Imports', 'The U.S. is less vulnerable to Persian Gulf oil disruption than in any time in recent history, with only 12% of its crude oil supply coming from the region. The emergence of shale production over the past decade quickly transformed the U.S. to near energy independence. This radical transition is allowing the U.S. to become a net exporter of oil.', 'Meanwhile, China is heavily reliant on Gulf oil production with over 40% of its oil imports coming from the region. The other large Asian economies such as Japan, South Korea and India are also large off-takers of the regions oil output. This is a critical dynamic as Iran looks to court a stronger relationship with countries like China.', 'The strengthening of this alliance between China and Iran was telegraphed through recent naval exercises. At the end of December, Irans navy took part in its first joint naval drills with China and Russia. All three benefited: Iran shows it is a credible regional power, Russia helps fortify its claim to be a power broker in the region, while China showcased its global naval reach.', 'The naval exercises were conducted close to the Strait of Hormuz. The location is significant: over 20% of the worlds oil is shipped through this narrow strait, making it the one of the most vulnerable choke points in the global oil supply chain.', 'Gulf Security Is A Global Concern', 'Any material interruption or blockade of the Strait of Hormuz could disrupt global growth. The U.S. naval presence in the region is there mainly to assure freedom of navigation and deter any interruptions. Over the summer, the U.S. accused Iran of attacking at least six oil vessels and, more provocatively, seizing a British-flagged oil tanker which it delayed for two months. Drone attacks on Saudi Arabian infrastructure in September were also attributed to Iran.', 'While the U.S. has been the key naval security cop in the region, the heightened aggression led them to expand the responsibility to a broader network. The U.S., under the auspices of the International Maritime Security Council (IMSC), recruited the U.K., Australia, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain and Albania to help patrol the region.', 'Japan and South Korea are also stepping up. While the two countries will cooperate with the IMSC, they will operate more independently to keep their efforts targeted. Their sensitivity is the result of the U.S. withdrawal from the U.S.-Iran nuclear deal, which many allies see as a mistake and the catalyst for the current unrest. At this point, they do not want to appear to be picking sides.', 'U.S. Protects Saudis Assets', 'After last Septembers drone strike on its infrastructure, Saudi Arabia recruited the U.S. to provide protection. The U.S. bolstered security with fighter squadrons, Patriot anti-missile systems and High Altitude Area Defense. This firepower is a major deterrent to potential attacks as it not only has a high probability of neutralizing any damage but is more likely to be able to identify and hold the culprits accountable.', 'Having this in place also helped Saudi Arabia to assure investors that its oil reserves were well protected. This was essential to its Aramco IPO launch; the governments critical equity raise.', 'Where Does That Leave Iran', 'In the past, Iranian threats to choke off the Strait of Hormuz were seen as an immediate risk to U.S. economic growth. However, thats no longer the case. As the U.S. evolves to energy independence, the countries that are most reliant on Gulf oil are some of the ones with which Iran would like to align.', 'China, as already noted, is a critical oil importer and its recent inaugural display of naval cooperation with Iran and Russia is helping anoint Iran as a credible partner. Oil interruption would undermine that relationship.

We expect any orders of newbuilds will require a renewable element, like Awilcos two green newbuilds currently on order.', 'Brands are getting greener', 'nEnvironmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria are increasingly important, and, as a result, are shaping offshore supply chain brands. TechnipFMCs SpinCo announced it will now be known as Technip Energies to highlight its ambition to be a global energy transition player. BHGE has become the Baker Hughes Company in a similar pivot towards energy-focused technology. Look out for much more of this rebranding in the near future.', 'Survive or thrive?', 'nA lower margin supply chain is a reality for the near term. Contractors will likely seek ways to broaden their scope of services to balance portfolios with the growth of renewables. Offshore wind projects are increasing in complexity, with larger developments being installed ever further offshore. This presents new opportunities for the supply chain. The next phase of offshore will ultimately be highly competitive; adapting early is vital.', 'nSource: Wood Mackenzie']"

Almost 80% of this growth is expected to come from diesel, gasoline and LPG.', 'Stabilising economic growth, the impact of the governments recent stimulus package and assuming a normal monsoon season, we expect a turnaround in diesel demand growth by about 4% to 1,830 kb/d this year.', 'Gasoline will maintain its positive growth, up 8% to 806 kb/d in 2020 as consumers continue to shift away from diesel passenger vehicles. However, a higher oil price and uncertainty in global economic growth remain key downside risks.', 'IMO regulations to prove beneficial', 'nGupta added: The IMO 2020 regulation will generally be beneficial for Indian refining margins. We expect middle-distillate cracks (price versus crude) to increase, benefiting Indian refiners because of the high yields of middle-distillate production in their product slate. But refiners will have to face headwinds from weak high-sulphur fuel oil and gasoline cracks. Supported by growing domestic demand and relatively higher refining margins in 2020, we believe India will be able to maintain high utilisation rates averaging close to 103%.', 'Focus on renewables remains high in the power sector', 'nSolar analyst Rishab Shrestha said: India continues to invest in renewable sources of power with a focus on affordability, security and environment. Despite the must run status of renewable power, wind and solar projects still faced large-scale grid curtailment in 2019, owing to the ongoing financial distress of state distribution companies. This has affected the returns on renewable projects, especially in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, leading to credit downgrades.', 'Even against this backdrop, the competitive price of renewables (averaging less than US$42/MWh) has led to an addition of 11 GW of renewable capacity expected in 2019 with solar contributing approximately 9 GW.', 'We expect Indian power generation to grow by 5% on the back of improved economic growth in 2020. With several plants under construction, we expect installed capacity to increase by over 15 GW, mostly coming from new renewable installations. The economics of solar projects are expected to improve as safeguard duties on modules come to an end in July 2020.', 'Slowing economy provided relief to domestic coal production, keeping market in balance in 2019', 'nPrincipal analyst Pralabh Bhargava said: Higher rainfalls not only resulted in lower coal generation but also hindered domestic coal production. We expect domestic production to improve in 2020.', 'In addition to a decline in coal-based power generation in H2 2019, cement and steel production were also down 1.8% and 0.3%, respectively. This resulted in a decline in coal demand. We expect coal consumption to grow only 0.5% in 2019 as compared to 8.5% in 2018 but expect consumption to improve in 2020 with a growth rate of 4.4%.', 'With power generation and cement and steel production slowing, stocks of domestic coals have started to increase in India. If the economy doesnt pick up in early 2020, and power, cement and steel demand remain slow, we see a downside risk to our coal imports forecast. Currently, we are forecasting 181 Mt of thermal coal and 65 Mt of coking coal imports in 2020.', 'Gas output to grow in 2020 after upstream sector disappoints in 2019', 'nPrincipal analyst Alay Patel said: 2019 was a disappointing year as oil and gas production declined. Major reforms were introduced for licensing, but these failed to translate into successful bid rounds.', 'Gas production is set to rise by 9%, underpinned by deepwater projects operated by Reliance (KG-D6) and ONGC (KG-DW-98/2). Both projects are on track for a 2020 start-up  although we expect only one well to be onstream in ONGCs field.', 'LNG demand growth to depend on pace of city gas and regas infrastructure buildout', 'nAsia Pacific Head of Markets & Transitions, Prakash Sharma said: LNG demand grew 2% year-on-year through 2019 largely due to a slowdown in Q1 2019. Overall, RLNG usage was driven by the fertiliser (+9%) and city gas (+7%) sectors, which offset decreased consumption in the industrial sector (-8%). Total gas demand growth should rebound in 2020, supported by the fertiliser and city gas sectors.', 'In 2020, additional regas capacity is vital for India to fully benefit from the low spot LNG prices. The commissioning of two new terminals, Mundra and Jaigarh, slipped into 2020. The other main addition to capacity will be the expansion of Dahej by 2.5 mmtpa, which should be completed during 2020.', 'nSource: Wood Mackenzie']"

By using international oil contracts based on a different kind of oil, the structure of the hedge may not fully reflect Mexicos export mix dominated by Maya, which is typically cheaper than Brent.', 'SWEET OR SOUR', 'nI would expect a divergence of prices over the long term. This pressure on Maya could move prices down faster than its hedge. This would cause a loss on the physical sale of Maya and minimal-to-possibly no benefit of the hedge, said Ryan Dusek, director at consulting firm Opportune LLP opportune.com based in Houston, who added that the trade could end up being worthless.', 'The Mexican finance ministry declined to comment on the structure of the hedge.', 'The Wall Street source said the proportion of Maya crude hedged for 2020 was significantly lower than in previous years.', 'For the 2009 deal, for example, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley hedged 305 million barrels of crude using Maya and only 25 million with Brent, data obtained by Reuters through a freedom of information request showed.', 'The Wall Street source said for 2020, Mexico had bought put options on Brent on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) at $54-$56 a barrel and hedged Maya at $42.', 'Brent is trading at around $63 a barrel while Mayas official selling price for deliveries to the U.S. Gulf Coast is about $55, according to S&P Global Platts pricing data.', 'The options give Mexico the right to sell oil at the predetermined price, so if the actual market price is lower, the options pay out and make up the difference  acting effectively as an insurance policy.', 'But if the price of Maya, a heavy sour crude, falls faster than Brent, a light sweet crude  or Maya drops and Brent rises  Mexico could miss out on oil revenues without the hedge kicking in, analysts and market sources said.', 'Mexico has had to contend with the potential divergence in Maya and Brent crude prices before but the risk is now greater as demand for heavy crudes globally is expected to slump.', 'Reuters was unable to determine whether Mexico has taken additional steps to bridge any gaps between Maya and Brent.', 'HACIENDA HEDGE', 'nMere rumors of Mexicos Hacienda hedge, which gets its name from the countrys finance ministry, can shift prices ahead of its anticipated deals and the government fears participants push up premiums when they suspect Mexico is about to trade.', 'Banks have become much better at accumulating information about it, said Victor Gomez, a former Mexican finance ministry official involved in the hedge until 2018.', 'In part due to this, the hedges cost has increased 10-fold in peso terms since 2001, even though the number of barrels hedged has barely changed, the data obtained from the freedom of information request showed.', 'Mexico spent the equivalent of $212 million to hedge 200 million barrels in 2001 but in 2016, hedging 212 million barrels cost $956 million. In 2017, Mexico stopped disclosing the number of barrels it has hedged.', 'Now, for the first time in at least 19 years, finance ministry officials have declined to reveal how much theyre spending to protect 2020 revenue, saying the information would give speculators insight into their strategy and raise costs.', 'What we dont want is that they identify the moments that Mexico goes to the market, because that raises the costs of the premium, Gabriel Yorio, one of the main architects of the hedge under President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who took office a year ago, told reporters this month.', 'The cost of the hedge has also risen because the peso has declined versus the U.S. dollar and because options have become more expensive since many commodity-oriented funds, which were natural counterparties to the deal, have closed.', 'Officials have also declined to say how much of the 1.73 million barrels a day it produces theyre protecting, nor to what extent theyre using put options or a budget stabilization fund to guarantee government revenue.', 'All they have disclosed is that the 2020 hedge guarantees an average price for Maya of $49 a barrel.', 'Since 2001, Mexico has received three payouts up until the end of last year: in 2009, 2015 and 2016, the data showed.', 'Nevertheless, those three payments were so large the finance ministry could argue it was still ahead  at least before including the cost of the 2020 program.', 'Mexico has also taken other steps to cover its tracks. In response to further questions in Reuters records request, Mexicos transparency institute said additional information about the hedge had been sealed for five years.', 'It cited the finance ministry as saying revealing details could increase costs, affect Mexicos monetary policy and financial stability and create systemic financial risk.', 'This is part of Mexicos strategy to leave banks and oil majors in the dark about what they are buying and how much they are paying, said Gomez.', 'Asked about specifics at a news conference on Jan. 9, Mexican official Yorio highlighted the importance of the overhaul of the crude oil pricing formulas that underpin Mexicos oil exports.', 'Last year, Mexico changed the pricing formula for Maya sales to the U.S. Gulf Coast to be based 65% on U.S. West Texas Intermediate in Houston  a light sweet crude which is the most traded U.S. Gulf Coast grade  and 35% on Brent futures.', 'Before, it had been derived from West Texas Sour, Dated Brent and other grades that have become less traded markets. The formula also previously included fuel oil rich in sulphur, which has been hit by new rules requiring ships to use cleaner fuel.', 'FUND OR OPTIONS', 'nMexican officials involved in the hedge in the past said the government may be considering increasing its use of the stabilization fund to guarantee oil prices as a supplement to financial instruments.', 'From the mid-2010s, Mexico started to lock in part of its target oil price with the fund to contain the costs of the options it buys from banks and major oil companies.', 'For example, Mexico locked in a price of $79 for its 2015 hedge, with $76.40 guaranteed by options and the remaining $2.60 backed by the fund. In 2017, the last time the ministry released such information, $4 of its $42 hedge was covered by the fund.', 'Gomez and Julio Ruiz, another former official involved in the hedge until 2018, said Mexico was expected to expand this strategy in the coming years but cautioned it would struggle to keep enough money in the fund to hedge oil exports fully.', 'They would have to accumulate a larger amount of resources in this fund, Gomez said.', 'Nevertheless, those changes would do little to ease the concerns of some who believe Mexico spends too much on the hedge, said Ruiz, adding that guaranteeing oil revenue was still necessary given the pressures on Mexico and state-owned Pemex, the worlds most heavily indebted oil company.', 'In congress, many will say they dont agree with how this money is spent, and that it shouldnt be spent on the oil hedging program, Ruiz said.', 'But Mexicos finances would become a lot more volatile without it.', 'nSource: Reuters (Reporting by Stefanie Eschenbacher in Mexico City and Devika Krishna Kumar in New York; Additional reporting by Ana Isabel Martinez and David Alire Garcia; Editing by David Gaffen, Frank Jack Daniel and David Clarke)']"

Moreover, there is a paucity of data scientists with a working knowledge of the oil and gas industry.', 'Puranik continues: Big data in the oil and gas industry will experience incremental growth once it overcomes these barriers. The growth will be further accelerated by concerns such as falling profit and future uncertainty from renewables.', 'The oil and gas industry traditionally relied on paper-based data collection for maintaining records from daily operations. This approach has largely been digitalized now. Effective data management is essential for this approach to succeed so that companies can make better use of their data.', 'GlobalDatas thematic research identifies ADNOC, BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Equinor, ExxonMobil, Gazprom, Rosneft, Repsol, Royal Dutch Shell and Woodside as among the major oil and gas players present in the big data theme.', 'Oilfield service companies, such as Schlumberger and Baker Hughes, as well as tech giants such as Microsoft and Amazon, are developing industry-specific big data solutions to help companies such as BP, Chevron and ExxonMobil in data management tasks. These solutions can be customized for different operational processes and functions as per the requirements of the oil and gas companies.', 'Puranik concludes: The industry generates large volumes of data that require considerable time and substantial computing power to store and analyze. This can be done either by investing in data storage facilities of their own or shifting to cloud-based solutions. Companies are adopting a combination of both these approaches to manage their data requirements while also balancing the financial aspects.', 'nSource: Global Data']"

In general, there seems to be a desire to continue to support US companies that want to work in Venezuela. Theyre trying to protect these assets and hold the line.', 'Early Saturday, the US Treasury Department announced that it had extended for three months a sanctions waiver to Chevron and four US oil services companies allowing them to continue to work in Venezuela with state oil company PDVSA. It also extended a waiver preventing creditors of PDVSA from taking control of US refiner Citgo as a result of missed payments on its 2020 bonds. Both waivers were extended until April 22.', 'Before the waivers were announced, sources said that administration officials had considered allowing at least the Chevron waiver to expire, in order to increase pressure on the Maduro regime after roughly a year of oil sector sanctions had failed to push him from office.', 'Some analysts claimed that Venezuelas oil output, which averaged 720,000 b/d in December, according to the latest Platts OPEC survey, could plunge below 300,000 b/d if the waiver was allowed to expire.', 'But voices for preserving a functioning oil system in Venezuela and maintaining a revenue stream for a potential, post-Maduro government won out, said Frank Verrastro, a senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies energy and national security program.', 'I think the waiver extensions are directed at preserving options, Verrastro said. Forcing Chevron and service firms to leave, essentially cedes the space to Russia and to a lesser extent, China. It also doesnt preclude further sanctions, so the waiver extension was not a surprise.', 'The extensions allow the US to maintain a presence, at least through international oil companies, in Venezuela, and prevent assets from transferring to Russian and Chinese companies, said Paul Sheldon, S&P Global Platts Analytics chief geopolitical adviser. But with the 2020 election approaching, and no movement toward regime change, political pressure to ramp up sanctions will rise.', 'nROSNEFT SANCTIONS', 'The extensions, at least for the moment, seemed to dampen the prospects of additional sanctions, such as potential actions against Russian state oil company Rosneft, which continues to receive Venezuelan crude as debt repayment and then resells it to China and India buyers.', 'Asked about potential sanctions on Rosneft during a visit in Colombia Monday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declined to comment specifically, but indicated that further sanctions were coming.', 'We dont talk about particular sanctions, but everyone can fully expect that the United States is not done, he said.', 'A senior Trump administration official told Platts in August that the US was prepared to sanction Rosneft if it continued to trade crude oil and fuel with PDVSA, but analysts said those sanctions have yet to be imposed because of the expected impact they may have on the global oil market.', 'Its complicated to go after an economically significant target like Rosneft, said Kevin Book, managing director with ClearView Energy Partners.', 'Book said instead of broad sanctions, which could impact multinational banks and energy companies, the US may instead target a Rosneft subsidiary or affiliate.', 'Doing this in a way that could potentially stop Rosneft from moving cargoes out of Venezuela without inhibiting commercially important operations for IOCs would be very difficult, but not impossible, Book said.', 'nSource: ', 'nttttttttttntttttnttttttttt']"

However, this price premium will diminish in the first half of 2020, and market fundamentals will drive the crude oil price forecast in the second half of 2020 and in 2021.', 'Several geopolitical events have provided upward pressure on crude oil prices in recent months. These events include attacks on oil tankers transiting the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea, the September 2019 attack on Saudi Arabias energy infrastructure, and recent tensions between the United States and Iran. Monthly average Brent prices rose from $63/b in September to $67/b in December. Crude oil prices increased during this period despite global liquid fuels inventories growing by 130,000 barrels per day (b/d).', 'Further increasing the geopolitical risk premium on global oil prices, the U.S. military action in Iraq in January 2020 increased uncertainty about potential disruptions to oil production and shipping in the Middle East. Following these developments, the price of Brent crude oil reached $70/b, but prices have subsequently fallen.', 'As the risk premium decreases, EIA assumes that Brent prices will decline in early 2020 to an average of $62/b in May. EIA does not forecast supply disruptions, and any physical supply disruptions would put upward pressure on prices.', 'nSource: EIA']"

    "content": "['Oil prices are unlikely to sustain any significant gains this year despite escalating tensions in the Middle East, according to the chief of one of the worlds leading providers of information to the commodities and energy markets.', 'With the attack on Saudi Arabias Abqaiq oil facilities in September or the US drone strike that killed Irans top General Qassem Suleimani in Baghdad this month the markets did react but the reaction was short-lived because the realisation is fairly quick that there is supply which can come, said Martin Fraenkel, S&P Global Platts president.', 'I dont think markets are complacent. They are realistic about the nature of the disruption we have seen so far, he told The National in Davos, where he is attending the World Economic Forum annual meeting. The obvious key reason has been the massive growth in US production of crude and that continues to grow, albeit at a slower rate. If supply is disrupted for short periods of time like weve seen then there are either stocks or other supply available to meet it.', 'Producers both within and outside of Opec also have some spare capacity to meet any shortfall.', 'The vulnerability of oil markets to supply disruptions really depends significantly on what the overall supply and demand context is, Mr Fraenkel said. We see stocks of oil around the world as being reasonable and some of the key consuming countries like China have restocked over the last few years.', 'Markets are looking past supply-side risks. The clearest example of that is benchmark Brent crude increasing past $66 a barrel following the disruption in Libya which took more than a million barrels a day from the market temporarily, reducing the Opec producers output to its lowest since 2011. On Tuesday Brent fell to $64.84 a barrel as global supplies eased concerns and Europe said it is considering dispatching a military force to Libya.', 'In December, S&P Global Platts projected Brent to break above $65 a barrel between March and May before falling back to the low $60s a barrel by year-end. This is based on forecasts of global oil demand growth rising to 1.26 million barrels per day this year, up from 0.95m bpd last year.', 'We see supply of oil as being pretty reasonable relative to demand. We see 2020 as being a broadly balanced market, said Mr Fraenkel, who before joining S&P Global Platts had been with futures and options exchange owner CME Group.', 'Things could change, he said, if there was prolonged disruption, which fundamentally altered the supply balances in one of the bigger producers.', 'The September attack on Saudi Arabia was probably the most serious geopolitical incident we have seen, he said. In the past, that would have been massive for months and years but actually the Saudis were able to reinstate production pretty quickly. The market sentiment was that this is a one off rather than something long-term.', 'More broadly, compared to 20 years ago there is less dependency on Middle Eastern oil relative to the proportion of the overall oil supply and demand balance, Mr Fraenkel said.', 'This could mean that the kind of price shocks witnessed in the past may not be as much of a factor today. World Economic Forum research last week showed that the fear of an oil price shock and its impact on the global economy is not as pronounced among leading executives as it was several years ago.', 'Not always but generally, the shocks come from the Middle East. Its not just the Middle East but it was obviously the most geopolitically charged part of the global energy markets and was a very significant part of production, he said. Even a few years ago we had very tight supply and demand imbalance. At the moment thats not the case. Even if we were to have a sustained supply shock which took global crude prices high, for example, we are all pretty confident that in the US the ability to produce more shale oil at higher prices is there.', 'The US Energy Information Administration expects output to reach record levels this year and next. Rising production in the US could limit price increases, said Mr Fraenkel, who was also a senior commodities trader at several investment banks.', 'What happened when we had the disruption in Saudi  crude prices rallied towards $70 a barrel  all the producers in the Permian basin and around, theyre all hedging and selling forward there and capping the price rise  they can produce very economically for the next year to eighteen months based on those hedges. We see quite a lot of outstanding options which are struck at $70 a barrel and thats seems to us a natural resistance point.', 'On Monday, the International Monetary Fund said it forecasts oil prices at $58 a barrel but expects this figure to be higher in its October forecast later this year.', 'Clearly we have seen a rise in geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. We still have to see how far this goes. If you look at the response of markets and if you look at oil prices the reaction has been fairly muted at this point, Gita Gopinath, the IMFs chief economist said at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Weve seen some increase of about $3-$4 [a barrel] in the price of oil but nothing very large. Again its going to depend on what shape the geopolitical conflict takes.', 'nSource: The National']"

    "title": "Death Of Suleimani Threatens The Future Of Iraqs Oil Production Growth",
    "content": "['The death of Iranian commander Qasim Suleimani on January 3rd in an American drone strike has roiled Iran and Iraq. It has also jeopardized the future of Iraqs oil production growth. ', 'Heightened security risks in the wake of Suleimanis death could persuade the international oil companies active in Iraq  like Exxon Mobil or BP  that investing in infrastructure projects that are key to Iraqs oil production ambitions isnt worth it. Iraqs fiscal terms were already viewed as notoriously tough inside the oil industry, and routine maintenance at the countrys aging oil fields is only getting harder. Now, greater odds that Iran will lash out through its powerful militia proxies in Iraq to stoke unrest could be the last straw.', 'On top of that, the prospect of a withdrawal of US troops raises the stakes. Iraqs parliament voted shortly after the drone strike to expel US troops, calling the attack a violation of their sovereignty since it happened on Iraqi soil. A withdrawal remains highly questionable, since many Sunni and Kurdish members of parliament didnt participate in the vote and US president Donald Trump has threatened sanctions if Iraq follows through. Still, it means that Iranian counter-measures might enjoy greater impunity. It also increases the odds of a resurgence of Islamic State militants in areas where oil drilling or refining is done. ', 'None of this is to oil companies liking. As they survey an imperilled Iraq, they might step back from crucial investments in infrastructure like the Common Seawater Supply Project (CSSP), a multi-billion dollar scheme to extract more crude oil from aging fields by pumping seawater into them. Experts say the CSSP is vital to Iraqs plans to lift oil production above the current 4.5 million barrels per day. But now oil companies might be asking themselves: is it worth it? ', 'According to Paul Stevens at Chatham House, It is now very unlikely that the crucial common seawater supply project being run by Exxon  essential for expanding production capacity  will go ahead in the near future.', 'Looking to Iraq', 'In the wake of Suleimanis death, analysts raised and then quickly dismissed the possibility that Iran might close the Strait of Hormuz, a pivotal chokepoint for the passage of oil tankers, or perhaps intensify its proxy campaigns in Yemen or Lebanon. Those options risk inviting a military response from the US or allies like Saudi Arabia or Israel, although many believe Iran could still carry out attacks against individual oil products tankers in the Strait of Hormuz, echoing tactics that foreign intelligence say it undertook last year. ', 'Instead, all eyes have turned to Iraq. For Tehran, provocation in Iraq is the most feasible way to intensify a proxy campaign against the US. Irans foreign minister said it had concluded its retaliation against the US after firing missiles at a US airbase in Iraq, but experts are unconvinced, saying indirect counter-measures are likely. Iraq is the most cost-effective strategy to expand control and continue its shadow war with the US given its intelligence footprint and political assets, according to Ahmad Mehdi of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies (OIES) earlier this week. Tehran has every interest to whip up anti-US sentiment and further de-legitimise the protest movement in a bid to strengthen its hand. ', 'Iran doesnt have to take any additional actions to damage Iraqs future oil production. The mere prospect of them has already proved damaging, since it dampens investors enthusiasm. ', 'In the medium term, heightened security concerns might make it more difficult for Iraq to build production capacity, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said this week, becoming the most influential of several groups saying much the same. Rystad Energys Matthew Fitzsimmons noted that any spending plans in Iraq are likely to be under review given the current circumstances. And Paul Stevens, in a commentary for Chatham House, wrote that Iraqs future production has already been damaged as international oil companies are withdrawing staff for safety reasons  with worse to come. ', 'No country wants to hear that foreign investors are losing interest. Iraq may be especially displeased. Its oil production of around 4.5 million barrels a day will soon hit a ceiling of around 5 million barrels a day, with more growth achievable only by installing big-budget infrastructure projects that center on pipeline capacity and water injection into oil fields to boost reservoir pressure. ', 'There are some interim steps that Iraq could take, such as increasing the use of industrial water and water recycling, or expanding capacity at something called the Qarmat Ali Water Treatment facility, according to Ahmad Mehdi of OIES. But neither is a substitute for the big projects that Iraq really needs. ', 'Several months before the January 3rd drone strike, the International Energy Agency (IEA) had already revised down its forecast for future Iraqi oil production, from 7.5 down to 6 million barrels per day by 2030. The heightened security risks and Iraqs increased anti-American may well force the IEA to push that forecast down further. ', 'Iraqs long-term supply outlook may need to be revised, according to Mehdi. ', 'How a stalled megaproject illustrates Iraqs oil growth dilemma', 'How do you pipe millions of barrels of seawater a day across the arid plains of southern Iraq and down into massive underground oil reservoirs hundreds of miles away? It is a question for engineers that has fallen to bureaucrats and oil executives. ', 'In 2009 Iraq hatched plans to build what would become known as the Common Seawater Supply Project (CSSP), a megaproject that aims to inject seawater into the countrys oil fields in order to force out more crude oil. At the time, Iraq had high hopes for its oil sector, seeking to raise production to 12 million barrels per day by 2018. At that level of output, Iraq would have nearly overtaken the US and Saudi Arabias as the worlds largest oil producer. ', 'The delays began almost immediately. Awarded to Exxon Mobil in 2010, the following year Iraq suspended the project contract after Exxon signed an oil extraction deal with Iraqs Kurdish rivals to the north. The contract then went to Iraqs state-owned South Oil Company, which began studying where to lay pipelines and build water treatment facilities, but little has come of the plans. Exxon Mobil reportedly re-entered the project in 2015, but progress has remained scant. By late 2015, the time of a Wall Street Journal account of the CSSPs history to date, the scheme was seven years behind schedule and expected to be finished by 2020 at the earliest. By all accounts, it still has not limped out of the planning stage. ', 'Disputes over the commercial terms of the CSSP lie at the heart of it glacial progress. For international oil companies like Exxon Mobil or BP, which operates Iraqs largest field, Rumaila, Iraq has long been a notoriously low-reward investment environment. Companies flocked to Iraq in the 2000s, eager to grab a piece of Iraqs relatively untapped oil fields, and in exchange they accepted low per-barrel remuneration fees. But as the fields surrendered more of their crude, that thinking began to change, and oil companies have started pushing back. One company  Shell  already decamped in mid-2018, while others are reportedly jumpy. ', 'Concerns over corruption have become more central. In July, OilPrice.com published lengthy comments from a senior oil and gas industry source who suggested that Exxon was worried it would need to strain just to do things legally. A lot of what needs to happen in order to make this project [CSSP] progress properly will be in the hands of people who are less concerned about it working than about what they can personally pocket to allow it to occur, the source said. Transparency International ranks Iraq 169th out of 180 countries in its index of perceived corruption. ', 'Other reasons Iraq might struggle to hold onto its investors have little to do with Iraq itself. After the price crash of 2014, oil companies got lean. They brought costs down and honed their skills on the shale fields of the US. In doing so, they eroded Iraqs comparative advantage, which is the inexpensive nature of its low-lying crude reserves. All the while, new drilling opportunities were opening up elsewhere. An expanding frontier of shale oil drilling opportunities in the US beckons investors with short life-cycle projects, while massive new discoveries in places like Guyana have satiated much demand for new oil sources. Now, investors are returning to places like Angola as it and other producers bow to a new era of lower oil prices by relaxing their fiscal terms. ', 'As the worlds sixth largest crude oil producer by daily volume, Iraq retains great influence in the energy world. Increasingly, it may need to make do.', 'nSource: Forbes']"

(Granite) (TSX: GXO) for total equity and debt consideration of approximately USD 59 million (CAD 77.2 million) (the Acquisition). The Acquisition includes total proved plus probable (2P) reserves of 14.0 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMboe) and 6.2 MMboe of unrisked contingent resources (best estimate) as at December 31, 2019. The current production is approximately 1,500 barrels of oil per day (bopd) with further potential for light oil production and development upside, close to IPCs current area of operations in southern Alberta.', 'The Acquisition is comprised of high netback, light oil producing assets in the Milk River area of Alberta, located southwest of IPCs existing operations in the Suffield area, just north of the US border (the Assets). The Assets are currently producing approximately 1,500 bopd of 29 API oil, from an oil pool which extends over a 50 kilometre fairway. The Assets include existing infrastructure to enable the current gas injection enhanced oil recovery (EOR) scheme, with capacity to allow for potential further field development opportunities. The Assets also include associated oil and gas processing and injection facilities located in proximity to key sales points. Granite reported combined average wellhead prices of CAD 68.50 per boe and operating netbacks of CAD 34.73 per boe for the third quarter of 2019.', 'On completion of the Acquisition, almost all of the current production and infrastructure will be 100% owned and operated by IPC. The Acquisition will complement IPCs current southeast Alberta operations. The Assets will be managed by IPCs existing Canadian management team, with support from the operational teams currently working with the Assets.', 'Total 2P reserves attributed to the Assets as at December 31, 2019 are 14.0 MMboe, of which close to 100% are light oil. The Assets also include 6.2 MMboe of unrisked contingent resources (best estimate) as at December 31, 2019. IPC has identified a number of drill-ready opportunities that it believes could add further near-term production of high netback, light oil barrels.', 'The Acquisition aligns with IPCs strategy to target low risk production assets with further development potential. IPC expects to provide further information at its Capital Markets Day on February 11, 2020 regarding the Assets and IPCs plans to optimise production and pursue further development activities.', 'Mike Nicholson, CEO of IPC, comments: We are very excited to announce our third acquisition of high quality operated assets in less than three years since IPC was created. The acquisition of Granite provides access to a new resource play fairway that adds additional reserves, resources and production of long life, high margin light oil with significant growth potential. We believe that we can more than double current production levels within the next three years, more than fully funding this growth with the cash flows generated from these assets.', 'The Acquisition is structured as a plan of arrangement under Canadian law (the Arrangement). Under the terms of the Arrangement, IPC has agreed to acquire the issued and outstanding common shares in the capital of Granite (Granite Shares), including Granite Shares issuable under existing employee stock options, for aggregate cash consideration of approximately USD 29 million (CAD 37.4 million). The consideration for the Granite Shares will be funded from IPCs operating cash flows and existing credit facilities. Under the Arrangement, IPC will also assume approximately USD 30 million (CAD 39.8 million) in bank debt currently outstanding in relation to the Assets.', 'The Arrangement has been unanimously approved by the Board of Directors of IPC. The Board of Directors of Granite has also unanimously approved the Arrangement, and recommends that Granite shareholders vote in favour of the Arrangement at the meeting of Granite shareholders expected to be held in early March 2020. All of the directors and officers of Granite as well as entities related to GMT Capital Corp., Granites largest shareholder, together representing approximately 25% of the total Granite Shares, have entered into agreements with IPC pursuant to which they have agreed to vote their Granite Shares in favour of the Acquisition.', 'The Arrangement remains subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of approvals from the Granite shareholders, the Court of Queens Bench of Alberta and applicable stock exchange and regulatory authorities. The Acquisition is expected to close in early March 2020.', 'International Petroleum Corp. (IPC) is an international oil and gas exploration and production company with a high quality portfolio of assets located in Canada, Malaysia and France, providing a solid foundation for organic and inorganic growth.

    "content": "['In 2019, many central banks in both developed economies and emerging markets reversed the trends of their monetary policies to be more accommodative. The market turmoil experienced at the end of 2018 and the uncertainties related to the trade dispute between China and the US resulted in some deceleration in economic activities and hence called for more supportive monetary policies. The US Federal Reserve cut its main policy rate by 0.75 percentage points (pp) in 2H19. This was in sharp contrast to Fed policymakers expectations of a 0.5 pp rise in 2019 at the end of 2018 (Graph 1). With the Feds employment and price objectives met, and considering the expectation of a trade agreement, Fed officials anticipate interest rates to remain steady in 2020.', 'Graph 1: Key policy rates in advanced economies', 'Similarly, other central banks of major developed economies also reversed course. The European Central Bank (ECB), which had stopped its quantitative easing programme at the end of 2018, restarted in November 2019 with 20 bn in monthly asset purchases  with no clear finish line  and cut its deposit rate by 10 basis points to -0.5%. This also ran in contrast to the expectation of a potential rate hike at the end of 2019. The sharp deceleration in the Euro-zone, including persistently below-target inflation readings, has resulted in expectations that interest rates will remain at current levels for the foreseeable future. In Japan, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) has maintained course, extending its asset purchase programme while keeping rates steady. In spite of the continued support by the BoJ inflation readings of close to zero have spurred discussion about the feasibility of reaching its 2% target in a sustainable way.', 'Graph 2: Key policy rates in BRIC countries', 'The Feds shift to a more accommodative stance gave room for many emerging market central banks to ease monetary policy. Some emerging markets that had experienced significant pressure on their currencies a year earlier reduced interest rates significantly (Graph 2). The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) cut its main policy rate five times  by 1.35 pp in total  amid a significant drop in core inflation readings and deceleration of economic growth. However, the transmission of those cuts to borrowers continues to be limited. In the case of China, the Peoples Bank of China (PBoC) reduced the ratio of required reserves (RRR) twice to spur lending, while in January 2020, it has added an additional RRR cut as pressure on the yuan dropped. In Brazil, the Central Bank cut interest rates by 2.0 pp, while Russia cut rates by 1.5 pp, supporting the recoveries in these two economies. The Feds monetary easing helped to weaken the dollar in 1H19, while EM currencies were particularly sensitive to trade-related developments  two forces that resulted in large swings in risk appetite.', 'The low interest rate environment is likely to support economic growth expected at 3.1% in 2020. Moreover, some additional support could possibly come from countries with ample fiscal space, taking the opportunity to borrow at very low rates  or sometimes negative rates  to finance infrastructure projects, which is expected to support the demand for oil. Similarly, the continued accommodative monetary policies, coupled with an improvement in financial markets, could provide further support to ongoing increases in non-OPEC supply. Therefore, the collaboration between OPEC and non-OPEC producing countries participating in the Declaration of Cooperation remains essential in maintaining stability in the oil market.', 'nSource: OPEC']"

These are quick field hookups to existing infrastructure and do not require massive and long lead-time construction.', 'Gulf crudes currently priced around $60/b leave a comfortable margin for operators that survived the downturn and are now beefing up their Gulf operations.', 'Talos Energy, for example, in December made what it called a transformative purchase of US Gulf prospects, finds and production from several small operators. Also in December, W&T Offshore, a US Gulf-focused producer, bought ConocoPhillips last operated producing asset in the region after the latter exited US Gulf exploration in 2015.', 'Hess recently drilled its first US Gulf exploratory well in years at Esox, unveiling a discovery in October. It will be online later in the first quarter of 2020. And Murphy Oil in April acquired more than two dozen blocks with production in the US Gulf from LLOG Exploration.', 'Murphy is also developing its Samurai and Khaleesi/Montmort fields, to be produced by the Kings Quay floating production system.', 'While Occidental Petroleum was not a Gulf of Mexico producer at the time of its $57 billion acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum last August, the purchase marked its return to the US Gulf after a dozen years absence.', 'The company plans to spend $100 million on near-field exploration in 2020 that includes tiebacks and development wells drilled from platforms, Ken Dillon, Oxy senior vice president, said during a November earnings call.', 'nGULF MAY BE COMPETITIVE WITH PERMIAN', 'During that call, Oxy CEO Vicki Hollub said she believed the US Gulf could compete for capital  [and] can beat the Permian Basin, which analysts say has a breakeven cost of around $40/b.', 'Chevrons Anchor field, sited about 140 miles off the coast of Louisiana in 5,183 feet of water, is the first ultra high-pressured 20,000 psi find to be sanctioned.', 'Currently, 15,000 psi wells are producing in very deep, remote US Gulf areas. But 20,000 psi development requires subsea equipment rated to withstand more punishing pressures. Until recently the technology was not available.', 'Once Anchor is online in 2024, it could spur not only further exploration of those extreme wells, but development of discoveries made years ago but kept on ice for lack of production technology. These include BPs Tiber and Kaskida discoveries, which were announced in 2009 and 2006, respectively.', 'LLOG recently ordered subsea trees for Shenandoah, also a 20,000 psi project 200 miles south of New Orleans, containing 100-400 million barrels of oil, while Total is in the early stages of advancing another 20,000 psi project, North Platte.', 'In addition, the cost of newbuild facilities has dropped drastically. Better supply chain logistics, re-using hub designs in lieu of designing uniquely for each field, and sizing hubs for nearer-term output rather than the long-term, are greatly slashing construction costs in an era of corporate austerity.', 'The payoff has been that in the last couple of years, new production facilities have been given the green light by Shell and BP in the form of Vito, which has a breakeven cost under $35/b, and Mad Dog Phase 2, respectively.', 'The industry will be watching the performance of the upcoming standalone projects and that could have an impact on how other projects tread forward, Yahya said.', 'nSource: ', 'nttttttttttntttttnttttttttt']"

    "title": "Is The Upstream Sector Spending Enough?",
    "content": "['Upstream spend on development and exploration is a barometer of the industrys mood. Heres the view of our upstream team, led by Fraser McKay, Head of Upstream Analysis, Dr Andrew Latham, Head of Exploration, and Rob Clarke, Director US L48. ', 'What do we think global spend will be in 2020? We expect development expenditure of around U.S.$450 billion this year. Thats about 8% above the 2016 low, but flat year-on-year and 40% below the peak of 2014.', 'Is the industry spending enough? Thats the big question on our minds. Companies are still extremely cautious, with capital discipline the order of the day. Budgets are tightly controlled, though service sector costs are still low so theres more bang for buck. Despite the fall in spend, supply of oil and gas has continued to surprise on the upside. Whether that holds true into the mid-2020s depends on whether Permian tight oil delivers the growth we expect.', 'Where are the opportunities? Development outside the U.S. Lower 48 is robust, up around 4% to U.S.$352 billion this year. We predict a healthy crop of conventional final investment decisions (FIDs) of around 40 projects; below the 2018 peak of 54, but up on last year and the second-highest since the downturn. These hold 34 billon barrels of oil equivalent (boe) of resource with total spend of U.S.$220 billion, in line with the 2018 high-water mark. The average project size at over 800 million boe is also a bit higher.', 'Which segments are growing? Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is seeing a major growth spurt. The market is heavily oversupplied at present, but the industry needs to develop new LNG supply to meet growing demand. Last year saw a record 71 million tonnes per annum of new capacity sanctioned, including Decembers go-ahead for Nigeria LNG Train 7. 2020 could match that number with big projects in Qatar, the US and Mozambique. Spend on upstream LNG projects in 2020 will be up 50% on 2019 to over U.S.$30 billion (excluding non-integrated plant spend). Theres a concern about cost pressures after the squeeze early last decade, when new build was concentrated on Australia. This time, theres a wider geographical spread and spare capacity in fabrication yards.', 'And going backwards? US unconventionals  spend will fall by more than 10% in 2020, with tight oil and shale gas both down. Theres still plenty of tight oil inventory with breakevens below US$50/bbl, mainly in the Permian. But investors have tired of years of negative cash flow and jam tomorrow. Many of the independents that dominate tight oil production are being forced to reduce spend and, instead of pursuing growth, deliver free cash flow and dividends. The Majors, led by ExxonMobil and Chevron, dont have the same constraints and will increase spend.', 'The net effect is lower spend and lower average rig count. This will lead to monthly year-on-year tight oil production growth falling to virtually zero by the end of this year, albeit temporarily. Its a far cry from the rampant growth of the last few years. With Henry Hub depressed, cash flow for unconventional gas players is also under pressure and spend will decline.', 'Is exploration spend increasing as returns improve? No, the opposite. We expect a drop of 15%, to around U.S.$30 billion, meaning spend in 2020 will be just one-third of the U.S.$93 billion 2014 peak. The continued drop in spend comes despite improved exploration economics  we expect full cycle returns of 12% to 15% in 2020, the fourth straight year of value creation.', 'Conventional exploration is inherently high risk and vulnerable when capital is constrained. Fewer companies are exploring, with smaller explorers struggling to raise risk capital. Another reason spend is declining in 2020 is that well commitments have fallen away. We arent yet seeing companies rein in exploration directly because of risks posed by the energy transition, though that will come. We reckon U.S.$25 billion to U.S.$30 billion may be the new normal for undisturbed global exploration spend for the next few years.', 'Will the current spike in oil price change anything? Unlikely. The geopolitical tensions behind the January jump in Brent increase uncertainty and, if anything, weaken the case for discretionary investment. The industry has a reputation for short-termism but, in 2020, will be at pains to convince investors it wont fall into the trap of loosening capital discipline. Any surplus cash flow generated by higher prices will most likely be returned to shareholders as buy-backs or used to pay down debt.', 'nSource: Wood Mackenzie']"

    "content": "['Oil and gas companies are facing a critical challenge as the world increasingly shifts towards clean energy transitions. Fossil fuels drive the companies near-term returns, but failure to address growing calls to reduce greenhouse gas emissions could threaten their long-term social acceptability and profitability.', 'The oil and gas industry now needs to make clear what clean energy transitions mean for it  and what it can do to accelerate clean energy transitions.', 'Whatever path the world follows in its efforts to limit the rise in global temperatures, intensifying climate impacts will increase the pressure on all industries to find solutions. While some oil and gas companies have taken steps to support efforts to combat climate change, the industry as a whole could play a much more significant role through its engineering capabilities, financial resources and project-management expertise, according to the IEAs Oil and Gas Industry in Energy Transitions report, which was released today.', 'No energy company will be unaffected by clean energy transitions, said Dr Fatih Birol. Every part of the industry needs to consider how to respond. Doing nothing is simply not an option.', 'The landscape of the oil and gas industry is diverse, meaning there is no single strategic response but a variety of approaches depending on each companys circumstances.', 'The first immediate task for all parts of the industry is reducing the environmental footprint of their own operations, Dr Birol said. As of today, around 15% of global energy-related greenhouse gas emissions come from the process of getting oil and gas out of the ground and to consumers. A large part of these emissions can be brought down relatively quickly and easily.', 'Reducing methane leaks to the atmosphere is the single most important and cost-effective way for the industry to bring down these emissions. But there are ample other opportunities to lower the emissions intensity of delivered oil and gas by eliminating routine flaring and integrating renewables and low-carbon electricity into new upstream and LNG developments.', 'Also, with their extensive know-how and deep pockets, oil and gas companies can play a crucial role in accelerating deployment of key renewable options such as offshore wind, while also enabling some key capital-intensive clean energy technologies  such as carbon capture, utilisation and storage and hydrogen  to reach maturity, Dr Birol added. Without the industrys input, these technologies may simply not achieve the scale needed for them to move the dial on emissions.', 'Some oil and gas companies are diversifying their energy operations to include renewables and other low-carbon technologies. However, average investment by oil and gas companies in non-core areas has so far been limited to around 1% of total capital spending, with the largest outlays going to solar PV and wind. Some oil and gas companies have also diversified by acquiring existing non-core businesses  for example in electricity distribution, electric-vehicle charging, and batteries  while stepping up research and development activity. But overall, there are few signs of the large-scale change in capital allocation needed to put the world on a more sustainable path.', 'An essential task is to step up investment in the fuels  such as hydrogen, biomethane and advanced biofuels  that can deliver the energy system benefits of oil and gas without net carbon emissions. Within 10 years, these low-carbon fuels would need to account for around 15% of overall investment in fuel supply if the world is to get on course to tackle climate change. In the absence of low-carbon fuels, transitions become much harder and more expensive.', 'The scale of the climate challenge requires a broad coalition encompassing governments, investors, companies and everyone else who is genuinely committed to reducing emissions, said Dr Birol. That effort requires the oil and gas industry to be firmly and fully on board.', 'Low-carbon electricity will undoubtedly move to centre stage in the future energy mix. But investment in oil and gas projects will still be needed, even in rapid clean energy transitions. If investment in existing oil and gas fields were to stop completely, the decline in output would be around 8% per year. This is larger than any plausible fall in global demand, so investment in existing fields and some new ones remains part of the picture.', 'In some cases, company owners may favour sticking with a specialisation in oil and gas  possibly shifting more towards natural gas over time  for as long as these fuels are in demand and investment returns are sufficient. But these companies will also need to think through their strategic response to new and pervasive challenges. The stakes are particularly high for national oil companies charged with the stewardship of countries hydrocarbon resources  and for their government owners and host societies that typically rely heavily on the associated oil income.', 'National oil companies account for well over half of global production and an even larger share of reserves. Some are high performing, but many are poorly positioned to adapt to changing global energy dynamics. Global energy trends have prompted a number of countries to renew their commitment to reform and to diversify their economies, and fundamental changes to development models in many major resource holders look unavoidable. National oil companies can provide important elements of stability for economies during this process, if they are operating effectively and alert to the risks and opportunities.', 'This report was produced in cooperation with the World Economic Forum (WEF). It will be presented to government and industry leaders during the WEFs Annual Meeting in Davos on January 21.', 'nSource: IEA  International Energy Agency']"

Since long before he was elected, President Trump consistently called for lower oil prices, and he has strived to maintain low oil prices with his Middle East policies. The third rail of energy policy for every elected official in Washington D.C. is that no one is re-elected if prices increase at the pump or the electricity meter. Not Republicans. Not Democrats. This is why there is no national carbon pricing mechanism and no leadership from Washington to address climate change, even though a majority of all voters favor biting the bullet and paying for action to reduce carbon emissions in the US.', 'With this landscape in place, the one positive federal action that would benefit industry, consumers and the environment would be the construction and completion of natural gas pipelines to New England. That could buy votes for both Republicans and Democrats this year.', 'Notwithstanding the political climate, last years forecast for 2019 in these pages played out as expected. OPEC+ Russia proved to be unreliable, (once again) reneging on their promise to maintain higher oil prices and instead kept prices low as President Trump demanded. Wall Street investors forced a number of mergers and reorganizations. The Wall Street Journal exposed the dirty secret of US shale operators: child wells in the shale plays do not perform as well as the initial or parent well. Further research confirmed the findings and, in fact, demonstrated that the child wells are 30% to 40% less productive than predicted by operators in 2018. The rig count is down. Some operators kindly postponed layoffs until after the holidays. But the inventory of Drilled Uncompleted wells, the DUCs, finally began to diminish as operators took massive write-downs on their sunk drilling costs. The last of the write-downs should be realized with the 2019 yearend reports.', 'The natural gas industry also suffered from low prices, as the associated production of gas in the Permian drew negative (!) prices, as low as -$8/mcf, or thousand cubic feet, as supply overwhelmed capacity to take the gas to market.', 'That the Permian Basin flares more gas than many states consume is a problem for industry, consumer and environment. Chesapeake issued a going concern warning. Chevron wrote down billions relating to its natural gas assetsnot because the production of the gas is noneconomic at current prices but that the horizon for bringing that gas to market is now indefinite. The pipeline projects planned in 2010 to take gas from West Virginia and Pennsylvania to New England are no closer to construction. As a consequence, the residents of Boston pay more than $8/mcf for natural gas delivered as LNG vs. customers just 400 miles away, who pay less than $3/mcf. That every oil-burning house in New England belches at least 30% more CO2 with $60 oil than it would with the $18 heating equivalent amount of natural gas is ludicrous by any measure.', 'The first week of 2020 began with a display of exactly how dependent the US oil markets are upon the Middle East. Even though President Trump declared that the US is energy independent, consumers who purchase fuel at the pump every day know better. US oil production is up to 12+ million barrels per day. Some will point out that production of NGLs, natural gas liquids, are up to 6 million barrels per day and call that petroleum production to match the approximately 18 million barrels per day of US oil consumption. But they dissemble by mixing apples and oranges. NGLs are not refined into transportation fuels in the US.', 'Of the US oil production of 12+ million barrels per day, fully 4 million barrels are exported because US refineries are not configured to process the lighter grade of crude produced here. The US still requires imported oil to fuel our transportation infrastructure. And of course, with the recent ability to export crude, US consumers could find themselves bidding for US-produced oil against China or Japan in the event of catastrophe in the Middle East.', 'The exposure to lower oil prices continues. US domestic production is just 12% of the daily world market of 100 million barrels per day. Only 4 million barrels per day of US production could compete on price with members of OPEC in another all-out predatory price war such as the one experienced in 2015 and 2016.', 'Eventually, the newly publicly-held Saudi Aramco will go for market share, so US shale plays must improve productivity and reduce costs. Some of these shale plays will likely go into a form of suspended animation, much the way the Barnett Shale has for gas. For years, the granddaddy of horizontal fracking natural gas plays has had practically zero new drilling, with only one active rig this past year. The Barnetts economics are beaten by more prolific basins.', 'The major oil companies, so called because they are vertically integrated from wellhead to end product, have done well. ExxonMobil began a massive expansion of their Baytown, Texas refinery complex, but only after acquiring a major position in the Permian. ExxonMobils huge oil find in Guyana proves again the value of scale. Total acquired Anadarkos Africa assets after Anadarkos stumbles in US shale plays led to its acquisition by Occidental Petroleum. Chevrons aforementioned write-down did not diminish cash flow or prospective rates of returnagain, if ever there was an argument for scale, a company that takes a write down of $11 billion and does not miss a beat is certainly one.', 'Oil and gas thrive in the rest of the world. Rates of return for drilling offshore Western Africa, Israel, Brazil and almost any other nation are greater than that for the US shale plays. Of course, that is where the capital is headed. But there is great difficulty in valuing the 80% of the world oil market that is controlled by the national oil companies and regimes that can change the rules when it suitsto wit, the past deals between US companies with Russia, or with Mexico, or with Israel. Investors in the publicly listed Chinese oil companies had a rude awakening when the government directed the companies to increase spending on more domestic exploration. Sovereign risk is real. The Saudi Aramco IPO was Exhibit A for 2019. Saudi Aramco is not equivalent to any US listed and operated company, and it cannot be similarly valued.', 'US independents and those backed by private equity firms that were funded prior to the price war of 2015-16 have lived through capital destruction of more than $250 billion. Among the worst performing asset classes of the S & P 500, these companies remain in a financial limbo with no clear exit. For these companies, Tobins q, the ratio of the market value to replacement value, is less than 1. As Anadarko exemplified, these companies are acquisition fodder. Strategic investment in prime candidates may be rewarded. Each investment bank has its Top 10 list that usually contains Apache Corporation, EOG Resources and Noble Energy.', 'A contrarian thesis would be to start now. Pick up the castoffs of the independents and private equity firms. Conventional oil and gas plays in the US offer attractive rates of return, hampered only by the herd mentality of professional investors.', 'Most of us are short oil. We do not have enough fuel in the tank to get us through the month, week or maybe even today. Our exposure to catastrophe in the oil supply markets is less than one in 10, but significantly more than being hit by lightning or other natural disasters for which we buy insurance.

    "content": "['Australia looks set to reap the benefits of the International Maritime Organizations global sulfur cap as the countrys heavy sweet crude oil is widely considered one of the best feedstocks for making IMO-compliant marine fuels  and many Asian refiners are willing to pay lofty spot premiums for it.', 'Multiple Australian heavy sweet crude grades have seen their spot price differentials spike to record highs in recent weeks, reflecting the boost in demand for low sulfur fuel oil after the IMOs sulfur cap on bunker fuels was imposed from January 1.', 'Australian oil and gas producer Santos recently sold a 550,000-barrel cargo of Pyrenees crude for loading over March 4-8 to a Japanese buyer at a premium of around $31/b to Platts Dated Brent crude assessments on an FOB basis, the highest premium on record for the heavy sweet Australian grade, S&P Global Platts reported last week.', 'Crude and bunker fuel traders, as well as multiple refinery officials in Asia, told Platts that the high premiums paid do not reflect the refining value of the crude, but rather its value for blending into the low sulfur fuel oil pool.', 'Australian heavy sweet crudes including Pyrenees and Van Gogh are widely seen as ideal for blending into low sulfur marine fuels due to the grades rich fuel oil yield, very low sulfur content and unique specifications such as low pour point and high flash point, industry and Asian refinery sources have told Platts.', 'Australia may not be on par with giant OPEC producers in terms of output and export volumes, but it stands among the top-tier producers in terms of quality of the crude and condensate produced, making it a niche market for Asian buyers to tap into.', 'Australian crudes, light or heavy, are the sweetest grades you could ever find. They typically have a sulfur content of less than 0.3%-0.4%, which means [some of the countrys] heavy grades could go straight into the low sulfur marine fuels blending pool, said a crude trading manager at Beijing-based Chinaoil, a trading arm of state-run PetroChina.', 'Pyrenees has a gravity of 19.3 API with 0.19% sulfur and Van Gogh has API gravity of around 17 and sulfur content of 0.33%, according to latest assays seen by Platts.', 'nWORLDS MOST EXPENSIVE CRUDE', 'Taking the latest spot premium of $31/b and the equivalent Platts Dated Brent whole month value for March of $63.83/b assessed at the Asia market close on Monday, this puts the indicative outright value of Pyrenees at around $94.83/b  essentially making the Australian oil one of the most expensive grades in the world, Platts data showed.', '[The price] is a bit crazy; it is probably the worlds most expensive crude, a Singapore-based crude trader said.', 'Santos had indicated a minimum bid of a $21.15/b premium to Dated Brent in its latest Pyrenees crude tender, reflective of recent stellar LSFO values in Asia, multiple trade sources with close knowledge of the tender outcome told Platts.', 'Platts assessed Marine Fuel 0.5% at $602.83/mt on an FOB Singapore basis Monday, equivalent to $94.93/b using a conversion of 6.35 barrels per metric tonne, making it comparable to Pyrenees value.', 'With demand for LSFO outpacing supply in Singapore, the worlds biggest bunkering hub, the price of Marine Fuel 0.5% has spiked by more than 185% month on month.', 'Singapore is expected to be short of low sulfur fuel oil with maximum 0.5% sulfur as supplies currently average around 2 million-2.5 million mt/month, short of the 4 million/month of demand for the fuel oil grade, Asian trade sources said.', 'That 2 million-2.5 million mt/month of supply includes about 200,000 mt/month of Australian heavy sweet crude oil, fuel oil traders in Singapore said.', 'Looking to take full advantage of stellar spot market premiums paid for heavy sweet crude oil since the second half of 2019, Australian suppliers have been stepping up efforts to increase their supply in the Asian market.', 'Woodside Energy, for one, started marketing heavy sweet crude cargoes from the Greater Enfield project in the fourth quarter of last year.', 'nSPOT PREMIUMS OFFSET WEAK OUTRIGHT PRICES', 'The high spot differentials paid for various Australian crude grades provide some relief to domestic producers after Canberra recently issued a downbeat assessment of its outright oil price outlook for the next couple of years.', 'Australias Department of Industry said in the December edition of its Resources and Energy Quarterly that it expects ICE Brent crude futures to average $62.40/b in 2020, lowering its earlier forecast by 7%.', 'Despite the drop in global supply amid OPEC production cuts, the US-China trade tensions have weighed on global economic growth and consequently oil demand from most OECD nations, the department said.', 'Spot premiums in double-digit figures would comfortably cover a modest year-on-year drop in outright prices  its a relief as far as export earnings are concerned, a BHP marketing source said.', 'nSource:xa0', 'nttttttttttntttttnttttttttt']"

We still expect production coming from, not just the United States, but also Norway, Canada, Guyana, among other countries, Birol emphasised. Therefore, I can tell you that the markets are, in my view, very well supplied with oil, and as a result of that, we see prices remain at $65 a barrel.', 'Considerable output growth is on the horizon. Norway is about to experience a sharp jump in its production. After a steady decline over several years, Norwegian output is set for a 43 per cent increase between 2019 and 2024, its Petroleum Directorate reported, reaching 2.02 million barrels per day in 2024.', 'The US crude oil production also rose to an estimated record-high of 13m bpd last week, the US Energy Information Agency reported. As per the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec), the US liquids output will reach 20.21m bpd in the fourth quarter of 2020  almost meeting the US demand of 21.34m bpd.', 'Oil production is also set to grow in energy-rich Canada. It is forecasted to grow at 4.2pc annually between 2020 and 2024.', 'New discoveries have also been made in Suriname. Consulting firm Wood Mackenzie estimates that the first discovery at Maka Central-1 contains 300m barrels of oil, 150m barrels of condensate and 1.4 trillion cubic feet of gas. The firm believes, there remains a potential for further finds in the same block.', 'A Rystad Energy report is underlining that the worlds oil and gas explorers are powering ahead, discovering 12.2bn barrels of oil equivalent (boe) in 2019  the highest since 2015. Last year 26 discoveries of more than 100m boe were recorded.', 'In Russia, Gazprom announced two discoveries in the Kara Sea, Dinkov in the Rusanovsky and Nyarmeyskoye in the Nyarmeysky block. Rystad Energy estimates Gazproms 2019 discoveries to hold combined recoverable resources of around 1.5bn boe.', 'And in the meantime, demand growth continues to be sluggish. We are expecting a demand growth of slightly higher than 1m barrels per day, Birol told Reuters.', 'Apparent demand for oil in China is set to increase by just 2.4pc in 2020, less than half the 5.2pc growth estimated for 2019, CNPCs research division said.', 'Chinese gas demand is also set to slow down to 8.6pc this year from an estimated 9.6pc last year.', 'In the backdrop, the Opec is not optimistic. It now expects lower demand for its crude in 2020, as rival producers grab market share and the United States looks set for another output record. Opec has now lowered 2020 demand forecast on its crude by 0.1m bpd to 29.5m. That would be around 1.2m bpd lower than the entire 2019.', 'All this means that except sudden spikes in prices due to geopolitical factors or possible production outages in a major producer, oil prices this year will remain largely range-bound.', 'nSource: Dawn']"

    "content": "['The phase 1 trade deal with China has been signed at the White House and includes the Chinese promise to strive to import $50 billion worth of oil and natural gas from the U.S. this year and next. Although that sounds wonderful, the truth, while positive, is somewhat less beneficial for the industry.', 'First, it must be acknowledged that U.S. oil and gas exports (the later liquified natural gas) have dropped sharply since the trade war began in 2018, as the figure below shows. Revenue had peaked out at something like $1.5 billion per month, or about $18 billion per year, close to what China is promising for this year, implying the target should be easy to reach. Next years target of $34 billion is much more ambitious, at least on paper. (See the second figure.)', 'First, it is worth noting that only a minor part of U.S. crude oil and petroleum product exports have gone to China, as the next figure shows. The loss of China as a market had little impact on the U.S. oil industry or the world price, although sophisticated econometric analysis or modeling might detect some losses on the margin. After all, any interference in the free market typically imposes costs on producers and/or consumers.', 'And, as American philosopher Dogbert noted years ago, oil is fungible: Chinese oil purchases were switched to other producers, U.S. oil sales went elsewhere, and the overall costs were relatively small. China could easily meet the 2021 target for energy purchases from the U.S. by buying one million barrels per day, which is about triple the earlier peak, but still only about 10% of their total oil imports. The oil China doesnt buy from other sellers would simply go elsewhere and the market impact would be minimal. (Maybe extra tanker usage.)', 'At first blush, the same story holds for U.S. LNG exports: China made up a small but growing market for U.S. exporters, and the loss of the market did not reduce overall export levels. At least in theory. The reality, however, is that U.S. LNG exporters are more interested in the potential sales which are enormous: China accounted for 50.5% of world coal consumption in 2018, an enormous source of greenhouse gas emissions, to say nothing of local and regional pollution. Increasing imports of LNG would have many benefits locally, nationally, and globally. The U.S. LNG export industry would be doing well by doing good.', 'But while the Chinese government is working to increase gas consumption and reduce coal usage, price matters. (Im considering having that tattooed on my forehead, but I cant decide the appropriate font.) And this is where the trade war comes in: the Chinese have put a 25% import tariff on U.S. LNG purchases, which makes it more difficult to compete with both other exporters and Chinese coal. Removing the tariffs would mean more displacement of coal consumption as well as higher sales for U.S. exporters. Unlike oil, LNG is not perfectly fungible because a lack of specialized unloading and regasification equipment restricts sellers ability to switch supplies between buyers.', 'Without a removal of the Chinese tariffs on LNG imports, the U.S. petroleum industry will not receive major new sales to that market, much of which could be incremental to global consumption, not displacing of other imports. This should provide a very clear target for U.S. negotiators, and hopefully the Chinese government will recognize the value to itself and its people of removing these tariffs.', 'nSource: Forbes']"

Sharply lower oil and gas prices have left shale firms no choice but to cut drilling to conserve scarce cash.', 'But the slowdown in drilling and output growth should eventually lead to tighter production-consumption balances in both oil and gas by the end of 2020 and in 2021, provided the global economy continues to expand.', 'nSource: Reuters (Editing by David Evans)']"

    "content": "['The most bountiful petroleum plays in the Middle East may no longer be storied gushers from the past but more technical offshore areas. The most recent hydrocarbon production boom is underway in the Middle East, and this time, the race is spilling into offshore waters. In this particular analysis, Rystad Energy takes a granular look at up and coming offshore exploration projects, most of which are outside Qatar and Iran, the regions major gas producers. Increased production of oil and gas will not only help the region meet domestic demand as well as notch up exports, it will entice sizeable capital into the region.', 'Figure 1 shows the dramatic increase Rystad Energy expects to see in Middle East offshore exploration spending, led first and foremost by the UAE, which will see upstream investments reach a ballpark figure of close to $1 billion by 2025. Our calculation is based on current commitments, upcoming license awards, and potentially viable future awards. The UAE is followed by Turkey, which could attract an estimated $350 million in spend. Saudi Arabia also could see a sizeable surge with investment reaching $300 million or more based on the results of the feasibility study from their Red Sea and other offshore areas. Bahrain could also potentially see a cosmic rise from just $10 million in 2020 to $230 million in 2025. Investment in Lebanon and Israel will come in waves with up and down years, but still see material gains in upstream spending.', 'The investment upsurge in the coming years will be driven by new drilling contracts, licensing awards and future bid rounds. In this article, we outline the main upcoming offshore activities in Kuwait and the UAE.', 'nIn July 2019, Kuwait signed a $600 million offshore exploration contract with Halliburton to drill 6 high-pressure high-temperature (HP/HT) exploration wells in the next two to three years, restarting the countrys offshore legacy after a more than 30 year hiatus. This new offshore exploration project with Halliburton could help to add around 100,000 barrels of oil per day in the future.', 'The Kuwait Oil Company (KOC) was able to fast track this contract with government support, most importantly with the introduction of a new tenders law. According to the law, foreign investors are now allowed to directly bid on projects directly without a Kuwaiti partner company. The new law is aimed to debottleneck the significant delays from the obstacles of appointing an agent and registering agencies that allowed foreign entities to participate in project tenders.', 'The offshore exploration work is expected to start in mid-2020 with the first rig expected to come by July 2020 and the second rig by January 2021. With this program, KOC hopes to complement ongoing onshore activity to support long-term domestic gas needs and oil exports. Kuwait has long been targeting to reach production of 4 million barrels per day (up from current production capacity of about 3.1 million bpd) but so far has fallen short in attaining this lofty goal, especially as production decline at the large maturing fields, notably Burgan.', 'Another setback is the loss of production from the Neutral Zone fields, which have been off production since mid-2015 due to political disagreement with Saudi Arabia. Rystad Energys current base case is that Neutral Zone production comes back online in early 2021, but expects the ramp-up to be gradual. These damaging setbacks have forced KOC to rethink its $500 billion investment strategy through 2040.', 'The 2040 strategy includes an oil production capacity of 4.75 million bpd and a refining capacity of 2 million bpd. The company is also keen on securing gas supplies plans to increase the countrys gas production capacity to between 3 to 4 billion cubic feet per day (Bcfd) to lessen the burden of importing LNG (which Kuwait has been doing since 2009) and burning oil in power generation.', 'nUAE has recently seen a series of successful licensing rounds with close to 31,000 square kilometers of acreage being awarded, both offshore and onshore, as shown in Figure 3. A large portion of offshore acreage awarded is located in the Abu Dhabi and Ras Al Khaima regions.', 'Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (Adnoc) launched its first-ever competitive bid round, awarding five blocks and securing more than $800 million in exploration spend. Out of the five blocks, the two offshore blocks have been awarded to a consortium of Eni and PTTEP and the three onshore blocks have been awarded to Occidental, Inpex and a consortium of Indian Oil and Bharat Petroleum.', 'Following the success of the first bidding round, Adnoc has launched a second competitive bidding phase which would offer unconventional blocks for the first time. The round would offer three offshore blocks and two onshore blocks and cover a total area of 32,000 square kilometers. The area contains existing discoveries and 290 targeted reservoirs from 92 prospects.', 'The licensing opportunities of onshore Block 2, onshore Block 5, offshore Block 4 and offshore Block 5 will be awarded in concessions to successful bidders, under terms that will be set out in the bid package. Offshore Block 3 which overlaps, in certain geographical areas, with existing concessions already granted to international oil companies, will be awarded to explore exclusively for potential gas in deep geological formations and potential oil in various formations outside the existing concession areas.', 'Elsewhere in Ras Al Khaima, the shallow offshore Block A was awarded to Eni and a partly onshore/offshore Block 5 to PGNiG. Exploration activity will be carried out in three 2-year phases.', 'The exploration block awards are expected to help the country achieve its 2030 strategy to ramp-up oil production capacity from 3.5 million bpd to 5 million bpd and to become a net exporter of gas. The UAE currently imports 2 Bcfd of natural gas from Qatar via the Dolphin pipeline, for which the contract ends in 2032.', 'nBahrains largest oil and gas discovery in the shallow waters of the Khalij Al-Bahrain Basin in 2018 has prompted the National Oil and Gas Authority (NOGA) perhaps consider US E&P companies with shale expertise to help explore and develop the huge prospective area. Reported discovered volumes are estimated at 80 billion barrels of tight oil and 10 to 20 trillion cubic feet of gas (Tcf), according to the energy ministry. Further appraisal drilling is planned to test the extent of commerciality. Only a fraction of the resources can likely be economically exploited, but given the magnitude, this may result in a significant production boost for Bahrain. Going forward, the next two years will be spent evaluating the commerciality of the discovered resources. One project already well underway kicked off in January 2019 when Eni signed an exploration memorandum of understanding with Bahrains energy ministry for an offshore conventional oil block, where drilling is expected to commence by the end of this year.', 'nIn Saudi Arabia, Saudi Aramco is conducting an investment feasibility study in the Red Sea after unearthing large quantities of gas. To the north in the Mediterranean, state-owned Turkish Petroleum has recently completed the Karpaz-1 wildcat well, which controversially lies in waters claimed by Cyprus.', 'The upcoming license rounds in Israel, Lebanon, the UAE, and Kuwait come at a time as the region is in the midst of ramping up local production to cover domestic energy. As onshore resources mature and become more numbered, offshore exploration is again in the focus. In some cases, we expect the quest to even shift from the mature onshore areas to offshore deep and frontier areas.', 'nSource: Rystad Energy']"

    "content": "['Oil companies are unlikely to report big positive surprises when they announce their December quarter (Q3) results. During the quarter, average crude oil prices fell year-on-year and remained flattish sequentially. Accordingly, investors can expect price realizations of state-run producers Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd and Oil India Ltd to reflect similar trends as seen in the oil prices.', 'Investors will watch production numbers closely when Q3 numbers are announced, especially for Oil India where production was hampered in December due to the protests over the Citizenship Amendment Act .', 'Meanwhile, the operating environment for refining companies in Q3 was gloomy, what with the benchmark Singapore gross refining margins (GRMs) declining sharply year-on-year (62% down) and sequentially (75% down).', 'The collapse in Singapore GRMs was primarily because of the miserable performance of fuel oil (FO) spreads. However, things may not turn out as bad for Indian oil refining firms as there are some comforting elements, which may indeed lead to a mixed set of numbers.', 'Margins for the oil marketing companies (OMCs) will hold up better due to their lower FO exposure and inventory gains too will help amid steady marketing margins, wrote analysts at Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd in a report on 10 January.', 'OMCs are Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd, Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd and Indian Oil Corp. Ltd. Some analysts expect Hindustan Petroleums refining margin performance to be a tad weaker than it peers, owing to the higher share of FO in its product slate.', 'Analysts expect Reliance Industries Ltds (RILs) Q3 GRM to be in the range of $9-10.5 a barrel. In the September quarter, its GRM stood at $9.4 a barrel.', 'According to Jefferies Indias analysts, RILs refining segment may improve, but not as much as the Street had expected due to the International Maritime Organizations new norms, while the petrochemical segment may post lower margins. Jefferies India has penciled in RILs GRM at $9.8 a barrel for Q3.', 'But for RIL, in keeping with the trend of last few quarters, its consumer businesses, telecom (Reliance Jio) and retail are expected to compensate for the muted performance of its energy business. Retail and Jio should continue to see quarter-on-quarter improvement, though the full impact of tariff hikes is likely to come through over 4QFY20-1QFY21, wrote JP Morgan India Pvt.

    "content": "['The IEA Oil Market Report (OMR) is one of the worlds most authoritative and timely sources of data, forecasts and analysis on the global oil market  including detailed statistics and commentary on oil supply, demand, inventories, prices and refining activity, as well as oil trade for IEA and selected non-IEA countries.', 'Highlights', 'nThe recent tension in the Middle East has once again added a layer of uncertainty to the oil market outlook. We cannot know how the geopolitical situation will play out over time, but for now the risk of a major threat to oil supplies appears to have receded. As was the case following the attacks on Saudi Arabia in September, once the initial fears of a sustained supply shock subsided, the Brent price rapidly gave up its $4/bbl spike and as we publish this Report it is just above $64/bbl, little changed from immediately after the OPEC+ agreement was signed in December. Todays market where non-OPEC production is rising strongly and OECD stocks are 9 mb above the five-year average, provides a solid base from which to react to any escalation in geopolitical tension. As a back-up resource, the value of strategic stocks has once again been confirmed.', 'Recent events have shown that Iraq is a potentially vulnerable supplier, just as its strategic importance has grown. In recent years production and export capacity have expanded fast: in 2010 Iraq exported 2 mb/d and now the figure is 4 mb/d. Iraqs rising capacity has been very welcome as sanctions have reduced Irans exports to only 0.3 mb/d and Venezuelas production has collapsed. Today, both China and India receive about 1 mb/d of oil from Iraq and another 1 mb/d moves to various European countries. In Indias case, around 20% of its crude imports come from Iraq. Amongst Iraqs other customers is the US. Data from the Energy Information Administration show that in January-October 2019 the US imported 337 kb/d from Iraq, and just below 1 mb/d from the Middle East Gulf as a whole. In the medium term heightened security concerns might make it more difficult for Iraq to build production capacity. In turn, this could make it more difficult to ensure there is sufficent spare production capacity to meet rising global demand in the second half of this decade.', 'In this Report, our main headline data for 2020 is largely unchanged from last month. Oil demand growth is forecast to accelerate to 1.2 mb/d, supported partly by prices remaining relatively subdued, higher global GDP growth than last year and by progress in settling trade disputes. The OPEC+ countries need to cut output by about 0.3 mb/d in January to comply with their new agreement. Meanwhile, non-OPEC production is forecast to grow by 2.1 mb/d in 2020 with stronger growth in the first half of the year.', 'The International Maritime Organisations new marine fuel regulations came into effect on 1 January. Although there are initial local difficulties as might be expected from such a complex global change, ship operators, products suppliers and ports have so far coped well (see page 13. of this Report).', 'At the start of 2020 the oil market has again faced a period of geopolitical turmoil at the same time as a significant sector is adjusting to a major change to its operating environment. That we have such a well-supplied and increasingly globalised market will help us to face these challenges.', 'nSource: IEA']"

Revenues from the oil and gas sector accounted for over 40% of Russias budget revenues in 2019. Furthermore, oil and gas exports are primarily paid for in foreign currency, helping the government to mitigate the impact of volatility in the ruble exchange rate.', 'Mishustin policies', 'nIt is as yet unclear what energy policy Mishustin himself favors, but he has a reputation for efficiency and innovation.', 'Mikhail Mishustin has an impressive track record as head of the Federal Tax Service, which significantly improved tax collections and embraced new technology during his term in office, analysts at ATON wrote in a note published Thursday.', 'Voloshin said that so far Mishustins only oil comments have been the suggestion that Russia may raise the cut-off point for oil export sales revenue above $40 plus indexation.', 'This is clearly geared towards freeing up more money for the funding of the costly initiatives that Putin outlined in his message yesterday and the new government will be tasked with implementing, Voloshin said.', 'Analysts see Putin as likely to continue to play a key role in Russian political life post 2024. The plans for constitutional reforms announced Wednesday would shift some powers away from the president to parliament and the prime minister. Putins presidential term of office expires in 2024 and, under the current constitution, he will have to step down when it expires.

This growth rate would be the slowest growth rate in natural gas generation since 2017. EIA forecasts that generation from nonhydropower renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, will grow by 15% in 2020the fastest rate in four years. Forecast generation from coal-fired power plants declines by 13% in 2020.', 'During the past decade, the electric power sector has been retiring coal-fired generation plants while adding more natural gas generating capacity. In 2019, EIA estimates that 12.7 gigawatts (GW) of coal-fired capacity in the United States was retired, equivalent to 5% of the total existing coal-fired capacity at the beginning of the year. An additional 5.8 GW of U.S. coal capacity is scheduled to retire in 2020, contributing to a forecast 13% decline in coal-fired generation this year. In contrast, EIA estimates that the electric power sector has added or plans to add 11.4 GW of capacity at natural gas combined-cycle power plants in 2019 and 2020.', 'Generating capacity fueled by renewable energy sources, especially solar and wind, has increased steadily in recent years. EIA expects the U.S. electric power sector will add 19.3 GW of new utility-scale solar capacity in 2019 and 2020, a 65% increase from 2018 capacity levels. EIA expects a 32% increase of new wind capacityor nearly 30 GWto be installed in 2019 and 2020. Much of this new renewables capacity comes online at the end of the year, which affects generation trends in the following year.', 'Forecast generation mix varies in each of the 11 STEO electricity supply regions. A large proportion of the retired coal-fired capacity is located in the mid-Atlantic area, where PJM manages the dispatch of electricity. EIA forecasts that coal generation in the mid-Atlantic will decline by 37 billion kilowatthours (kWh) in 2020. Some of this decline is offset by more generation from mid-Atlantic natural gas-fired power plants; EIA expects generation from these plants to grow by 23 billion kWh.', 'In the Midwest, where the Midcontinent ISO (MISO) manages electricity, EIA expects coal generation to fall in 2020 by 33 billion kWh. This decline is offset by an increase in natural gas electricity generation (12 billion kWh) and by nonhydropower renewable energy sources (13 billion kWh). The regional increase in renewables is primarily a result of new wind generating capacity.', 'The electric power sector in the area of Texas managed by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) is planning to see large increases in generating capacity from both wind and solar. EIA expects this new capacity will increase generation from nonhydropower renewable energy sources by 24 billion kWh this year. EIA expects the increased ERCOT renewable generation will lead to a regional decline of natural gas-fired generation and coal generation of 14 billion kWh for each fuel source in 2020.', 'EIA expects these trends to continue into 2021. EIA forecasts U.S. generation from nonhydropower renewable energy sources will grow by 17% next year as the electric power sector continues expanding solar and wind capacity. This increase in renewables, along with forecast increases in natural gas fuel costs, contributes to EIAs forecast of a 2.3% decline in natural gas-fired generation in 2021. U.S. coal generation in 2021 is forecast to fall by 3.2%.', 'nSource: EIA']"

Today, both China and India receive about 1 million b/d of oil from Iraq and another 1 million b/d moves to various European countries. In Indias case, around 20% of its crude imports come from Iraq.', 'Refiners in the US consumed about 300,000 of Iraqi oil in January-October, the IEA said.', 'With its exports doubling to 4 million b/d today since 2010, Iraqs importance has risen, particularly in light of sanctions on OPEC members Iran and Venezuela, the IEA said.', 'In the medium term, heightened security concerns might make it more difficult for Iraq to build production capacity, it said. In turn, this could make it more difficult to ensure there is sufficient spare production capacity to meet rising global demand in the second half of this decade.', 'Iraqs compliance', 'nSecurity concerns in Iraq have come to the fore following US killing of top Iranian commander in Baghdad earlier this month, prompting retaliatory attacks from Iran on US troops stationed in the country.', 'These attacks have stoked investor fears of disruption to oil supplies from the Middle East region and helped push oil prices this month to above $70/b for the first time since September. Brent has since retreated, hovering above $64/b.', 'Iraq pumped 4.59 million b/d in December, down from 4.65 million b/d in November, but still above its 4.51 million b/d quota under the previous OPEC + pact, IEA figures showed on Thursday.', 'Iraq flouted its OPEC oil cut commitments for most of last year, which was exacerbated by protests that targeted oil facilities in the fourth quarter of 2019. Under the new OPEC+ pact, Iraq will have to trim production by another 50,000 b/d.', 'Iraqs oil production is steady at 4.46 million b/d in line with its OPEC+ quota and exports are averaging 3.45 million b/d, an oil ministry spokesperson said last week.', 'Both exports and production have not been impacted by recent events in Iraq, he said.', 'Iraqi exports are either shipped through Turkeys Ceyhan port on the Mediterranean, where some 400,000 b/d are transported, with the rest going through the Persian Gulf, the IEA said.', 'This increases supply risks because importers, especially from Asia, get their crude though the Gulfs strategic Strait of Hormuz, where around 20% of global oil supply including crude and condensate is transported to the world.', 'Oil majors', 'nSecurity concerns have also prompted international oil companies such as ExxonMobil to withdraw American staff from the country after a US government advisory. Other oil majors may think twice about investing in Iraq, where nearly 63% of oil output was produced by IOCs in 2019, according to Rystad Energy.', 'BP, for example, was expected to ramp up production and boost its water injection program to become the third largest producer in Iraq, but the fate of this program is now uncertain, according to Rystad.', 'Continued tensions in the region could see BP slow their water injection program down, and limit the high-side of production for the company and for other international players in southern Iraq, Matthew Fitzsimmons, vice president of oil field research at Rystad, said in the report.

China wants U.S. oil and gas not only because of their record demand but also because of the price advantage U.S. producers hold over other producers of oil and natural gas. Better trade relations with China may also help with Iran said U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin during an interview on Foxs Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo as the U.S. is working closely to cut off Iranian oil exports.', 'Chinas demand for crude oil and natural gas continues to shatter records as the U.S. is now in a prime position to meet its ravenous needs. In data released this month by Chinas General Administration of Customs agency, the country imported a record 506 million tons of crude oil. That is equivalent to 10.12 million barrels per day. Chinese natural gas imports, including fuel supplied as liquefied natural gas (LNG) and via pipeline, were 9.45 million tons, the third-highest on record monthly. That made China the worlds largest natural gas importer.', 'China has been energy import crazy and that should have been a big win for U.S. energy.', 'Yet the trade war had China seek other places over the U.S. for its energy needs, including Iran. The trade war has hurt U.S. energy exporters as we start to become a world energy exporter. U.S. exports to China of crude oil and petroleum products hit a record high of 23,951,000 barrels in October of 2017 but have fallen to just 1,119,000 last October, the most recent reading from the Energy Information Administration (EIA). U.S. shale producers have been struggling because they have been producing more energy than we currently need and China would be the perfect customer.', 'The U.S. has just what China needs. Even with the trade war hanging over their heads, the U.S. exported nearly 4.5 million barrels of crude per day two weeks ago which was a new weekly record. The U.S. is producing more oil and natural gas than it needs and China should be a willing buyer. If they act now, the country could take advantage of locking in contracts at favorable prices.', 'But better trade relations may have even more benefits than just energy. In can help us out geopolitically as well. It appears that China will work with the U.S. to pressure Iran by cutting off its purchases of Iranian oil. Roughly 70 percent of the remaining Iranian oil exports are being sent to China, which remains Irans biggest crude buyer. Mnuchin said Chinese state-owned companies have ceased buying Iranian oil, suggesting that only independent refiners continue making such purchases. He also said the U.S. was, working closely with [China] to make sure that they cease all additional activities [with Iran].', 'So while the energy markets view the phase one trade with cautious optimism, the long-term benefits of a fair-trade deal with China will extend far beyond energy into a new and prosperous economic era.', 'An era powered by U.S. oil and gas.', 'nSource: Fox Business']"

But neither the 5% tariff on US crude oil nor the 25% tariff on US LNG is to be reduced or removed by China under the Phase One deal. For China to massively increase imports of oil and LNG from the US while tariffs remain in place, is going to be challenging.', 'Consider LNG. In 2017, China imports from US were approximately 1.5 Mt, worth around $0.6 billion. If China is to increase the value of US LNG imports considerably as a part of this agreement, lets say to around 10 Mt in 2021, then the 25% tariff would need to be either absorbed by the importing company, or passed through to the consumer. We expect that Chinese national oil companies will be reluctant to commit to large-scale purchases given this. At the same time, the next two years will also see a slower pace of gas demand growth in China, rising domestic production, and the arrival of Russian pipeline gas, creating a more competitive gas market.', 'The Chinese uncontracted LNG demand is estimated to be 17 Mt in 2020 and 23 Mt in 2021; US off-takers will now be looking to target this market.', 'Contract and portfolio suppliers with contracted supply into China and US off-takers  notably Shell, BP and Cheniere  could also target increasing volumes of US LNG within existing contracts into China, if agreement can be reached with key buyers, including CNOOC and PetroChina.', 'nSource: Wood Mackenzie']"

    "title": "The Bear Case For Oil: Possible Recession",
    "content": "['A year ago, there was near unanimity among pundits, I mean experts, that a recession was quite likely for 2019. The economic expansion was getting long in the tooth, labor markets were very tight, and for a period, the yield curve for bonds was inverted, a near-perfect predictor of looming recession. Added to that, the chaotic nature of U.S. politics and uncertainty created by on-again, off-again tariff policies seemed to suggest expectations of a recession were well-based. ', 'Instead, consumer spending remained strong, the stock market rose sharply, so that the experts sheepishly admitted they got it wrong. (I also made all the above arguments and was equally wrong.) But the lesson is not that the economy is not threatened with recession, but that it simply didnt come last year. Some combination of fiscal stimulus from tax cuts and lower interest rates, lower costs from deregulation, and simple consumer confidence has kept the U.S. economy buoyant.', 'This is not to say that the earlier expectations of a recession were incorrect, just that the timing was misjudged. Anyone who has followed economics for a long time should realize by now that economic principles are almost always valid but with uncertain timing. The uncertainty created by the Administrations volatile policies has not triggered a recessionyet. Low unemployment hasnt triggered inflationyet.', 'Several admittedly fuzzy indicators make me concerned that the likelihood of recession has increased. One long-standing, tongue-in-cheek idea is that when the consensus is that weve conquered the business cycle, expect a recession (aka reality bites). This could be considered valid in an indirect way: economists think the business cycle has been conquered only when an expansion has lasted a long time, and recessions are more likely after a lengthy expansion.', 'Another argument that I have made is when silly expenditures become common, people have too much money, which suggests that assets will probably become over-priced. Past examples include oxygen bars in the 1990s where the well-off go to inhale air supposedly from pristine locations like Antarctica or now, raw water for upwards of $24 a gallon. ', 'Twenty-one years ago, in 1998, I was in a bar in Australia reading Charles Kindlebergers Panics, Manias, and Crashes (yes, Im a wild man) and the Asian financial crisis was underway. I noticed on the cover there was a blurb from Robert Solow to the effect that someday you will find this book relevant to current events. It cracked me up.', 'But the larger point was that Kindleberger noted that many crashes were preceded by an expansion of credit which led to asset inflation, but also debt, which created a later crash. I think of that now watching cable news with the many ads from companies with aps that allow businesses and individuals make loans quickly and easily. Combined with the recent headline World Bank Warns Rapid Increase in Debt, and there is obvious reason for concern.', 'So now, some combination of business uncertainty because of the trade war, consumer worries about a war with Iran, higher interest rates due to rising labor costs, or some black swan event could trigger a new recession, which would put pressure on an already-stressed oil market. But the flip side is that OPEC+, and especially Saudi Arabia, would almost certainly respond with new production cuts. After all, one of the prime motivations for cartels, whoever defined, has been to deal with short-term, transient weakness in demand, to avoid having businesses fail due to external conditions. (Recession cartels have often been used, more in Europe and Japan than the U.S.) While the sustainable long-term oil price is, as always, debatable, current Saudi policy suggests that they would not hesitate in response to downward pressure on oil demand due to a period of economic weakness.', 'nSource: Forbes']"

It was the second extension of that waiver, initially issued in January 2019, when the bulk of US sanctions on Venezuelan oil flows went into effect.', 'The waiver has been extended based on the argument that the presence of US companies is necessary to prevent the complete collapse of Venezuelas oil sector, easing an expected recovery once Maduro was forced out of power.', 'But analysts with ClearView Energy Partners believe that Maduros persistent hold on power and his latest efforts to take over the National Assembly weaken the argument for allowing the waiver to stay in place. And, with a US presidential race approaching, the Trump administration may be increasingly wary of the appearance of going soft on Maduro by offering sanctions leniency, they said.', 'Some analysts believe that Venezuelas oil output, which averaged 700,000 b/d in November, could plunge below 300,000 b/d if the waiver is allowed to expire, making this option an attractive one to Trump administration officials eager to ratchet up pressure on the Maduro regime.', 'But this move will also come with a cost for the Trump administration and may, ultimately, prove ineffective.', 'Any decline in production may be short-lived if Rosneft, or another Russian or Chinese company, takes control of Chevrons Venezuelan assets.', 'Analysts estimate that if Rosneft were to take over Chevrons operations it could return output to current levels within 45 days.', 'Chevron, which has cautioned that ending the waiver could leave a post-Maduro government with an irrevocably damaged oil sector, has recently pushed the argument that an expired waiver would simply benefit Chinese and Russian companies, sources said.', 'If Chevron is forced to leave Venezuela, non-US companies will fill the void and oil production will continue, Ray Fohr, a Chevron spokesman, told S&P Global Platts this week.', 'Refiners move on', 'nWith the status of the waiver unclear, Elliott Abrams, States special representative for Venezuela, told reporters in Washington that the Maduro regimes efforts to undermine democracy would be met with severe penalties from the Trump administration.', 'We are looking at additional sanctions, personal sanctions, economic sanctions that we think will bring more pressure yet on the regime, Abrams said.', 'Sanctions have become a frequent tool of reprimand for the Trump administration, with prohibitions on trade with Iran and North Korea and threats on more.', 'But US oil sanctions on Venezuela will soon be a year old and US refiners have moved on, importing their last Venezuelan barrel in May, according to the US Energy Information Administration. Yet Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro remains in power.', 'Sanctions, analysts believe, may have run their course and the Trump administration may have limited options.', 'There isnt much more room for the administration to ratchet up sanctions against Venezuela, and increased sanctions would anyway be unlikely to spark Maduros fall, said Lisa Viscidi, director of the Inter-American Dialogues energy, climate change and extractive industries program.', 'Analysts believe the next steps may include: new sanctions, targeting specific entities and individuals; an end of sanctions waivers; and legislation by the US Congress.', 'Secondary sanctions on the table', 'nAnalysts have long said the most significant action would be the imposition of secondary sanctions, with the US prohibiting all petroleum trade with PDVSA, Venezuelas state-owned oil company, modeled after secondary sanctions the US has imposed on Iranian crude oil exports.', 'Secondary sanctions are on the table, Viscidi said.', 'Similarly, the US could directly sanction Rosneft, the Russian oil company currently facilitating the bulk of Venezuelas petroleum exports.', 'Back in August, a senior Trump administration official told S&P Global Platts that the US was prepared to sanction Rosneft if it continued to trade crude oil and fuel with PDVSA.', 'But analysts believe the administration has been hesitant to impose sanctions on Rosneft, in addition to imposing broader secondary sanctions, because of the impact such a move may have on the larger global market.', 'Of course the Trump administration has the option to apply secondary sanctions and target Rosneft, but it has proven to be very sensitive to the global repercussions that could entail, said David Voght, managing director of IPD Latin America. Rosneft is clearly bolstering Venezuelan exports, and consequently supporting production, but the company claims that it is doing so within the structure of US sanctions.', 'Abrams with State told reporters that roughly 70% of current Venezuelan oil trade is currently handled by Russian companies, including marketing, financing and facilitating ship-to-ship transfers of oil in order to complicate surveillance.', 'Viscidi said with administration efforts failing to oust Maduro from office, the US Congress is likely to get more involved. One effort may be the Venezuelan Contracting Restriction Act (S. 1151) which was introduced by Senator Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, in April.', 'The bill would prohibit companies operating in Venezuela from contracting with the US government, forcing international oil companies operating in Venezuela to choose between Venezuela and access to the US market.

But, more quietly, its Gulf oil peer ADNOC has also been courting foreign funds  and its efforts compare favourably.', 'Like Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabis economy was hit by a dramatic fall in oil prices in mid-2014, triggering a drive to reduce its dependence on crude. A central part of that has been to reform and modernise state champion ADNOC and attract foreign investment.', 'Unlike Aramcos push for a giant stock market listing, which has been highly publicised and closely watched, ADNOC has gone for a more staggered approach with its fundraising efforts, and there has been little overview of their scope by industry experts.', 'However the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, to give its full name, has raised more than $19 billion over the past three years from overseas investors, according to Reuters calculations based on publicly released size of investments, signing fees and share sales.', 'Thats equivalent to two-thirds of the $29.4 billion that Saudi Aramco raised in the biggest initial public offering (IPO) in history. Despite the record-breaking December listing, the bulk of the shares were sold to domestic investors after foreign institutions baulked at the valuation.', 'ADNOC, which supplies nearly 3% of global oil demand, has for example struck deals with the worlds largest fund manager BlackRock BLK.N and with U.S. investment firm KKR, a rare foray for both into national oil companies in the Middle East.', 'It has also sold stakes in its pipeline infrastructure and refining businesses. See FACTBOX on key deals:', 'While both Gulf state-controlled firms are aiming to replicate the model of oil majors by expanding in downstream, trading and petrochemicals, their funding strategies diverge, said Dmitry Marinchenko, analyst with Fitch rating agency.', 'Aramco is raising funds mainly by conventional borrowing while ADNOC is using more sophisticated forms of funding, including selling minority stakes in subsidiaries, he said. ADNOC is more open to cooperation with international partners.', 'It remains to be seen which approach to attracting investment will prove more fruitful in coming years. But at stake could be the companies ability to successfully diversify from crude production and, more broadly, for the domestic economies that rely on them to weather oil price shocks.', 'The biggest challenge is the uncertainty in the outlook for oil and the growing international scrutiny that all energy companies are facing because of climate change, said Helima Croft, managing director of RBC Capital Markets.', 'PRINCE PUSHES FOR CHANGE', 'nThe reforms have been driven by Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, de-facto ruler of the wider United Arab Emirates. Their roots can be traced back to 2016, when oil prices fell to $30 a barrel, hitting state revenues and exposing how sensitive Abu Dhabi finances were to volatile prices.', 'The crown prince, known as MbZ, appointed ally Sultan al-Jaber as CEO of ADNOC with a plan to restructure the company to make it more efficient and function more like a major than a state monopoly.', 'Al-Jaber swiftly embarked on plans to reshuffle ADNOCs leadership and slashed 5,000 jobs, mainly foreigners, out of its 60,000 employees.', 'It is no easy task to change the course of an organisation viewed as one of the most conservative in the region, however. ADNOCs production depended on decades-old concessions with Western oil majors, some of which have been operating in the UAE since the 1930s, and new deals and foreign investment were uncommon.', 'In April 2016, two months after installing al-Jaber, MbZ made a rare visit to ADNOCs headquarters to deliver a wake-up call to managers and staff.', 'His message, demanding a sharp change in a culture of entitlement, was unexpected in a nation where most citizens expect guaranteed state jobs with long-term security.', 'He told ADNOC employees they should feel no sense of entitlement, and that the UAE cannot be chained to oil price fluctuations anymore, whether at $30 or $100 a barrel, said Haif Zamzam, vice president of transformation and business supply at ADNOC who was present during the crown princes visit.', 'He said You show me your CV and you show me your experience, you show me what you are able to actually do, and you have great opportunities, said Zamzam, who had worked with al-Jaber at state investor Mubadala.', 'The visit sent a message to ADNOCs old guard that he would not brook any opposition, said people familiar with the company.', 'People used to come to ADNOC to clock in and clock out and leave at 2pm, and they expect their children to also work there. That is not the case anymore, said one UAE-based industry source.', 'STRETCHING THE DOLLAR', 'nAl-Jaber, a minister of state and a former CEO at Mubadalas energy unit who holds a PhD in business and economics, was tasked with making ADNOC profitable enough to contribute to the UAEs budget even with lower oil prices.', 'We wanted to challenge the conventional business model of the National Oil Company, he told Reuters in an interview at his office on the 63rd floor of ADNOCs skyscraper HQ.', 'To make it simple  we are in the business of stretching the dollar from every barrel we produce.', 'ADNOC does not publish financial results but, nonetheless, investors appear to like the changes.', 'KKRs investment in 2019, its first as a direct investment in the region, was due to ADNOCs reforms, a spokesman for the U.S. firm said.', 'ADNOC has formed new partnerships with European and Asian energy firms such as Italys Eni ENI.MI and Chinas CNPC to boost its oil, gas and trading businesses, and was the first foreign company with a deal to store oil in Indias strategic reserves.', 'In his drive to emulate oil majors, al-Jaber has lured employees from Total TOTF.PA, Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L and BP BP.L to launch new trading operations. He has also led a change in the way ADNOC plans to change the way it prices its oil by establishing a new crude benchmark.', 'The pace of the reforms has surprised industry players.', 'He transformed the company, said Claudio Descalzi, CEO of Eni, one of ADNOCs newest partners.', 'Al-Jaber stressed the reforms were ongoing.', 'ADNOC plans to invest $45 billion to expand its refining and petrochemicals operations with partners and is looking to boost its international market share for crude and fuel, he said.', 'We dont want only to stick to the known or the traditional partners, said the CEO.

On average, dirty tanker spot freight rates rose by 29% m-o-m on the back of increased tonnage requirements and high bunker prices. In the clean tanker market, increased tonnage was observed in the different routes, leading to an increase in average clean tanker spot freight rates by 18% m-o-m.

    "content": "['It is not too good to be true, it is the economic reality that lies ahead of us. The energy transition facing us in the coming decades is an affordable one. In fact, the future energy system is not only affordable, it is cheaper than the energy system we have today. And this creates an opportunity to invest more to achieve the future we want.', 'Let me be more precise: in just one generation, humanity will be spending a much lower share of its GDP on energy than it does today. The main reason is not energy prices, but energy efficiency. Whether you believe in the phenomenon of peak energy, as DNV GL does, or just increased efficiency, the conclusion is the same, and it is robust.', 'Affordability is reward enough, but there is an even more important win  we are heading towards a decarbonized energy future. But do not pop the champagne yet. Our Energy Transition Outlook (ref. 1) outlines the most likely future as DNV GL sees it. The energy transition, modelled to the best of our ability, is far too slow; we are not on track for a Paris-compliant future.', 'Some of the savings that therefore accrue from a much more efficient energy system need to be ploughed into speeding things up, investing in R&D, technology support, policy incentives and other activities increasing the pace of the transition. And even if society does invest and achieve Paris ambitions, the transition is affordable, purely in energy economic terms. The stakes beyond energy economics are of course far larger; the costs of runaway global warming are close to incalculable.', 'What should count as energy expenditures is open to debate. DNV GLs Energy Transition Outlook uses a strict definition, including only fossil-fuel extraction, refinement and conversion, installation and operation of renewable energy plants, and all costs incurred by the power sector. The definition could have been extended with energy efficiency measures, energy transport costs, and energy support and subsidies. Using our definition, present expenditures are at 4.6 trn USD annually, and will grow in absolute terms to 5.6 trn USD annually in 2050, as illustrated in Figure 1.', 'There are different views of the unit costs of energy going forward. Renewable energy production will inevitably be cheaper, while grid complexity increases and will be more expensive. Fossil energy extraction is helped by technology improvements, but is also moving to more challenging conditions. Without going into details, it is likely that the relative costs of a unit of energy will stay within the same range as today. On a global accumulated level, DNV GL figures show average energy costs slowly increasing from 8 to 10 USD/GJ over the next 30 years.', 'But the world economy is growing at a much faster speed than energy expenditures. With an average expected growth in global GDP of 2.6% per year the global economy will be 130% larger than it is today. Illustrated in Figure 2, this is a story about affordability.', 'Would this conclusion change if we included costs that are excluded from our energy expenditure definitions? No. The costs would add to the absolute costs and percentages, e.g. fossil fuel subsidies today are in the range of 400 bn USD (ref. 2), renewable subsidies at 150 bn USD (ref. 2), and energy efficiency costs at 240 bn USD (ref. 3). The first is likely to decrease the coming decades, the two latter to increase, but the change in the figures will remain too small to alter the overall conclusion.', 'The overarching driver of affordability is energy efficiency. This is best illustrated as improvement in global energy intensity  the global primary energy consumption per unit of GDP. Energy intensity has improved 1.6% per year over the last decades. With increased electrification and more efficient energy end use in all sectors and all regions, we expect global energy intensity reduction to be 2.5% per year on average towards 2050.', 'The shift gives us the watershed moment of peak energy, when humanity  in spite of population and economic growth and great improvements in energy access for poorer populations  will start to use less energy (ref. 4).', 'The main reason for the affordable transition is the reduction  both absolute and relative to economic growth  in global energy use, not changes in energy costs.', 'nThe market, left to its own devices, tends to be short-sighted. Unless forced by rules and regulations, most energy developments are economically rational in the short term. What if we forced the energy system to achieve Paris ambitions, would this be costly? Yes and no.', 'Various references exist on the cost of achieving Paris ambitions. Most of them also include the benefits of reducing climate change damages. However, if we confine ourselves narrowly just to the extra costs involved in decarbonizing the energy system, that could add up to an additional annual cost of 0.4-0.8% of GDP (ref. 5). If we add this number to the GDP share for energy expenditures shown in Figure 2, we see that the transition is still affordable, with a clear margin.', 'The conclusion that the energy transition is affordable is valid even without considering the benefits of avoiding the dangerous consequences of global warming, which obviously are compelling.', 'Something for the COP 25 negotiators to bear in mind!', 'References:', 'nEach week, we will be joined by the worlds leading energy experts to discuss their insights and opinions on how governments, business leaders and wider society can help accelerate the energy transition.', 'The new season has been kickstarted with an interview with Remi Eriksen, Group President and CEO of DNV GL, who explores the key findings from the 2019 Energy Transition Outlook (ETO) report and discusses what more can be done globally to accelerate the energy transition.', 'nSource: DNV GL']"

    "title": "A New Offshore Investment Cycle Is In The Making",
    "content": "['In retrospect, 2019 was another strong year for offshore exploration and production companies. Free cash flow remained strong and telltale signs have emerged that we are entering a new offshore investment cycle. This trend was perhaps illustrated most profoundly by the rising swell of offshore project approval activity by operators in 2019. Globally, the amount of oil and gas resources approved for development last year surpassed 20 billion barrels of oil equivalent (boe), the highest level seen since 2011.', 'A quick look at free cash flow (FCF) levels in recent years confirms that 2019 was a strong year for the offshore sector. Figure 1 shows the total offshore FCF from all public E&P companies globally. This shows that 2019 was the third best year on record, with FCF reaching nearly $90 billion. This represented a slight reduction compared to 2018, but compares very favorably with the previous investment cycle from 2010 to 2014. This shows that the cash flow situation for offshore players is very robust, underlining the point that E&Ps have enough cash in hand to invest in new projects after several years of restrained capital expenditure.', 'This trend is clearly reflected when looking at project approval activity in 2019. Figure 2 provides an overview of total approved offshore resources each year over the past decade, split by liquids and gas. Last year saw the approval of 12.3 billion barrels of liquids projects, along with 8.3 billion boe of new gas projects, thus bringing total approved resources to 20.6 billion boe. Given that the total amount of offshore production in 2019 was 10.1 billion barrels of liquids and 7.0 billion boe of gas, this implies a replacement ratio of 1.2 for both oil and gas. The approved volumes in 2019 were 110% higher than 2018, and the highest number since 2011.', 'Figure 3 shows approved offshore greenfield investments (designated for the development of new projects) by year of sanctioning. Once again, a strong increase in activity is seen in 2019. Total greenfield investments approved last year increased by 50% versus 2018. This significant rise in approved resources and investments was driven by several very large developments that were approved last year, such as the massive Marjan and Berri expansion projects in Saudi Arabia. These projects feature very large resource bases and offer lower greenfield investment cost per boe compared to smaller projects. Measured in dollars, comparing last years investment levels with the years during the previous investment cycle from 2010 through 2014 does not tell the whole story, as cost levels within the E&P industry have come down significantly since 2014.', 'Figure 4 shows the 15 largest offshore projects approved last year, measured by total greenfield capex. The expansion phase of Saudi Aramcos Marjan field in Saudi Arabia was by far the largest project approved last year, with close to $12 billion in investments. The project aims to add 24 new offshore platforms to handle initial oil and gas processing and water injection. These platforms will tie into the onshore expansion of the Tanajib oil facilities, as well as other newly built onshore gas facilities. The second largest project on the list is the first phase of Totals Area 1 development in Mozambique. This gas project will be developed as a subsea tieback to an onshore LNG plant. Chevrons Anchor field development in the US is the largest project within the Atlantic region, just ahead of the second phase of Equinors Johan Sverdrup field in Norway.', 'Unsurprisingly, this rising tide of approval activity has carried with it an increase in offshore investments in 2019. Total offshore capex grew by 5% versus 2018, with a 7% rise in deepwater spending and a 3% boost in investments on the continental shelf. For 2020, offshore investments are on track to grow 8%, with deepwater up 12% and shelf spending up 2% (see Figure 5). This illustrates that a new offshore investment cycle is in the making.', 'nSource: Rystad Energy']"

With tensions peaking after the US and Iran traded missile attacks, oil markets priced in a risk premium. However, as long as the flow of oil barrels to the market is not affected, Rystad Energy continues to see a downward risk to prices, with further pressure on OPEC to implement even deeper production cuts in order to keep Brent oil prices around $60 per barrel through 2020.', 'It is important to look beyond the rhetoric of the headlines and focus on market fundamentals  including the continued rise of non-OPEC oil supply led by US shale, and flat demand growth  which all points to a surplus, not a deficit, in oil balances in 2020, says Bjrnar Tonhaugen, Head of Oil Market Research at Rystad Energy. Prospects of Brent prices slipping below $60 per barrel  even in the midst of an intense geopolitical flare up in the Middle East  are entirely plausible.', 'Oil prices still react dramatically to news of tensions in the Persian Gulf, although less dramatically now than they would have before the US shale revolution. The importance of the region for oil markets is obvious, given that seven Gulf countries alone  Saudi Arabia, Iraq, UAE, Kuwait, Iran, Oman and Qatar  produced around 24 million bpd of crude oil in December 2019.', 'With the regime in Tehran under heavy sanctions, Iran is no longer an official major global oil producer. This means the real risk of a conflict between the US and Iran gets pushed to neighboring Iraq, where 5,000 American troops are stationed and where Iran is wrestling for political power. Any proxy war played out in Iraq would put the countrys nearly 4.7 million bpd of crude oil and condensate production as risk, states Tonhaugen.', 'However, one key reason that geopolitically-driven oil price swings are now more subdued relates to the stabilizing effect of US shale oil production on global oil supplies. The stellar growth of shale has introduced a significant counterweight to the market, as it helps to absorb disruptive events such as the September drone attack on Saudi Arabian oil infrastructure and the geopolitical tensions that followed the assassination of General Soleimani.', 'Rystad Energy forecasts that the call on OPEC (in other words, the market demand for OPEC oil) will average about 28.3 million bpd during the final nine months of 2020.

Even so, very few respondents expect average prices to fall below $50 or rise above $90 at any point in the next five years.', 'Response clustering has been increasing in recent surveys, suggesting the anchoring of long-term expectations around the $65-70 per barrel level is becoming stronger.', 'The longer prices trade around the $65-70 level, with production and consumption roughly in balance, the more expectations are becoming cemented around this level.', 'Over the last 27 months, since the start of November 2017, Brent prices have closed between $60 and $75 per barrel on 74% of all trading days, with just 10% of closes below this level and $16% above it.', 'Overall, most respondents expect the oil market to remain comfortably supplied in the foreseeable future, with prices oscillating around the current level and relatively moderate volatility.', 'nSource: Reuters (Editing by Jan Harvey)']"

BP operates the Andrew assets  comprising the Andrew platform, the Andrew (62.75%), Arundel (100%), Cyrus (100%), Farragon (50%) and Kinnoull (77.06%) fields and associated subsea infrastructure. It holds a 27.5% stake in the Shell-operated Shearwater field. Under the terms of the deal, Premier Oil will pay BP $625 million. Ariel Flores, BP North Sea regional president, said: BP has been reshaping its portfolio in the North Sea to focus on core growth areas, including the Clair, Quad 204 and ETAP hubs. Were adding advantaged production to our hubs through the Alligin, Vorlich and Seagull tieback projects As a result of this focus, we have also now decided to divest our Andrew and Shearwater interests, believing them to be a better strategic fit for another owner.

At that point, he said the challenge would be making sure that other producers can meet the demand that keeps rising.', 'The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects American oil production to average 13.2 million barrels a day (b/d) in 2020, an increase of 0.9 million b/d from the 2019 level. However, growth in supply is slowing from the last few years with 2018 growth of 1.6 million b/d and 2019 growth of 1.3 million b/d.', 'In September 2019, the U.S. exported exported 90,000 b/d more total crude oil and petroleum products than it imported, the first month recorded in U.S. data where it had exported more than it had imported. But in its latest short-term energy outlook released in January, the IEA noted that slowing crude oil production growth will result from a decline in drilling rigs over the past year and that it expected this trend to continue into 2020.', 'Despite the decline in rigs, EIA forecasts (oil) production will continue to grow as rig efficiency and well-level productivity rises, offsetting the decline in the number of rigs, it noted.', 'Shales place in the ecosystem', 'nBenchmark Brent crude is trading around the $65 dollar mark while West Texas Intermediate (WTI) is trading just below the $60 per barrel level. Prices have been more or less stable since oil producer group OPEC, along with Russia and several other producers, curbed their own production to limit supply and rebalance global oil prices.', 'They have done this in the face of (and pressure from) massive U.S. shale oil production, however. There are concerns, especially among the OPEC+ alliance as it is now known, that efforts to stabilize prices are being hampered by growing U.S. supply and a shaky outlook for demand.', 'Jason Bordoff, professor and director at Columbia Universitys Center on Global Energy Policy, characterized U.S. shale oil as a new dynamic of shale in the global market  not just how much of it there is, but how short-cycle it is and how quickly it can respond to market changes, when speaking on the same energy panel on Monday.', 'Saudi Arabias Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said that while OPEC kept a close eye on U.S. shale oil inventories, he was more concerned that producers worked together so the energy market ecosystem was not undermined.', 'Were not focused on shale oil particularly. Id hate to see our endeavor and work in OPEC being challenged by any producer, because at the end of the day we are supporting the industry and we are supporting all producers and were welcoming everybody, as long as they are efficient producers, he said.', 'Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods, who was also on the panel, believed that the challenge that he saw on the supply side of the market was the ability of oil producers to produce efficiently despite volatility in the market.', 'Demand will continue to grow in the decades to come because of the important role that energy and oil and gas plays in modern life  from a supply standpoint, this industry goes through lots of cycles  (one of) which is the shale revolution and the supply that came with that, so were going to see ups and downs, he said.', 'In the period we find ourselves today with ample supply, the challenge is to make sure you can produce this supply at the lowest cost and that youre competitive, irrespective of where the volatility in any one year takes you. Certainly, from our perspective, thats how we think about the business.', 'Our perspective today is that the fundamentals are strong, the demand will be there over time so we have to invest so that were in a position to meet that demand, he added.', 'nSource: CNBC']"

    "content": "['Forty years ago, the conventional wisdom about oil was that we were running out of it and needed to find ways to conserve. Twenty years ago, it was faddish for people in the oil business to talk about the then-assumed fact that all the elephants have been found, with the word elephant referring to massive reserves of crude oil and/or natural gas. I cannot begin to count the number of times I heard that bit of conventional wisdom expressed by speakers at IPAA or API conferences during that period of time around the turn of the century.', 'As things have turned out, there were and are still elephants out there around the world, and the oil and gas industry keeps finding them. A new report from Rystad Energy finds that global oil and gas discoveries outside of the United States in fact reached a 4-year high during 2019, and the vast majority of them had nothing to do with shale or fracking.', 'According to the report, The worlds oil and gas explorers powered ahead and discovered 12.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent (boe) in 2019, the highest volume since 2015, according to estimates from Rystad Energy. Last year recorded 26 discoveries of more than 100 million boe, with offshore regions dominating the list of new oil and gas deposits.', 'By far the largest, in terms of discovered oil resource, of the offshore regions to which the report refers was the Stabroek block offshore Guyana, the small nation adjacent to Venezuela on the north-central coast of South America. There, a consortium comprised of ExxonMobil, Hess and CNOOC announced four major new discoveries during 2019. Tullow Oil also announced two major discoveries on its own acreage to the west of Stabroek during the year. All told, Rystad Energy estimates that the discoveries in Guyana hold cumulative recoverable resources of around 1.8 billion boe.', 'Of course, the 2019 numbers do not include last weeks announced major new discovery offshore Suriname  just to the East of Guyana  by Houston-based Apache Corp. and French giant T0tal. Obviously, this north-central South America region holds great promise for the future.', 'But this story is not just about crude oil  2019 was also characterized by an array of new natural gas discoveries. The largest of those were drilled in Russia and Mauritania, both of which were home to over 1.3 billion boe in natural gas finds. Additional major natural gas resources were discovered in Iran, Cyprus, South Africa and Malaysia.', 'So, while the oil and natural gas booms in U.S. shale in general and the Permian and Marcellus Shale basins specifically tend to get the lions share of the energy-related news attention here in the United States, its important to know that another boom is taking place internationally, one that helps to ensure the worlds future energy security.', 'Meanwhile, back in the United States  None of this is to discount the impacts of the Shale Revolution, which has radically shifted the global energy picture over the past decade. In fact, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) published a new report of its own Monday morning, documenting the record-setting levels of proved oil and natural gas reserves and production that came about in the U.S. during 2018, the most current year for which complete data is available.', 'The EIA finds that U.S. 2018 production of oil and lease condensate grew by a whopping 17% over 2017 levels, while natural gas volumes for 2018 were up by 12%. Reserve additions also grew dramatically during the year, with proved oil reserves surpassing the previous record set in 2017 by 12%, and reserves of natural gas rising by 9% year-over-year.', 'While the U.S. boom obviously did slow during 2019, it is important to note that represents just a slowing in the rate of increase, not an overall contraction. The EIAs current data indicates that October 2019 U.S. oil production (the most recent month available) was 627,000 bopd higher than in December 2018. U.S. natural gas production, meanwhile, rose by more than 10% between December 2018 and October 2019.', 'So, bottom line, the world is in the midst of the one of the largest oil and natural gas booms of modern times. It is a boom that will continue to promote global prosperity and security for many years to come.', 'nSource: Forbes']"

    "content": "['The level of uncertainty and anxiety among upstream producers and supply chain has rarely been higher. ', 'In 2020, decision-making will be more heavily influenced by sentiment surrounding the energy transition, political upheaval and trade disputes than in previous years.', 'This adds to the ever-present risks of unexpected supply-demand imbalance, niche cost inflation or a global economic downturn. ', 'What are the biggest trends to watch in the upstream oil and gas business in 2020? Fraser McKay, head of upstream analysis at Wood Mackenzie, sees five key themes: ', 'tUpstream capex spend will remain flat;', 'ntSanctioned volumes will be huge, and gas weighted;', 'ntExcess supply chain capacity keeps costs lower for longer;', 'ntTight oil will slow down, but once again be resilient;', 'ntExploration will be under real pressure but will create value.', 'He said: Despite funding concerns and pressure from investors and stakeholders regarding capital discipline and the energy transition, upstream development spend will remain flat for the second year in a row, totalling about US$450 billion, excluding non-integrated LNG plant spend. ', 'Change in emphasis', 'Flat year-on-year spend belies a near-term shift in resource theme emphasis. McKay said: Digging into our new Lensplatform, we find spend on conventional projects still dominates, accounting for 50% of global upstream capex.  ', 'But an avalanche of future spend on liquefied natural gas (LNG) supply is being triggered by project sanctions in 2019 and in 2020. Spend on upstream LNG supply will be up 50% year-on-year to over US$30 billion in 2020. ', 'US unconventional oil and gas is the loser in gross spend terms in the near-term. The pursuit of free cash flow will force even greater capital restraint among the pure-play tight oil and shale gas producers. Spend on shale will fall by more than 10% in 2020.  ', 'While annual capex will remain flat, some of the projects likely to be sanctioned this year are huge.', 'McKay said: A staggering 34 billion barrels of oil equivalent of resource and US$220 billion of total future development spend is held within the 40 projects we consider most likely to be sanctioned in 2020.   ', 'Making the transition', 'For the second year in a row, two-thirds of the total resource comprises gas. This demonstrates industry belief in gas as a transition fuel that still has decades of running room. ', 'We expected a record year for LNG project sanctions in 2019. Operators didnt disappoint, with 63 million tonnes per annum of new capacity given the green light, half of which was in the US.  ', 'Capacity additions in 2020 are harder to call, with sanction decisions for gas projects of this scale increasingly tough to make. ', 'Capital efficiency will continue to be a focus this year. McKay said: The window for upstream producers to lock-in low development costs for new projects will extend into 2020 and beyond in most sectors.', 'For the supply chain, that means business will continue to be hard-fought and margins will remain under pressure; the nadir has longer to run. ', 'Apart from isolated hot spots, the service sector will need to adjust and consolidate in 2020 as finances are stretched still further. Capacity will gradually reduce, either via consolidation or equipment retirements.  ', 'He added: We also expect more supply chain companies to pivot away from pure upstream services, towards other parts of the oil and gas value chain or renewables. Only the most cost competitive or innovative will find a way to adapt. ', 'Tricky times for tight oil?', 'The US tight oil sector will once again be a topic of much debate this year. Independent tight oil producers have their backs against the wall.', 'The to-do list in 2020 is arduous: deliver cash flow to repay debt and solve parent/child well interference.', 'McKay said: It all adds up to a slowdown in activity and healthy dose of scepticism from onlookers and investors. So, is 2020 the year tight oil finally falters? ', 'Maybe not. Production wont surge like it has in past years, but the Independents could surprise one final time.', 'How? We will be watching operators spacing patterns in Lens Lease Evaluator and completion designs in Lens Well Evaluator for signs of outperformance.  ', 'The shift to drilling exclusively extended reach lateral (XRL) wells could prove meaningful. Producers can grow volumes 15% more efficiently with XRLs. Increased well spacing and further high-grading to exclusively core inventory would compound the effect. ', 'This could mean a surprise to the upside for production and cash flow in 2020. But it also means depleting core inventory significantly faster. And an even harder landing if the same pressures are exerted on producers in 2021. ', 'Major role', 'We expect the exploration sector to create value again in 2020, despite facing a growing battle for support as companies and investors question the need for new resources.', 'The industry will definitely not spend more than 2019, and spend could fall further, as cost efficiencies continue and a few more explorers drift away from the sector. ', 'McKay said: The Majors are likely to remain prominent in high-impact exploration plays, though one or more might announce a strategic move away from wildcatting in favour of brownfield growth or new energy businesses.', 'By contrast, national oil companies have been slowly increasing their exploration market share and this trend looks likely to continue in 2020. ', 'Smaller players face the double whammy of waning investor appetite and, even when they are successful, fewer industry buyers for their pre-FID discoveries.', 'The exploration-only business model faces extinction.

U.S. proved reserves of crude oil and lease condensate rose to 47.1 billion barrels in 2018, a 12% increase compared with the previous record set at year-end 2017 of 42 billion barrels. U.S. proved reserves of natural gas rose to 504.5 trillion cubic feet (Tcf), a 9% increase compared with the record level set in 2017 of 464.4 Tcf. The growth in oil and natural gas proved reserves was driven by an increase in 2018 oil and natural gas prices.', 'Proved reserves are those volumes of oil and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions.', 'A favorable price environment in 2018 with relatively higher oil and natural gas prices drove the record U.S. oil and natural gas proved reserve levels. Higher fuel prices can often increase the proved reserves estimates because a larger portion of the oil or natural gas resource base can be economically producible.

Operators produced 89.9 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of marketed natural gas per day in 2018, 10 Bcf/d more than in 2017.', 'Texas saw the largest net increase in oil and natural gas proved reserves of all states in 2018, totaling 2.3 billion barrels of crude oil and lease condensate proved reserves and 22.9 Tcf of natural gas proved reserves. The largest share of the increase was produced in the Wolfcamp and Bone Spring shale plays in the Permian Basin.', 'The next-largest net gains in natural gas proved reserves in 2018 were in Pennsylvania and New Mexico. Pennsylvanias natural gas proved reserves increased by 14.2 Tcf and New Mexicos increased by 4.2 Tcf in 2018.

    "title": "Energy Sector Predictions For 2020",
    "content": "['We begin 2020 with the stock market again testing record highs. We just finished a year in which oil prices rose by more than 30%. However, natural gas prices closed the year nearly 40% lower, emphasizing the extent to which these two commodities have become unlinked.', 'Its also an election year. Those tend to inject additional unpredictability into the markets, as short-term decisions are often made to influence voters (e.g., releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to drive gasoline prices lower).', 'Against this backdrop, its harder for me to get a clear handle on the trends in the energy markets this year. Nevertheless, there are some disconnects in the market that I believe are likely to correct this year. I believe there are some high probability predictions we can make based on those disconnects.', 'Below are my predictions for some of the significant energy trends I expect this year. As I usually point out, the discussion behind the predictions is more important than the predictions themselves. Thats why I provide extensive background and reasoning behind the predictions.', 'I also make predictions that are specific and measurable. At years end, there are specific metrics that will indicate whether a prediction was right or wrong.', '1. For the first time since 2014, the closing price of WTI will not drop below $50/bbl', 'Oil is still the worlds most important commodity, so I always try to lead off with a prediction on the direction of oil prices. I generally make this prediction by looking at supply and demand trends, as well as inventory levels. I also usually do a sanity check of my prediction by reviewing predictions from other analysts.', 'Over the past few years, we started the year with an oil price that I felt was too low. So my prediction in recent years was for higher prices. This year, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) opened at $61.17 per barrel (bbl), and averaged $56.98/bbl for the year. The year has only started above $60/bbl one other time since the downturn of 2014-2015. In 2018 the year opened at $60.37/bbl, and it ran up to just over $75/bbl before ending the year below $50/bbl.', 'The Energy Information Administration (EIA) expects crude oil prices to be lower on average this year, because of forecast rising global oil inventories in the first half of 2020.', 'In contrast, JP Morgan is projecting an oil market deficit this year of 200,000 BPD, because of OPEC production cuts and demand growth in emerging markets. They expect oil demand to grow by 1 million BPD globally, which is consistent with most other forecasts.', 'U.S. crude oil inventories are about average for this time of year. Global inventories are slightly below the five-year average.', 'I believe there is a disconnect in the oil market between expectations and reality. There are lots of expectations that we are on the cusp of peak oil demand, but in reality I think we are still several years from that. Nevertheless, those expectations are creating headwinds for oil prices. But the only way the market corrects those expectations is for crude inventories to decline. Given the strong growth in U.S. shale oil in recent years, that just hasnt happened.', 'Thats a lot of verbiage to set up the prediction, but there are a lot of moving parts here. Ultimately, I believe OPEC will continue to cut production in order to prop up oil prices. I think U.S. shale production growth is going to continue to slow (next prediction), and that global oil demand will once again growth to a new record high.', 'But the oil markets looks to be pretty balanced this year on average. That argues for modest oil price movements. In any case, crude inventories arent high, and I believe OPEC will continue to cut production in order to prop up oil prices.', 'Some have called for oil prices to imminently collapse in the face of peak oil demand. I dont believe prices will go much lower than they are presently in 2020. In fact, for the first time since 2014, I dont believe they will drop below $50/bbl.', '2. U.S. oil production growth will fall below 1.0 million BPD', 'According to the EIA, U.S. oil production closed 2019 at 12.9 million BPD. For all of 2019, production averaged 12.2 million BPD. To put that in perspective, thats a higher production rate for crude oil than any other country has ever had.', 'But production growth in 2019  1.2 million BPD year-over-year  was significantly less than 2018s record 1.6 million BPD gain. And there is a lot more pressure on oil companies to deliver cash flow to investors. That is going to increase the incentive to focus on producing instead of drilling new wells.', 'Thus, I think shale production growth will fall below 1.0 million BPD this year versus last year. Thats also supportive of the previous prediction.', '3. The average natural gas price will be at the lowest level in more than 20 years.', 'Last year I passed on making a natural gas prediction, because I saw too much uncertainty in the market. What ultimately happened was a steady decline in natural gas prices, which dropped below $2.00/MMBtu by the end of the year. The average price for 2019 was $2.56/MMBtu. Thats not much above the $2.52/MMBtu price recorded in 2016, which represented the lowest price since 1999.', 'The problem with the natural gas markets is similar to the problem in the oil market. Demand growth has been strong, but supply growth has been much stronger. And natural gas cant be transported as easily as oil, so prices have been hit even harder.', 'Natural gas production growth flattened in 2016 in response to low prices. The same thing is likely to happen in 2020 as a result of low prices. But production growth was extremely strong in 2019, and that momentum will carry over into early 2020. That means prices will remain under pressure for a while.', 'Another important piece of the puzzle is natural gas inventories, but those are average for this time of year. Thus, I dont see prices bouncing back as they did in 2017 and 2018. I think its likely that we see another year of depressed natural gas prices. In fact, I believe this year they will drop below the 2016 average price, which would mark the lowest level in more than 20 years.', '4. On average, the U.S. will be a net exporter of crude oil plus finished products for the first time', 'In 2018, Bloomberg reported that the U.S. had become a net crude oil exporter for the first time in 75 years. That was inaccurate. It was actually for the sum of crude oil exports and finished products, and that was for only one week.', 'In September 2019, that feat was achieved on a monthly basis for the first time. However, the average for the year through October still showed the U.S. to be a net importer to the tune of 755,000 BPD.', 'In 2020, I predict the net import number will be switched to a net export number for the year overall. There are likely to be months that are still in the net import category, but I think the year overall will switch into the net export category. To be clear, the U.S. will remain a net importer of crude oil in 2020. If that picture changes, it wont do so for at least a couple more years.', '5. ConocoPhillips will have a total return of at least 20%', 'Oil prices rose by more than 30% last year. But ConocoPhillips  the worlds largest publicly traded, pure oil and gas producer  had a total return of 6.6%. That might be reasonable if COP had a bad year. But it didnt.', 'Since the deep downturn in 2015, the company has increased cash flow each year. In fact, today ConocoPhillips is generating more cash flow with oil prices in the $50s than it was in 2013 when oil prices were over $100.', 'Net debt is a quarter of what it was just three years ago, but the companys oil and gas resource that breaks even at a $40 WTI price has increased by 50%.', 'Over the next decade, the company projects a total return to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks of $50 billion. This is substantial, given the current market cap of $65 billion.', 'I expect the market to recognize COPs value in 2020, and for the company to return at least 20% for the year.', 'There you have my 2020 energy sector predictions. This year is challenging to read because there are so many important variables in motion. But as always, I will grade them at the end of the year.', 'nSource: Forbes']"

    "title": "The real price of Occidentals costless oil hedge",
    "content": "['In just 12 days, Occidental Petroleum Corp pulled off one of the biggest hedges against falling oil prices ever placed by a U.S. energy company. It characterized the transaction as costless but a Reuters review of regulatory filings, market data and interviews shows thats not the whole story.', 'The aim of the complex financial maneuver, the company said, was to help preserve Occidentals generous dividend to shareholders as it sought to take over rival Anadarko Petroleum for $38 billion last summer in the biggest industry deal for years.', 'With the additional leverage from the Anadarko acquisition, these new hedges will strengthen our 2020 cash flow in a low oil price environment, and provide additional assurance that our dividend is safe, while we are deleveraging, Occidentals Chief Financial Officer Cedric Burgher told an earnings call in August.', 'However, to secure the hedge swiftly and discreetly and to avoid paying its bankers a fee for arranging it, the company took a bigger potential hit to future revenues with only limited protection against falling oil prices, according to a source with direct knowledge of the transaction.', 'While Occidental disclosed the financial details of the hedge in filings, fulfilling its regulatory obligations, the fact that the company took on the additional risk to secure the transaction fast and to avoid banker fees has not been previously reported.', 'Occidental declined to comment for this story.', 'Hedges are used by a variety of companies. Airlines use them to protect against rising fuel prices and energy producers use them to lock in revenue, usually by buying a put option, a type of derivative contract, which gives them the right to sell oil at a predetermined future price.', 'Occidental used a complex series of transactions for its hedge, which was arranged by Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citigroup, according to six sources with direct knowledge of the trades. The summer hedge covered nearly 110 million barrels of oil, or 300,000 barrels a day, each for 2020 and 2021, nearly enough to meet the annual oil imports of Australia.', 'Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citigroup declined to comment.', 'The hedge meant the firm could sell the oil at a minimum of $55 a barrel in 2020, even if crude prices fell below that, to a limit of $45 a barrel; but the companys selling price was capped at $74.09, and it would lose out on any revenue earned from oil prices rising beyond that mark.', 'Occidental capped revenues for 2020 and also 2021 but only got downside protection for 2020  a lopsided deal sometimes referred to as a naked hedge. Limiting future revenue without getting a guarantee against falling prices is unusual in the energy sector.', 'While Occidental has disclosed the details of the 2020 hedge in regulatory filings, the absence of a hedge against falling oil prices in 2021 was not explicitly mentioned. The company said the 2021 options were meant to increase the maximum selling price it would receive for 2020 sales.', 'Occidental entered into the 2021 call options to substantially improve the ceiling price that the Company will receive for the contracted commodity volumes in 2020, it said in a filing.', 'Some analysts said investors should have been given more information about the potential implications of the hedge.', 'It seems very strange that they left a naked hedge in 2021 which capped upside but offered no downside protection, said David Katz, president and CIO of Matrix Asset Advisors, which owns 0.3% of Occidentals shares.', 'However, other analysts said Occidental needed to secure a hedge quickly to defuse some of the pressure from investors.', 'Doing this gives Oxy a lot of flexibility in 2020 with cash flow, said Trisha Curtis, President of PetroNerds, an energy analytics and advisory firm specializing in U.S. shale.', 'You cant have an acquisition that big and then willy-nilly hope that oil prices hold up. Regardless of what it cost them, it was needed for a number of reasons.', 'REVENUE-LIMITING OPTIONS', 'Occidental has said publicly that it does not regularly hedge its oil sales because it does not want to give up potential revenue. The last time the company hedged was in 2005, also following an acquisition.', 'In the summer of 2019, Occidental was under pressure to demonstrate that its dividend was being protected.', 'Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn was campaigning against the Anadarko deal and Anadarko itself had issued a regulatory filing on July 29 saying its calculations showed that Occidental, even without an acquisition, would not be able to generate enough cash to pay its dividend for the next three years.', 'Occidental executives wanted to be able to announce the hedge to reassure investors when they presented second-quarter results on July 31, according to three sources with direct knowledge of the transaction.', 'Bank of America and Citigroup had been advising Occidental on the Anadarko acquisition. Now their traders had about two weeks to complete the hedge.', 'Acting on Occidentals behalf, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citigroup sold two types of derivative contracts, with the intention of using the proceeds from the sales to fund the purchase of a put option locking in Occidentals oil revenues at $55 a barrel for 2020, according to the six sources.', 'In illiquid private markets, big transactions are more difficult, and therefore more expensive, to execute. If rival traders get wind of a deal before it is fully executed, they could get in first with their own buy or sell orders, pushing up or down the target price.', 'In the case of Occidentals hedge, the large volume of oil and the tight time frame to insure it meant the banks were not going to be able to raise enough money from selling derivative contracts for 2020 alone to cover the cost of the hedge, the first source said.', 'To fill the gap and avoid having to present Occidental with a large bill, the banks sold similar revenue-limiting options for 2021, the source said.', 'Selling the 2021 options also increased the amount of money the banks could make because they were selling additional contracts on Occidentals behalf.', 'Derivatives trades require only minimal disclosure and it is unclear how much of a profit the banks made from the Occidental deal.', 'Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citigroup declined to comment.', 'In the first week of 2020, international oil prices spiked by around 9% to nearly $72 a barrel due to heightened tensions in the Middle East. They have since fallen back to around $65, $2 above the price they are expected to average out at over 2020, according to the most recent Reuters poll.', 'If those expectations pan out, Occidental will not miss out on potential profits, so the bet would work out. On the other hand, if oil prices were to surge again, and remain above $74 a barrel, the cost to Occidental could translate to millions of dollars a month in lost revenues, even at just $1 above the price cap.', 'Despite the hedge underpinning its dividend, Occidental shares have fallen by nearly a third since April, when its interest in Anadarko first became public.', 'nSource: Reuters (Additional reporting by Imani Moise in New York; Editing by David Gaffen, Greg Roumeliotis and Carmel Crimmins.)']"

It is to enable a proper planning for future capital expenditure to be conducted using predictable parameters rather than projecting numbers in an extreme environment. That said, we understand that most E&P producers are comfortable at the current US$60-US$70pb oil price level as current production costs range from US$30-US$40pb for offshore production while for onshore production, the cost is even lower which will ensure the current upbeat momentum of offshore and onshore activities will be sustained.', 'Hence, looking at the current operating climate we reiterate our view that local O&G service companies involved in drilling, fabrication and vessel providers (floating production storage and offloading [FPSO] and offshore support vessels) will continue to benefit from the upbeat offshore activities going into 2020. For the upstream services segment, we remain bullish on Dayang Enterprise Bhd (buy; target price [TP]: RM2.69) as the company can expect to benefit from its synergy with Perdana Petroleum Bhd in providing vessels to E&P players and more active offshore maintenance works. We also like Bumi Armada Bhd (buy; TP: 56 sen) due to its improving operational conditions as well as its position as the largest FPSO provider in Malaysia. We are also favourable towards Dialog Group Bhd (buy; TP: RM3.83) specifically due to its stable recurring income from its tank farm business and due to it being one of the main beneficiaries of the soon-to-be operational Pengerang Integrated Petroleum Complex.', 'For the downstream sub-sector of the O&G industry, we remain positive on Petronas Chemicals Group Bhd (buy; TP: RM8.77), Petronas Dagangan Bhd (buy; TP: RM27.75) and Gas Malaysia Bhd (buy; TP: RM3.11) as despite industry-specific challenges, we opine that demand for downstream products remains robust and that external disruptions are temporary in nature which will not halt the respective companies growth going forward.', 'nSource: The Edge Financial Daily']"

The most obvious is the heightening of regional geopolitical tensions since Soleimanis killing by the US. The second relates to a prolonged period of subdued oil demand in the global energy markets, led by the protracted US-China trade war.', 'Following the Soleimani killing, global oil prices surged 3-4% on fears of war in the region and long-term disruption to Middle East oil supplies. Share prices of international oil companies such as BP, Shell and ExxonMobil also jumped. The fact that Aramco shares fell when concerns about disruption to oil supplies should have seen them rise confirms that geopolitical issues will be an ongoing and significant factor in the way investors look at not just Saudi Aramco, but all Saudi companies. Indeed, that is the way the markets look at all companies with major exposure to the region.', 'As with the Aramco IPO process, which saw international investors unwilling to accept Riyadhs valuation of Saudi Arabias national oil company, this is deeply frustrating for Riyadh. The kingdom has rightly targeted a much higher valuation for its prime national asset, which is the worlds biggest producer of oil, but it is almost powerless to control the investment risk that comes from the geopolitics of the region.', 'In trying to understand the recent movements in Aramcos share price, we must allow for the fact that Aramco shares were launched for the first time on 11 December. Immediately following the IPO, Aramcos share price was boosted by a combination of local enthusiasm to invest in the regions most important company, Riyadhs aggressive promotion of the IPO, and by the extension of the Opec+ alliances production cuts in early December, which lifted oil prices.', 'However, with the structural picture suggesting that an underlying equation of weak crude demand and oversupply of oil is set to continue to impede oil prices in 2020, it was always likely that we would see the Aramco share price fall back from its initial surge.

It means that this region matters, and theres only certain countries that can provide additional barrels if its needed on the market.', 'In 2018, Saudi Arabia was the second-biggest source of US oil imports after Canada, accounting for 9% of the total, according to the EIA.', 'OPECS ROLE', 'nOPEC, which pumps about one-third of the worlds crude supply, represented 17% of total US oil imports in May, according to the EIA.', 'And so we still need  if were going to have a disruption we will still be looking to Saudi Arabia to make up for it, if we dont want to draw from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve, Croft said.', 'OPEC has spare oil capacity ranging between 3-3.5 million b/d, with two thirds of that figure present in Gulf countries, the secretary general of the organization, Mohammad Barkindo, told reporters last week. The EIA, using a tighter definition, estimates global spare production capacity at 1.63 million b/d, all held by OPECs Middle East members.', 'Crofts comments were echoed by Amos Hochstein, senior vice president, marketing, of Tellurian and a former top energy diplomat under the previous administration of Barack Obama.', 'I dont feel comfortable with the concept of US energy independence, Hochstein said. Its become more and more of a frequent mantra in the United States that I just dont feel is accurate for exactly the reason that Helima just said, which is a disruption anywhere has impacts everywhere and thats including the United States.', 'Hochstein said the US still relies on energy imports and will continue to do so.', 'We still import because we have balances in the market and we import what we dont produce instead of making significant costly changes to our slates and refineries to just use the American crude, he added.', 'IRAQ SUPPLIES', 'nAnalysts at the forum also warned that potential supply disruptions in Iraq, where the US killed a top Iranian commander prompting retaliatory strikes from Tehran on US troops stationed in bases in the country, wont be easy to make up as was the case after the September 14 attacks in Saudi Arabia.', 'But if you had a situation like that in Iraq, an attack on an Iraqi facility, I dont think its clear at all that they have the type of redundancies that they could recover from it, again, Croft said. And so I do think that we still have to be concerned about the Iranians going back to the more shadow wars in terms of the effects that could have on infrastructure, and Iraq is where I am most concerned.', 'Iraq, OPECs second-largest oil producer, said last week that it is producing 4.46 million b/d, in line with its OPEC quota, without any disruption to output or exports from recent events.', 'The armed drone attack on two key Saudi Aramco facilities in September temporarily knocked down nearly 5 percent of the worlds global oil supply, but production and capacity were back to normal by November, Saudi officials said at the time.', 'There is a lot more risk to energy infrastructure, pipelines, terminals, export facilities, tankers throughout the Gulf, Hochstein said. And this idea that we can have it both ways; that we can have audiences in this room and across New York and London trading floors that can say I truly believe there is not going to be a resolution to the conflict between the United States and Iran. And I truly believe that the price of oil will remain exactly the same as it is today, I think is a bit of a wishful thinking.', 'nSource: ', 'nttttttttttntttttnttttttttt']"

    "content": "['Crude oil traders who bet on a major price surge after U.S.-Iran tensions flared last week ended up losing big as those tensions subsided.', 'Dan Dicker, a veteran energy trader and found of The Energy Word, tells Yahoo Finance that the prevalence of algorithmic trading today has made it that much more challenging for human traders.', 'Oil prices drop', 'nBrent crude prices (BZ=F) posted a weekly decline of 5% Friday, settling at $64.98 per barrel and below levels from before the U.S. airstrike that took out Iranian general Qassem Soleimani on Jan. 3. Domestic West Texas intermediate (CL=F) posted a weekly decline of more than 6% to $59.04 a barrel, representing the largest weekly drop since July.', 'The declines more than reversed momentary spikes in both Brent and WTI crude prices last week, when concerns that Iran might retaliate with a hit to Middle East oil infrastructure sent investors scrambling to price in a supply risk premium.', 'But that quick reversal in price action may have been premature, according to Dicker.', 'I think that traders ultimately may get bit in the backside because theres such passivity to geopolitical risk, Dicker told Yahoo Finances The Final Round. I was biting my fingernails  maybe a lot of people were  that, you know, in fact, if there were casualties from the reprisal strike from the Iranians that Trump might, you know, puff his chest out and toss a bomb at Tehran and wed be in the middle of, you know, a sector-wide war that involved more than just the U.S. and Iran.', 'Instead, President Donald Trump announced Wednesday that he would be retaliating against Iran with sanctions, rather than escalating a military confrontation. The apparent easing of tensions with Iran sent oil prices down immediately.', 'Just because, you know, a president comes out, you know, the next morning and says, Im not going to take a retaliatory move quite yet  I mean, all of a sudden oil drops $3.50, Dicker said. That, to me, is a tremendous change over the way that oil markets used to react to news like this even as much as five years ago and 10 years ago.', 'Theyre momentum seekers', 'nA key reason, Dicker said, boils down to who is  and is no longer  actually facilitating oil trades. Up until recently, there were a lot more humans that were in the pipeline in terms of who was moving the markets, who was putting bets down, who was playing far out on the curve and who wasnt, he said.', 'But that dynamic has changed, and so too has oil price action in response to geopolitical shocks.', 'Now were swamped by machines, and theyre momentum searchers. And ultimately, you know, when something comes out, no matter what the price is  whether its considered to be bullish news or bearish news  there seems to be a pile-on factor, Dicker said.', 'Instead of humans playing the market, there really are machines playing the market, he added. And yes, weve all had to become used to that, because those traders who have been playing the game as if it were, you know, 2010 or 2000 or 1995 have gotten their heads handed to them.', 'Were all kind of forced into this very kind of passive kind of idea about oil prices being unmovable by geopolitics, Dicker said.', 'That said, many economists have pointed out that this weeks earlier oil price spikes were also capped due to the perception that a Middle East supply shock would do less to hamper overall supply, given an existing supply glut and surging domestic production.', 'A similar phenomenon took place last September, when Brent crude oil prices spiked 15%  but then quickly receded  after a drone strike the U.S. blamed on Iran hit Saudi oil infrastructure and temporarily took out about 5% of global daily oil production.', 'Now, if something would actually come out that would actually really put some supply at risk, youd see markets spike in a way that youd never see them spike before, Dicker said.', 'The machines are so far behind the curve when it comes to this that when some real momentum of real supply issues come up, youre going to see them spike prices  not, you know, $10 or $7, but more like $25 or $30. And that would happen in only several days. Thats what youre really looking at, Dicker said.', 'nSource: Yahoo Finance']"

It depends on who you ask, but I think the consensus is that that $60-70/b is OK for producers and for consumers.', 'Front-month ICE Brent closed Friday at $64.98/b, and OPEC and its allies will be closely watching the benchmark in the lead-up to their next meeting March 5-6 in Vienna, when they will decide whether to deepen, ease or extend their production cut accord, said Obiang, who represents OPECs smallest producer.', 'OPEC, Russia and nine other countries are in the fourth year of output cuts aimed at supporting prices, with the current deal calling on the 24 countries to cut 1.7 million b/d through the end of March.', 'We are saying that the right price is between $60/b and $70/b, Obiang said. Anything lower than $60/b creates problems for us. Anything above $70/b we understand will not be good for the consumer. If we do the evaluation and that [current] price continues, we should be maintaining the deal.', 'OPEC ministers are largely loathe to comment on prices, for fear of triggering complaints of anti-competitive collusion. In particular, the US Congress has been considering legislation that would allow the US Justice Department to sue OPEC under antitrust law for manipulating oil prices.', 'On Saturday, UAE energy minister Suhail al-Mazrouei focused his OPEC comments at the forum on the blocs desire to prevent market volatility.', 'The current round of production cuts is aimed at avoiding a supply glut that many forecasters had predicted for the first quarter of 2020, he said.', 'We are meeting in March to discuss any measures that we need to do, Mazrouei said. The objective for all of us in OPEC and OPEC+ is not to achieve a certain price. The objective is to maintain the market balance, so investors can invest.', 'Obiang said a stable price band helps his country plan for development. Equatorial Guineas 2020 budget is based on a conservative assumption of $51/b, he said.', 'The West African producer, which Obiang said was currently producing 120,000 b/d of crude, is expecting to boost output by 20,000 b/d by the end of 2020 as new projects at its Aseng and Ceiba fields ramp up and offset declines from its Zafiro and Alba fields. If the OPEC+ cuts are extended beyond March, that increase would put the country over its quota of 122,000 b/d in the OPEC+ deal.', 'We will have to evaluate what we do, Obiang said. In the meantime, lets see what happens in March.', 'EXPANSION PLANS', 'nThe minister said Equatorial Guinea expects to announce by June which company will take over ExxonMobils license in the mature Zafiro field.', 'The American major still has three years left on its contract but is seeking to divest its holdings in the country.', 'Output at the aging field, producing since 1996, has been steadily falling, and Obiang said the new operator will be expected to invest a minimum of $1 billion to stem the decline. He estimated that the field still contains reserves of some 1 billion barrels.', 'ExxonMobil has discovered gas condensates in the south of the field, which could be included in the package that the company plans to divest, Obiang said.', 'Equatorial Guinea also plans to announce in April a new licensing round that will consist of four to five blocks, he added.', 'Meanwhile, construction of two modular oil refineries that will process at least 20,000 b/d each should begin by the end of this year, Obiang said.

    "content": "['All the countries in the Gulf region have an interest in keeping the Strait of Hormuz, which sits between Oman and Iran, open as an export route, says Ed Crooks Vice-Chair, Americas.', 'In this weeks Energy Pulse:', 'nOil prices spiked after the US killed senior Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike, and after Iran retaliated against US bases in Iraq, but quickly fell back again. The heightened tensions in the Gulf region have focused attention on the risk of disruption to oil tankers passing through the Strait of Hormuz, a critical artery for global supplies, and raised questions over Iraqs plans for strong growth in its production. In other news, Suriname has emerged as a potential new hot-spot for oil development, Mexicos president has suggested subsidies to foreign renewables companies could be cut, and the US oil industry group has set out its agenda for the coming year. Plus smart reads on the crisis in the Gulf and its implications for oil and gas, and a fresh perspective on the pace of energy transitions.', 'Back in September, when missiles and drones apparently launched from Iran hit oil processing facilities at Abqaiq and Khurais in Saudi Arabia, crude prices surged immediately before quickly falling back. So far, the oil markets response to the US killing of Qassem Soleimani, leader of the Quds Force of Irans Islamic Revolutionary Guards, has been very similar. Brent crude briefly spiked over $70 a barrel on Monday, and again early on Wednesday following the Iranian reprisal attack on two US air bases in Iraq. But by Thursday afternoon, oil prices were back down below their levels before the strike on Soleimani. The Wall Street Journal reflected a widely-shared view when it reported that the US and Iran had backed away from open conflict. Tensions in the Gulf region remain high, however, and the Financial Times warned there appeared to be no end to the hostilities.', 'The regions critical vulnerability for global energy supplies is the Strait of Hormuz between Oman and Iran, described by the US Energy Information Administration as the worlds most important oil transit chokepoint. About a fifth of global oil consumption and a quarter of the international trade in liquefied natural gas passed through the strait in 2018, and there has been widespread speculation over whether Iran could try to close it to tanker traffic. That seems unlikely, however: all the countries in the Gulf region have an interest in keeping the Strait open as an export route. Decades of history have shown that even during periods of intense conflict, such as during the Tanker War of the 1980s, the oil has continued to flow.', 'There has been some disruption to tanker traffic through the strait. Bahri, Saudi Arabias national shipping company, has temporarily suspended crossings, according to the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times, and other oil groups and tanker operators are also said to have been restricting movements. But so far there have been no signs of any material disruption to oil supplies. As Michael Wirth, chief executive of Chevron, put it in an interview with CNBC: I think weve been in a well-supplied market for some period of time here, and thats generally what the view continues to be.', 'Some of the most significant aftershocks from the killing of Soleimani could play out in Iraq, which has been attempting to remain on good terms with both the US and Iran. US citizens working for foreign oil companies in southern Iraq started leaving the country last Friday, and although there is not expected to be any immediate impact on the countrys oil production, in the longer term the situation could make increasing its output more difficult. Increased tensions and a more distant relationship with the US could hamper the Iraqi oil industrys growth.', 'The evanescence of the oil price rally over the past week has provided further vindication for US exploration and production company executives who had said they did not expect to step up activity in response to the rise in crude.', 'Scott Sheffield, chief executive of Pioneer Natural Resources, told CNBC: The biggest question I am getting at this [Goldman Sachs] conference is: Are you going to add any rigs because youve got another seven, eight dollars a barrel? And my answer is no. Everybodys answer is no. Were going to give it back to the investor.', 'The pressure on US oil producers and service companies was shown this week by a series of statements on job cuts, including an unspecified number at Occidental Petroleum following its acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum last year.', 'nExxonMobils discovery of more than 6 billion barrels of oil equivalent off the coast of Guyana has been the most significant exploration success of the past five years. Just before Christmas, the ExxonMobil-led consortium developing the Starbroek block started production from its first wells there, and is on course for its target of producing 750,000 barrels per day by 2025. Now it looks as though neighbouring Suriname may follow Guyana into an oil boom. On Tuesday Apache of the US and Total of France announced a significant oil discovery off the coast of Suriname, with potential for further finds in the same block. WoodMacs Luiz Hayum and colleagues estimated that the first discovery, named Maka Central, contained 300 million barrels of oil, 150 million barrels of condensate and 1.4 trillion cubic feet of gas. The US Geological Survey in 2012 gave mean estimates for the undiscovered technically recoverable resources of the Guyana-Suriname Basin of 13.6 billion barrels of oil and 21.2 trillion cubic feet of gas.', 'Apaches share price soared on the news, rising 27% on Tuesday, its largest one-day gain in nearly 50 years. Its success was particularly welcome for Apache following disappointment over its Alpine High shale gas play, first unveiled in 2016. Even after their jump this week, Apaches shares are still 27% below their level four years ago.', 'nHouston-based Talos Energy announced this week that a third-party evaluation of its Zama discovery off the coast of Mexico had given a best estimate of its recoverable resources at 670 million barrels of oil equivalent. The field, first discovered in 2017, is the largest exploration success so far for foreign companies since Mexicos oil industry was opened up by the previous president, Enrique Pea Nieto, who left office in 2018.', 'His successor, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, often known as Amlo, has a policy of favouring Pemex, the national oil company, and has been restricting sales of exploration and development rights to foreign companies. Reuters reported in September that Pemex was seeking control over the development of Zama.', 'Pemex last month announced its own 500 million barrel discovery at the onshore Quesqui field, but it will take sustained development to reverse the decline in Mexicos oil production, and Lopez Obradors policies have drawn criticism.', 'Foreign investors in renewable energy in Mexico are also facing new challenges. Lopez Obrador said at his regular daily press conference on Wednesday that the authorities would review wind and solar power contracts to see if they offered unjustified subsidies. He said people had been deceived for a long time into thinking that power subsidies helped consumers, when they actually benefited private companies. His announcement fits into his wider strategy of helping CFE, the state-owned electric utility, while making conditions more difficult for foreign power companies.', 'nThe American Petroleum Institute (API), the influential industry group, launched its annual State of American Energy report, which always gives a good idea of its priorities for the coming year. Timothy Cama of E&E News noted that the API was making an all-out push to paint itself as a climate change champion, including a subtle shift of emphasis from talking about the oil and gas industry to describing itself as natural gas and oil. A new video advert from the API makes the point very clearly, arguing: We have different perspectives on the best way forward. But on issues that matter, like climate change, were more alike than we think.', 'One key issue for the US industry emerged very clearly: its concern about the threatened fracking ban proposed by some Democratic presidential hopefuls including Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Such a ban could cost up to 7.3 million jobs in the US, the API warned.', 'In a sign of the mounting pressure on some API members, the worlds largest fund manager Blackrock this week signalled it would step up efforts to persuade companies to address climate-related risks. It joined the Climate Action 100+ group of investors, which works to ensure the worlds largest corporate greenhouse gas emitters take necessary action on climate change.', 'The decision was well-timed, whether by accident or design. This week, climate activists launched a new campaign called Stop the money pipeline, which will encourage customers to take their money out of financial services companies that support the fossil fuel industry. The campaign, which argues that Wall Street is financing climate destruction, is targeting three institutions in particular: JPMorgan Chase, Liberty Mutual Insurance, and Blackrock.', 'The US gas industrys claim to be helping the climate fight received some support from the preliminary estimates of US greenhouse gas emissions in 2019 produced by the Rhodium Group, a research firm. Rhodium calculated that, after a sharp uptick in 2018, US emissions fell by 2.1% last year, mostly because of a decline in coal-fired power generation. Gas and renewable generation filled the gap as coal declined, cutting nearly 10% from the US power sectors emissions, the largest drop in decades. Outside the power sector, meanwhile, emissions rose.', 'An announcement this week confirmed that President Donald Trump is continuing with his strategy of attempting to ease the burden on business from environmental regulations. In an event at the White House on Thursday, Trump talked about his administrations plans to reform the regulations for implementing the 1969 National Environmental Policy Act. The president said his proposals would slash job-killing regulations and improve the quality of life for all of our citizens, making it quicker and cheaper to secure environmental approvals for infrastructure projects. Environmental groups and Democrats attacked the plans: the Natural Resources Defense Council said the proposals if implemented would cripple the way NEPA is applied to federally approved and funded projects. In particular, the new rules would limit federal agencies ability to take potential impacts on climate change into account in environmental reviews.', 'Among members of Congress, however, there have been further moves aimed at developing a new climate strategy for the US. Democrats on the Energy and Commerce Committee of the House of Representatives published a proposal for legislation intended to cut US greenhouse gas emissions, known as the CLEAN Future Act. It is an ambitious-looking plan, aimed at reaching net zero emissions by 2050, while taking a technology-neutral approach that would allow a variety of different paths to reach that goal.', 'Meanwhile, Mitt Romney, the senator from Utah who was the Republicans presidential nominee in 2012 and has sought to maintain some distance from Trump, tweeted that he had met Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, to discuss potential bipartisan solutions to address climate change. The US Chamber of Commerce, the business lobby group that was a fierce critic of some of the Obama administrations climate policies, urged the president and Congress to find common ground on 35 bipartisan bills that can help address climate change through innovation and investment.', 'Another bill from the Democrats on the House Energy and Commerce this week would offer $6 billion in rebates and grants to support investment in electric vehicle charging infrastructure. An important new report from Rocky Mountain Institute analysed the cost of that infrastructure, and argued that there should be a concerted effort in the US to understand and reduce soft costs such as permitting and regulatory compliance. Charger installation costs in the US are three to five times the cost of the charger itself.', 'Google has signed a huge deal with NV Energy in Nevada to provide 350 megawatts of solar power and up to 280 MW of storage for a new data centre being built outside Las Vegas. Google has been matching its entire annual electricity consumption with renewable energy since 2017.', 'And finally: Meat Loaf, of Bat Out Of Hell fame, this week clashed with teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg, saying she had been brainwashed into thinking that there is climate change and there isnt. Thunberg responded that the real issues were not about Meatloaf or her, but about scientific facts. The spat was widely represented as emblematic of the generational divide over the climate issue, but in fact the differences between age groups are not as great as you might think. A poll for CBS News last year found 70% of Americans aged 18-29 agreeing that climate change was a serious problem, compared to 58% of those aged 65 or older.', 'nSource: Wood Mackenzie']"

    "title": "What Changed Energy Markets In The 2010s?",
    "content": "['The 2010s saw a seismic shift across the energy sector. This week, Wood Mackenzies analysts identify five major themes and trends, from the U.S. energy resurgence to geopolitical tension and an awakening to climate change, which changed the industry forever.', '1. US energy resurgence: Commercial exploitation of US tight oil changed energy markets and upstream strategies. The technology breakthrough may have come the prior decade, but fracking tight oil came of age in the 2010s. Cheap money poured into half a dozen plays, rejuvenating a moribund domestic sector. U.S. international oil companies focused on international business development pivoted back home in search of lower risk growth. U.S. liquids production increased by 10 million barrels per day (b/d) from 2010, mostly in tight oil, reaching a record 18 million b/d by end-2019. The US lifted its crude export ban in 2015.', 'New U.S. volumes added 10% to global oil supply, undermining price and crude price differentials. OPEC ultimately was forced to shift strategy, embracing non-OPEC producers, notably Russia, to cut production and protect price. Some OPEC economies need in excess of US$80/bbl Brent to balance budgets.', 'Shale gas and, latterly, huge volumes of low-cost Permian gas drove the Henry Hub price down. Gas squeezed coal out of the power mix and spawned multiple U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) export projects, which are starting to disrupt the global LNG market. Rising ethane production sparked a renaissance in U.S. petrochemicals.', '2. Intensifying geopolitical tension: Emboldened by the prospect of energy self-sufficiency, the U.S. flexed its muscles across a wide range of foreign policy issues affecting energy markets  especially after the 2016 election. First, in 2014, the U.S. (with the EU) imposed sanctions on Russia following the invasion of Crimea. Second, in 2017, President Trump announced the U.S. exit from the Paris Agreement of 2015, spurning the global climate change deal that needs both multi-lateral co-operation and leadership from the worlds biggest economy to succeed. Third, the U.S. trade dispute with China beginning in 2018 led to slower global economic growth and energy demand. Fourth, that same year, the US pulled out of the Iran nuclear agreement.', 'Global liquids supply outages  a blunt measure of geopolitical tension  rose exponentially from under 1 million b/d in 2010 to over 5 million b/d by 2019, 5% of demand. Some 2 million b/d is directly due to U.S. export sanctions on Iran and Venezuela imposed in the last three years.', '3. The last cost cycle: Upstream costs blew out early in the decade. With oil prices rising but service sector capacity tightening, the industry lost discipline as it strove to develop a clutch of mega-projects. All that changed in 2014. Brent plunged, and the industry had to recalibrate for lower-for-longer prices to survive.', 'Majors turned to downstream for answers  to a refining management experienced in managing for margin after a lengthy down-cycle. The strategy was back-to-basics: cutting costs and tightening capital discipline; releasing capital from non-core assets and concentrating portfolios around advantaged positions; re-engineering future projects to reduce costs; and executing projects faster to bring forward cash generation. Upstream E&P spend today is 40% below the 2014 peak but with spare capacity in the service sector theres more bang for buck. Corporate cash flow breakevens in 2020 should average US$55/bbl (Brent), down from US$95/bbl in 2014. The 2010s may have seen the last global cost squeeze; as we enter the 2020s, the outlook for oil and gas supply is plentiful while the risks to longer term demand from the energy transition are growing.', '4. An awakening to climate change: Zero-carbon technologies entered the mainstream. Power generation from solar and wind shifted from subsidized luxury in developed economies to cost-competitive disruptor as costs plummeted. Renewables, awarded through competitive tender or, increasingly, as merchant operators, now dominate new build capacity in power markets. Electric vehicles, energy storage and other grid-edge technologies are at an earlier stage of commercialisation but signal the coming seismic change. Policy is gathering momentum, the IMO regulation to limit sulphur emissions in shipping just one example.', 'Capital markets started to withdraw finance, reflecting changing public perception  the energy sectors weighting in the S&P500 halved from 2010 and is now just 5% of the index. Corporate strategies began to shift, with leading IOCs leaning towards lower carbon intensity gas production and establishing new energy businesses to invest in zero-carbon assets. Saudi Aramcos IPO in December 2019 indicates changing attitudes among fossil-fuel-dependent economies to the future energy mix.', '5. Unknown unknowns: Planning and expected trends can be shattered in a moment by unexpected events. Two stand out. The Macondo blowout in 2010 was one, with lasting lessons learned about health and safety and operating in a frontier environment. Despite the disaster, deepwater oil and gas production increased by 50% to 10 million b/d in the decade. Fukushima in 2011 was another. The resultant closure of Japans entire nuclear fleet drove up demand (and prices) for coal, gas and oil as utilities resorted to alternative fuels. As well as prompting Japan to review its long-term energy security, the risks exposed by the accident continue to undermine confidence in nuclear, even with its zero-carbon credentials.', 'nSource: Wood Mackenzie']"

    "title": "US shale oil productivity growth expected to slow in some basins",
    "content": "['The dramatic jump in productivity seen in the early days of the US shale oil boom may be waning, but is likely not over, according to analysts, who expect efficiencies, at least for some plays, to edge higher in 2020.', 'While productivity is expected to climb, drilling has slowed, and thus shale production gains are expected to slow. In the Delaware Basin in West Texas, for instance, S&P Global Platts Analytics expects crude output to average 1.5 million b/d in December 2020, up 15% on the year. Thats down from a 16% gain in December 2019, and a 57% gain in December 2018.', 'Wells have become increasingly larger as E&P companies have drilled longer laterals, or horizontal legs, and used more proppant  sand and/or water that keep fractures open and facilitate oil and gas flow to the surface.', 'But in some places, operators are beginning to push up against the limits of how much shale they can deliver without some startling new technology breakthrough, experts say.', 'Some claim productivity has even taken a step backwards, at least in some areas.', 'In some areas, were actually seeing productivity degradation, Sarp Ozkan, director of energy analytics for Enverus, formerly known as DrillingInfo, said.', 'As the industry moved from testing to development mode in the oil patch, the biggest challenge was how to extract the most oil from each well. That was particularly true in the Permian Basin of West Texas/New Mexico where at least a dozen geological subsurface horizons exist, each requiring a unique recipe to maximize oil yields.', 'In 2014, operators were forced to innovate rapidly to combat a sharp drop in oil prices from $100/b to barely half that level by year-end.', 'Since then, the industry experienced a considerable jump of about 50% higher initial well production (IP) rates, especially in the Permian, Ozkan said', 'Previously, companies drilled one or two wells on a unit to satisfy leasing terms, with superior results. At the same time, to boost economics, operators tried to fit the most wells into the least amount of acreage, called downspacing.', 'But returning to a site with just a few wells and later drilling six or a dozen wells much closer together on it may make the new wells a lot less productive, said Ozkan.', 'A FINITE MILKSHAKE', 'nIts like theyre sucking a finite milkshake, he added. When you put more straws in the cup, each straw starts competing for more milk  that is, each well struggles to rake in more oil than the offset wells nearby, he said.', 'That has caused some plays such as the STACK in Oklahoma to show year-over-year productivity degradation. For example, Concho Resources said in October its Permian big Dominator project did not meet earlier expectations because of too-tight spacing between wells.', 'Laredo Petroleum told investors about a year ago it had begun upspacing Permian wells at its Yellow Rose project  placing wells farther apart, not closer together. By August, Yellow Rose had outperformed a tightly-spaced offset well package for cumulative oil per foot by more than 30%, Jason Pigott, then Laredo president and now CEO, said in a quarterly call that month.', 'Not only did results of wider spacing confirm Laredos expectation that 2019 well productivities would show significant increases versus 2018, but also significant productivity improvements versus more tightly spaced offset wells throughout its acreage, Piggot said.', 'As production growth has faded in favor of cash flows, US oil operators dropped rigs throughout the past year. Productivity growth also reduced the need for some rigs.', 'As operators try to squeeze more operational and financial oomph from each dollar spent and study IP rates and decline curves to measure well efficiencies, a simpler metric of production gained per well brought online is also a powerful gauge, S&P Global Platts Analytics analyst Andrew Cooper said.', 'Eagle Ford efficiency has fallen roughly 7% year on year as of the second quarter of 2019, according to Cooper. The Delaware play in Texas was down 5% over the same period, although efficiencies in the Delaware New Mexico play were up 23% using the same metrics, Cooper said.', '[Those figures show] why operators are flocking to the western half of the Permian, Cooper said.', 'PERMIAN, BAKKEN EFFICIENCIES STILL RISING', 'nMoreover, improvements, at least in the Permian and Bakken Shale of North Dakota where efficiencies are still rising, will continue for at least another year.', 'Likely in 2021-2022 we will see efficiencies or production per well stabilize and flatten due to limited core acreage remaining, he said.', 'On the other hand, whats happening with shale productivity often lies in the definition, Anexandre Ramos-Peon, senior analyst for shale at Rystad Energy, said.', 'The classical way to define it is production  in the first two to three months, Ramos-Peon said. But since some operators really cherry pick the way they represent their production. Some release outputs of the first 24 hours or 30 days, so reported numbers are not comparative.', 'Also, some operators deliberately cut back peak output to produce more down the road. And well laterals, or horizontal legs, are getting longer  from about 5,000 or 6,000 feet in 2014, to 9,000 or 10,000 feet currently  and thus reap more oil per well.', 'Ramos-Peon conceded many Eagle Ford wells have not been as good as before. But oil prices are lower too  around $56.44/b in Q3 2019 versus $69.43/b in Q3 2018, so operators might target different areas away from the sweet spots, unwilling to produce their best oil into a lower-priced market.', 'Thus, there is no one number that fits all sorts of metrics, Ramos-Peon said. On the other hand, initial production rates of 90- and 180 days have kept growing every month.', 'In October, Rystad in a report said, after studying months of production data, that the average well each month in the Permian was slightly more productive than its counterpart drilled three to six months before.', 'In the Bakken, Eagle Ford and DJ Basin [in Colorado], well productivity is observed at or close to all-time highs as of 1H 2019, the report said.', 'nSource: ', 'nttttttttttntttttnttttttttt']"

    "content": "['The global oil market is brimming with a smorgasbord of crudes, from the Canadian tar sands extracted with the help of steam and sand, to the lightest US condensates whose color mirrors a glass of fine white wine.', 'Each crude stream possesses its own unique characteristics, and when refined yields varying proportions of different refined products. Understanding crude quality has never been more important, following the dramatic rise in US shale output, which has transformed the composition of the global oil market.', 'To reflect this change, S&P Global Platts created a periodic table of oil cataloguing 120 of the most important grades on international markets. Here are some of the grades that have recently come to the fore in a turbulent year for the petroleum supply chain.', 'Bakken, US: light sweet', 'nLight sweets generally trade at a premium to Platts Dated Brent due to their strong yields of gasoline and distillates. Some condensates are priced at a slight discount to Platts Dated Brent because of their high naphtha content.', 'The US crude oil production boom over the past decade has drawn attention to West Texas and its flagship grade WTI. However, the Bakken-Three Forks formations of North Dakota and Wyoming, often lumped together as Bakken, also produce a significant amount of light sweet crude that makes its way to refineries in the US Midwest and US Gulf Coast, and occasionally into the global market.', 'The field produces almost 1.5 million b/d of Bakken, a light sweet crude that typically has a gravity of between 41-43.7 API and a sulfur content of 0.12%. Its importance in both the domestic and international markets has grown significantly since the startup of the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL) and its southern leg, the Energy Transfer Crude Oil Pipeline (ETCOP) in June 2017.', 'Together, these form a 570,000 b/d system that moves oil from the Williston Basin up near the US border with Canada, all the way down to the Texas Gulf Coast at Beaumont and Nederland. Bakken trades relative to NYMEX WTI from its point of origin down to the pipelines terminus. Along the US Gulf Coast, it averaged around a $4.50/b premium to NYMEX WTI in 2019.', 'Murban (UAE): light sour', 'nLight sour crudes boast a high fuel oil and gasoil content but are also very high in sulfur. They normally trade at a slight premium to the Platts Dubai sour benchmark.', 'Crudes that are both light in terms of gravity and high in sulfur are a rarity, and Murban  produced onshore from the Abu Dhabi emirate of the UAE  is one of the biggest streams of such oil. Due to its burgeoning production and popularity among Asian refiners, Murban is emerging as a key Middle East crude benchmark.', 'Murban crude oil', 'The crude accounts for more than half of UAE production at around 1.6 million b/d on average, and is one of the major streams in the Middle East with a large spot market.', 'The Abu Dhabi National Oil Company and Intercontinental Exchange are set to launch a futures contract for Abu Dhabis flagship Murban grade in the first half of 2020.', 'A surge in arbitrage flows into Asia, as well as rising US crude exports, have raised competition for Middle East producers at a time when Asian refiners are striving to diversify their crude sources.', 'Murban is also a deliverable grade in the Platts benchmark Dubai and Oman crude assessment process. At least 40% of Murban onshore production is freely traded, according to industry sources. The grade is exported from Jebel Dhanna and Fujairah.', 'Bonny Light (Nigeria): medium sweet', 'nMedium sweets are very attractive to both simple and complex refineries due to their high middle distillate yields, and are generally priced at a premium to Platts Dated Brent.', 'Bonny Light is one of the most prized crudes in the world due to its high gasoline content. Produced onshore in Nigerias oil-rich Niger Delta, it is very popular with refiners globally. Production has averaged around 250,000 b/d recently.', 'India, the main driver of oil demand growth, is the largest buyer of this Nigerian grade.However, militants in the Niger Delta have caused disruptions to pipelines, regularly targeting the key infrastructure tied to the crude and export flows.', 'Bonny Light crude loadings have been under force majeure on three separate occasions in the past 12 months due to pipeline leaks caused by attacks by militants.', 'Many Nigerian crudes are either light or medium sweet, yielding generous amount of diesel, jet fuel and gasoline, making them more expensive than sour crudes. Crudes like Bonny Light are now competing with US shale, due to the quality similarities, and this has greatly altered the direction of crude flows globally.', 'Arab Light (Saudi Arabia): medium sour', 'nMedium sour crudes form the staple diet of complex refineries. They generally trade at a discount to Platts Dated Brent but recently prices for some grades have strengthened due to the supply tightness of such crudes globally.', 'Arab Light is the key export grade for Saudi Arabia, the worlds largest exporter of crude. This crude is a mainstay of the main Asian refining hubs of China, India, Japan and South Korea, making it very significant for the world oil market.', 'Despite being a high-sulfur crude, it boasts a medium-gravity API, making it a well-rounded grade for refiners to process. When refined it produces a wide variety of products, especially for those with complex processing units.', 'Arab Light is mainly produced from the giant Ghawar and Khurais fields, but it also contains volumes from other fields. The Saudi grades most affected by attacks on the countrys oil infrastructure in September 2019 were Arab Light and Arab Extra Light.', 'The Abqaiq facility, which was damaged in the attacks, helps process Arab Light and also Arab Extra Light. The Abqaiq plant has the ability to depressurize, desulfurize, and de-gas crude production, making it safe for pipeline transport.', 'Doba (Chad): heavy sweet', 'nHeavy sweets are traditionally priced at a discount to Platts Dated Brent but their popularity has broadened. They became more valuable ahead of the IMO 2020 sulfur cap due to their very low sulfur content.', 'Named after a city in southern Chad where vast amounts of oil was discovered, this crude has emerged as one of the coveted barrels as demand for cleaner fuels grows.', 'Dobas demand used to be limited to complex refiners due to its extremely acidic profile, but its quality has changed over the years due to new fields Badila and Mangara coming on stream. This change in quality has broadened the customer base for Doba. The crudes appeal increased sharply ahead of the IMO 2020 sulfur cap due to its fuel oil-rich but low-sulfur content, which makes it an ideal grade for producing marine gasoil.', 'This crude is finding homes in refineries all over the world and has been particularly popular in the storage hubs of Fujairah and Rotterdam, where the crude is processed at topping facilities to make IMO-compliant fuel oil. The price of Doba has risen dramatically as a result.', 'Crude differentials for this grade reached a record high of Dated Brent plus $1.65/b in late September, according to Platts data. Around four years ago, Doba was trading just below Dated Brent minus $8.00/b.', 'Doba production has also risen over the year with production averaging around 150,000 b/d, compared to levels of around 80,000 b/d six years ago. Oil from landlocked Chad is pumped via the Kome-Kribi (Doba) pipeline to the coast of Cameroon, where it loads at a terminal around 10 km offshore.', 'West Canadian Select (Canada): heavy sour', 'nHeavy sours are popular with complex refineries as they can be tough to refine due to their high sulfur content. They are priced at a significant discount to light crude benchmarks such as Platts Dated Brent or the NYMEX light sweet crude futures contract.', 'As its name implies, Western Canadian Select is a select blend of heavy sour material produced in  you guessed it  Western Canada. There is no true production of WCS. Like the US grade WTI, WCS is a blended barrel, meaning its supply is based upon and controlled by the inputs available plus pipeline space and economics.', 'The primary consumers of this heavy sour crude are US Midwest and US Gulf Coast refiners, which have sufficiently complex plants to process it and enjoy the significantly depressed prices at which WCS trades.', 'Why are WCS values so low? Essentially, the crude is land-locked. There is more crude production in Western Canada than there are avenues to export it, which causes its price to fall to levels where rail cars are used to help clear the glut.', 'A shortage of heavy sour crude  brought on by OPEC+ cuts, declining Mexican output and sanctions on Venezuela and Iran  has increased the global interest for WCS. However, so far, US Midwest and USGC refiners have maintained a consistent appetite for WCS, preventing large-scale exports.', 'nSource: ', 'nttttttttttntttttnttttttttt']"

    "title": "Exploration in 2020  The transition is yet to start",
    "content": "['The Energy Transition and Extinction Rebellion may have led the energy news agenda and stimulated reflection in many E&P boardrooms in 2019, but the impact on exploration drilling is not yet apparent. The global high impact well[1] count in 2019 was 91 wells, up 36% on 2018. Drilling spend was flat at $3.5 billion, however, as average well costs fell. Discovered commercial volume was the highest since 2015 at around 13 billion barrels of oil equivalent (boe) from the 27 high impact discoveries announced so far. The commercial success rate was at a 10-year high of 32%. This level of activity looks likely to be sustained through 2020.', '77% of total estimated 13bn boe discovered was gas, with seven of the top ten discoveries being gas in Russia (2), Iran, Mauritania, Senegal, Indonesia and Cyprus. The two biggest oil discoveries were both in the Stabroek licence in Guyana, which at 6 billion barrels and counting, is one of the most prolific oil licences ever issued.', '2019 was the year that North West Europe topped the charts for high impact drilling globally. This was extraordinary given the maturity of the plays in the UK and Norway. Unfortunately, and some would say predictably, only two high impact discoveries resulted from the 27 well programme  Glengorm in the UK and Liatrnet in Norway. This is a woeful success rate of only 7%. Two wells are still drilling and could yet deliver discoveries, but the low discovery rate should cause pause for thought and the high impact well count should drop in 2020.', 'Guyana topped the oil discovery charts again in 2019 with the Liza field coming onstream in December and another billion barrels added in the Exxon operated Stabroek licence with some more gas also. The five commercial discoveries in 2019 bring the total so far to 14 but it wasnt all plain sailing. The Tullow operated JV made two play opening discoveries that first sounded promising but turned out to be heavy and sour, contributing to a dramatic fall from grace for Tullow with its share price crashing.', 'Already the oil volume discovered and planned for development is far more than the tiny economy of Guyana can handle and the pace may have to slow 2020 if Guyana is to cope. There is still much to learn about both the plumbing of the petroleum system and the robustness of the political system  expect more surprises. The industry will nonetheless continue to try to push the boundaries of the play beyond the Stabroek licence into both shallower and deeper Guyanese waters. The significant Maka Central discovery operated by Apache and announced in January 2020 looks to be the first commercial discovery outside of Stabroek, extending the play into neighbouring Suriname.', 'In Mexico, the 5 high impact exploration wells completed by international oil companies in 2019 failed to deliver a commercial discovery (with one still drilling). In 2020 it should become clearer whether Mexico will deliver the bounty that IOCs hoped for with at least 10 wells operated by seven different IOCs testing over 2.5 billion barrels of unrisked prospective volume in a range of frontier and emerging plays. The geology is complex and mixed results can be expected.', 'Brazil is another country to watch in 2020 with one high impact well currently drilling and seven wells planned for 2020 in recently awarded licences testing 6 billion barrels of unrisked volume in pre-salt plays in the Santos and Campos basins, and the Ceara Basin. Exxon will operate its first two wells since its re-entry and Premier will operate its first well in the Ceara Basin. Its not going to be shooting fish in a barrel in the Santos Basin though with several wells being drilled outside the proven pre-salt play. The much anticipated Peroba well drilled in 2019 by BP, for which a $598 million signature bonus was paid in the 2017 bid round, is understood to have found high CO2 content gas and is considered non-commercial.', 'In Africa, high impact drilling remained subdued at 14 wells completed in 2019 but commercial success rates were high at 57% with over 3 billion boe discovered of which ~80% was gas. There was one frontier play opening gas condensate discovery at Brulpadda in South Africa and there were high impact discoveries in five other countries  Senegal, Mauritania, Nigeria, Angola and Ghana. In 2020, a similar number of high impact wells are expected spread across 10 countries with potentially six frontier play tests in Guinea Bissau, Kenya, Namibia and Gabon. Total is testing a new play concept at a well in Block 48, Congo Basin Angola, notable for being the deepest water exploration well ever at over 3600m.', 'In the emerging gas plays of the Eastern Mediterranean there were six wells drilled and two commercial discoveries delivering 5 tcf. Three of the six wells were drilled by TPAO, two of which were in the Cyprus area and were political rather than technical tests. Five wells testing 16 tcf of gas are planned in 2020 including Totals Byblos-1 well offshore Lebanon.', 'Drilling in Australasia is set to pick up in 2020 after a quiet 2019 with one potentially high impact gas discovery made in the onshore Perth Basin at the West Ereggulla well. In 2020 high impact drilling is mainly about gas with wells planned in Australia, New Zealand, PNG and Timor Leste testing over 10 tcf of gas most of which are testing frontier plays. South East Asia was quiet in 2019 with just three high impact wells and two high impact discoveries in Indonesia and Malaysia discovering 5 tcf of gas.', 'Based on current plans it looks like high impact drilling could be at a similar level in 2020 but with shift of focus to North and South America. Westwood estimates that industry drilling plans are weighted 70/30 oil to gas. Whilst recognising that the industry has had a habit of finding gas when looking for oil it doesnt seem the appetite for finding oil is diminishing. The four most active companies in 2020 are expected to be the European Supermajors Total, Equinor, Shell and ENI, each participating in 14 or more high impact wells. Whilst there has been much talk about the energy transition in 2019, there is little sign of its impact on exploration plans for 2020.', 'nSource: Westwood Energy']"

The S&P 500 finished the afternoon of the 8th up 1%, and the Nasdaq composite closed out the day with a 0.7% gain, an all-time high.', 'Oil markets responded in a similar fashion after Trumps address, with Brent and WTI prices falling back below pre-Sulemani strike levels after reaching peaks of $71.75 and $65.65 respectively. WTI crude prices for February futures lost $3.10 or 5% falling to $59.60 per barrel, while Brent March deliveries dropped $2.89  nearly 4.2%  to $65.44. Parallel price spikes and dips can be seen after the death of Suleimani.', 'Market Resilience', 'With Rumors of WWIII swirling in the media and threats to the strategic Strait of Hormuz more serious than ever before, what explains the oil markets uncharacteristic calm? A few contributing factors:', 'The global oil market is currently well supplied, thanks largely to record-breaking production of US shale reserves. Supply is so sufficient, in fact, that OPEC has committed to multi-year production cuts as a measure to mitigate over-supply risks. We could also expect President Trump to lean on OPEC allies  especially swing producer Saudi Arabi  to increase production should a significant oil disruption take place. Furthermore, higher prices send signals to nimble marginal producers like US shale operators to increase production. More oil in circulation means more insulation against sudden output shortages.', ' Those who bet on sustained oil price increases in the wake of geopolitical crises lost out in 2019. From attacks on oil tankers in the gulf this past summer to Irans brazen missile strike against critical Saudi oil infrastructure in Abqaiq and Khurais, oil price spikes were short-lived. In the latter incident  wherein Iranian drone and missile strikes temporarily took out 5 million barrels per day of global supply (5%)  oil prices returned to pre-strike levels in just 2 weeks. By contrast, not one drop of oil has been disrupted in the current US-Iran tit-for-tat. If the Abqaiq attacks didnt result in a prolonged oil price increase, what sort of event could?', ' Well have calm in the short term. Irans Suleimani revenge attack against Iraqi bases housing US personnel resulted in no American casualties and minimal infrastructure damage. There are reports that the Iran informed Iraq of the missile attack some 6 hours prior, with a further leak to the U.S., giving time for troops to evacuate. In the strange world of escalation and deterrence, this is was an olive branch attack, which Trump appears to have accepted  responding only with sanctions and strong words rather than a military option. Trump does not seem interested in a war.', 'Looking Ahead', 'For the moment, market jitters from the US-Iran standoff have been short-lived. Iran seems to have achieved the right balance in its response, simultaneously responding forcefully to the death of Maj. Gen. Suleimani without provoking a massive US military retaliation. But it would be naive to consider Irans reprisal as fully-over.', 'Tehran is known for its low-intensity and long-term strategic thinking, as it cannot hope to stand toe-to-toe military against the United States and her allies. We can expect Iran to continue its response over the coming weeks, months and years in its trademark asymmetric fashion. Its actions may look familiar, including missile strikes and tanker hijackings, but could also include more disruptive tactics including cyber warfare and proxy attacks through terrorist groups such as Hezbollah against U.S. allies across the Middle East.', 'This is explains why the Saudis have temporarily suspended operations of their largest government owned shipping company  Bahri  through the Strait of Hormuz. They are rightfully concerned that Tehrans retaliatory actions are just beginning.', 'In the event of a supply disruption, there are some 2 million barrels per day of spare capacity that could potentially come online from the worlds troubled oil producing regions like Venezuela, Libya, and Russia. All of them are under sanctions or amidst a major civil conflict. Increased prices caused by a supply shortage could provide the financial incentive for additional production to be brought online.', 'While markets remain subdued at present, any Iranian action that evokes a major military response from the United states  be it a closure of the Strait of Hormuz (where 20% of oil supplies transit daily) or the harming of US assets  could push crude prices above $70 and beyond. Global markets have to some extent become hardened to geopolitical crises. But we have just entered a new and unknown phase of the US-Iran confrontation that started in 1979, and no eventuality can be ruled out.', 'nSource: Forbes']"

Tehran intentionally avoided targeting areas with Americans, CNN reported, quoting several Trump administration officials. The resolution adopted by the Iraqi parliament asking all foreign forces to leave the country provided some consolation to Iran. This may have helped Tehran to take only a symbolic action against Washington in the ongoing war of nerves.', 'The message was clear on the US too. President Donald Trumps speech after the missile attacks signalled easing of tensions. It increasingly became obvious that both Tehran and Washington wanted to scale down the temperature. Hence, rather than signaling a military response to the Iranian missile attacks, Trump vowed to impose new sanctions on Iran.', 'Crude markets took the cue, tumbling 4 per cent, in a go. In a dramatic pullback from the high of $65.65 late Tuesday, after Iran lobbed missiles on US military bases in Iraq, crude dipped. Oil headed for its first weekly loss since November last year.', 'Oil futures too fell sharply on Wednesday, logging lowest settlement since mid-December.', 'In the meantime, the US House of Representatives also voted on Thursday to limit President Trumps authority to strike Iran. America received indications that the Islamic Republic has asked pro-Iran militias in the Middle East not to carry out attacks against US interests, Vice President Mike Pence said in comments to Fox.', 'The prospects of a supply disruption from the Middle East were clearly receding.', 'Data from the US Energy Information Administration also helped the crude markets ease further. During the week ending January 3, US crude supplies went up by 1.2 million barrels.', 'However, until then, crude markets remained in flux, reacting to virtually every move. Confusion was ruling. Prospects of war had already pushed oil prices to a seven-month high. The tone and tenor of Washington were enough to keep the crude markets rattled. The US was throwing around wild threats, and not just towards Iran, but also Iraq, after its Parliament passed the resolution urging the United States to leave the country.', 'In a sharp reaction to the resolution, Trump vowed to hit Iraq with penalties like theyve never seen before, if American troops were forced out on an unfriendly basis. Itll make Iranian sanctions look somewhat tame, the president told reporters aboard Air Force One.', 'Interestingly, in a chaotic afternoon in Washington last Monday, the US denied it was pulling its forces out of Iraq after a leaked letter to the effect, apparently from the top US general in Baghdad to his Iraqi counterpart, emerged. This added to the confusion. Washington denied. Theres been no decision whatsoever to leave Iraq, Mark Esper, the US defence secretary said later.', 'Although how the Iraqi parliament resolution could be implemented remains a mystery. Yet, one thing was certain: For Washington to isolate Iraq could have caused further upheaval in the crude markets.', 'Iraq is the second-largest oil producer within the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec), behind only Saudi Arabia. It produced 4.6 million barrels of crude per day in November. In the prevailing scenario, markets were in no position to overlook these numbers.', 'Sidelining Iraqs output could have exacerbated fears of a supply shock that was already in play after General Soleimani was assassinated. Prices could have spiked, analysts underlined. If there were Iran-style sanctions that made Iraqs oil toxic to the rest of the world, that could have driven prices up quite sharply, Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group was quoted as saying.', 'In an election year, Washington couldnt have afforded higher prices at gas stations. President Trump is clearly bound by the election dynamics to ensure the markets are supported and the economy does not suffer an oil shock, Matt Gertken, a geopolitical strategist at BCA Research was quoted as saying.', 'Tom Kloza of the Oil Price Information Service doubted the president will tolerate $70-plus crude or $3-plus gasoline in red states. By the end of the year, Kloza estimated WTI crude and Brent to be in the mid-$50s a barrel range  a 10pc to 20pc drop from current levels. And, that should translate into cheaper fuel at the pumps.', 'Deescalating the situation and cooling down the war theatre was a better bet for President Trump and he went for it. Crude markets had short legs to carry on the bull run and they retreated at the first possibility.', 'nSource: DAWN']"

The supply chain will welcome the boost but not all projects will go ahead. Many have slipped from 2019, or earlier. Financing options will tighten. Projects will not only be scrutinised on economic terms, but on their environmental impact.', 'Most new projects are short-cycle, high-return tie-backs, which will help them over the line.

This was demonstrated at the IEAs 2019 Ministerial Meeting, which mandated the Agency to start consultations with India for a strategic partnership that could serve as a path to eventual membership, a game-changer for international energy governance.', 'The IEA report congratulates the Indian government on its outstanding achievements in extending citizens access to electricity, affordable efficient lighting and clean cooking in record time through historic schemes like SAUBHAGYA, UJALA and UJJWALA, while pursuing energy market reforms and the swift deployment of renewable technologies. The report highlights the strong growth of renewables in India, which now account for almost 23% of the countrys total installed capacity. The review also found that energy efficiency improvements in India avoided 15% of additional energy demand, oil and gas imports, and air pollution as well as 300 million tonnes of CO2 emissions between 2000 and 2018.', 'India is becoming increasingly influential in global energy trends. The countrys demand for energy is set to double by 2040, and its electricity demand may triple, according to the IEA report. Indian oil consumption is expected to grow faster than that of any other major economy. This makes further improving energy security a key priority for Indias economy, the report says.', 'The IEA welcomes Indian government policies designed to conduct large-scale renewable energy auctions, open up coal mining to private companies, and promote access to oil and gas markets for foreign investors. The report offers a wide range of recommendations for reforms in support of Indias goal of promoting open and well-functioning energy markets in sectors such as coal, gas and electricity. These include building strong regulators to ensure non-discriminatory access, moving from state allocation to market pricing, and further rationalising energy subsidies.', 'In Indias renewables-rich states, the share of variable renewables in electricity generation is already above 15%, a level that calls for dedicated policies to ensure they integrate smoothly into the power system. NITI Aayog can play a strong role in working with the states to implement power sector reforms, advance grid integration, improve flexibility and coordinate energy policy decisions.', 'The review also strongly encourages India to institutionalise energy policy coordination across government with a national energy policy framework.', 'NITI Aayog Vice Chairman Dr Kumar emphasised that Indias energy goals cannot be achieved without strong coordination of policies and targets between central and state governments, notably on electricity market design and renewable targets, and that a stronger cooperation is therefore needed on these fronts.', 'Coal Minister Joshi said: With the support of Amitabh Kant and Dr. Rajiv Kumar, India recently launched commercial mining operations. IEAs report will be very helpful for designing our future course of action in the energy sector.', 'Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Pradhan said: NITI Aayog is already preparing a National Energy Strategy, and I would like to propose an annual event where NITI Aayog and the IEA bring together global energy stakeholders to have structured energy dialogue. We look forward to engaging with the IEA on oil security and on helping India move towards a natural gas-based economy.', 'Power and Renewable Energy Minister Singh congratulated the IEA and NITI Aayog for the launch of the report: Indias energy policy is a global story. India has the largest unified power grid that operates in single frequency. India has moved from scarcity to surplus electricity over the past few years while implementing the largest and the fastest energy access and energy efficiency programmes in the world.', 'The report will help India to design implementation strategies to achieve secure and sustainable energy access for its citizens.', 'n', 'n', 'Source: IEA']"

While the oil ministry said production and exports havent been affected, challenges remain for the longer term because of a need for Western expertise and financing for some of the more difficult projects.', 'Iraqs oil industry has had issues on several fronts, from sourcing water for maintaining reservoir pressure to the growing cost of integrating gas and power operations at fields, analysts said.

BP and Shell, both of which have operations in the southern region of Basrah, declined to comment. ExxonMobil, which operates the West Qurna 1 field, is evacuating its remaining 17 expats still there, leaving the field with Iraqi staff only, sources said. The field has about 400,000 b/d of output. Houston-based Halliburton, which provides oil services from its office in Basrah, didnt reply to an email seeking comment.', 'Iraqs crude production is steady at 4.46 million b/d, exports are averaging 3.45 million b/d and both were not affected by recent events in Iraq, an oil ministry spokesman said Thursday.

The biggest fields (Rumaila, West Qurna 1, Zubair) were in production before IOCs became the operators 10 years ago and thousands of Iraqi oil workers continued to be employed in those fields.', 'Chinese workers, who also work on fields including CNPCs equity stake in the giant southern field of Rumaila, could also become a target if the security situation deteriorates.', 'The Chinese should not be specifically targeted unless there is a more general breakdown of security or attempt to drive out foreign oil companies, said Robin Mills, CEO of Qamar Energy. One question might be the impact on BP /CNPCs Rumaila.', 'For now, Iraq may be safe. OPEC and 10 allies this month started a 1.7 million b/d production cut accord that runs through March. Iraq pumped 4.58 million b/d of crude in December, a nine-month low, according to the latest Platts survey of OPEC production. Its quota under the current deal is 4.46 million b/d.', 'At the moment some oil production is shut in as part of the OPEC agreement so Iraq has flexibility to ramp-up various fields to offset any declines, said Ian Thom, research director, Middle East Upstream at Wood Mackenzie.

But stiff US sanctions that deprive Tehran of crucial revenue will crimp the regimes ability to finance destabilizing activities against its neighboring countries, ultimately boosting energy security, said Francis Fannon, assistant secretary in the US State Departments Bureau of Energy Resources.', 'Our objective was to deprive them of this revenue. In so doing, weve taken more than 2 million b/d off the market, Fannon said Sunday in an interview. Weve deprived the regime of tens of billions of dollars that would have otherwise gone to fund proxy wars, terrorism and instability.', 'Platts spoke to Fannon on the sidelines of the Atlantic Council Global Energy Forum in Abu Dhabi, where he also discussed Iraqs reliance on Iranian gas and electricity, the state of Irans oil exports, and US energy abundance.', 'This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity.', 'S&P GLOBAL PLATTS: In your conversations with officials around the region, how much concern remains about threats from Iran to energy security and infrastructure?', 'FANNON: I dont think its necessarily elevated. What has been increasingly recognized is the market having a greater degree of confidence in the US producer to respond to instability and volatility in the oil markets. The rest of the world is starting to catch up to the US success story. Now, I was here around the same time last year in Abu Dhabi, and I was here then, as Im here now, firstly to underscore the US commitment to political stability in the region and to work in partnership with our allies. Second is to speak about and encourage greater confidence in resilient, transparent energy markets. In short, we have security of those markets, not just the potential but the meaningful production from the US and the responsiveness of the US producer.', 'PLATTS: President Donald Trump has indicated, after some confusion about the continued presence of US troops in Iraq, that he will not be withdrawing them. How vital is the presence of US troops to that energy security and political stability that you talked about?', 'FANNON: The Iraq issue, I would invite people to look closely to what that vote was and what it represented and how one should interpret out of that. The US commitment to Iraq and political stability is enduring. Iraqs oil and gas industry is really an opportunity to support a free and sovereign Iraq. Thats what weve been calling for, for many years. Iraq has great potential. We want to help them realize that.', 'PLATTS: Iraq is reliant on gas and electricity supplies from Iran, and youve been in dialogue with Iraq to try and get them to reduce that reliance on Iranian energy. How close is Iraq to getting off those supplies and what can the US do to help that?', 'FANNON: Our sanctions are prescriptive, and so you mentioned Iran continues to export energy to Iraq. In order for that to continue, the US has issued a waiver from those sanctions on a 90-day rolling basis. In order to achieve that waiver, Iraq must demonstrate credible steps that it is taking to reduce its dependency on Iran. I cant go into details on that, but thats the process that we will pursue, and I suspect we will have a robust dialogue and carefully review that decision.', 'PLATTS: President Trump has suggested hes also considering sanctions on Iraq if US troops are ordered to be withdrawn. Can you talk about what is being considered if this comes to pass?', 'FANNON: I cant really speak to that, Id have to direct you to the White House.', 'PLATTS: You mentioned that US sanctions have taken more than 2 million b/d of Iranian oil exports off the market. How much Iranian oil is still leaking onto the market?', 'FANNON: I cant speculate. The Iranian regime is a criminal enterprise, and criminals operate based on avoiding the law. So I cant speculate on what those numbers would be. I would point out, when I was here a year ago, the US had provided eight countries with [Iran sanctions waivers], and oil prices were about $62 to $63/b for Brent at that time. Today its $64/b. basically no change. We went from eight [waivers] to zero. Thats the story that should be told and underscored. And why is that? It goes back in large measure to the partnership we have with other producing countries, as well as recognition of the US producer to respond to market conditions.', 'PLATTS: Based on tanker tracking and what we hear from the market, China remains a significant buyer of Iranian oil. Has this been addressed with the Chinese, perhaps as part of trade deal negotiations?', 'FANNON: We have frequent communications with a variety of stakeholders both companies and countries, including China. Thats as a matter of course. For particular discussions, I cant go into that. Those are confidential diplomatic communications.', 'PLATTS: Is there an oil price that the Trump administration would like to see? Are you comfortable with current oil prices?', 'FANNON: One of the virtues of our system is that the US government doesnt have any say in oil prices. We dont have any national oil companies, we dont coordinate volumes of production. What we do is we have thousands of different companies engaged in the oil patch and making independent investment decisions, and they do that because it makes good business sense for them. So what the oil price will be, its not for us to say. What we do focus on, though, and spend a considerable amount of time on, is to ensure there is a transparent, liquid and free market, and under those conditions, the US producer can respond appropriately. The US energy abundance story is still being told or very much in the first stages, and it certainly has been a considerable contribution to the US economy.', 'nSource: ', 'nttttttttttntttttnttttttttt']"

    "title": "Suriname Oil Discovery Brings Welcome Good News To Apache Corp.",
    "content": "['The last several years have been a difficult time for Apache Corporation. The company has seen its stock price plummet  like many of its peer companies  as the U.S. industrys success in creating a new abundance of both oil and natural gas has led to chronic low commodity prices. That in turn has resulted in a vicious cycle of diminishing returns to investors and, consequently, diminishing access to new capital as banks and other third-party funders turn their focus to higher-return endeavors.', 'Apaches specific situation has been exacerbated by the reality that its discovery of a major new resource in the Delaware Basin of Texas, the Alpine High, has been unfairly characterized in much of the energy media as just a natural gas play, even though, as I detailed in a January, 2019 piece, it is quite rich in multiple grades of liquids. That focus on the Alpine High has also led to the media and investment community giving short shrift to the companys overall portfolio in the Delaware/Permian Basin, and its diverse and balanced global portfolio that CEO John Christmann recently said affords the flexibility to allocate capital across all three hydrocarbon streams and among conventional and unconventional assets as warranted by market conditions.', 'Apaches common stock traded above $65 as recently as November, 2016, but had fallen all the way to below $21 in early December of last year. While other companies in Apaches peer group have also seen their stock prices decline in recent years, Apaches dropoff was more severe than most, causing rumors to swirl about the company possibly becoming a takeover target in 2020.', 'It was amid all of this confluence of factors that news broke on January 7 that the company, in a 50/50 partnership with French multi-national Total, had made a major new oil discovery offshore Suriname, a tiny nation on the north central coast of South America. Apache Corp.s stock price jumped by 27% in the wake of the announcement on Tuesday, and rose again by $.22 per share on Wednesday amid a general selloff in oil stocks that resulted from the deescalation of the conflict between the U.S. and Iran.', 'The discovery well Maka Central-1 was drilled on Block 58 using the drillship Noble Sam Croft. According to Christmann, Block 58 comprises 1.4 million acres and offers significant potential beyond the discovery at Maka Central. We have identified at least seven distinct play types and more than 50 prospects within the thermally mature play fairway. Christmann went on to add that the partners preliminary formation evaluation data indicates the potential for prolific oil wells. Additionally, the size of the stratigraphic feature, as defined by 3-D seismic imaging, suggests a substantial resource.', 'So, the company thinks this discovery could work into a very large resource, and investment analysts have initially agreed. RBC Capital Markets said that This appears to be a significant discovery and should be viewed very positively, while Bank of America was quoted by Bloomberg as characterizing the discovery as a potential game changer for the investment case. This is the sort of positive market reaction that makes any corporate executive smile.', 'Interestingly, Suriname borders the similarly small nation of Guyana, where ExxonMobil, in partnership with Hess and CNOOC, has made several major new oil discoveries in the past two years on its Stabroek offshore block. As Ive detailed in a series of pieces over the past year, the billions in proceeds from the Stabroek development will likely have a transformative impact for the economy of that nation of barely 800,000 people.', 'It is obviously far too early to know whether this new discovery by Apache and Total might eventually provide a similar positive financial impact for Suriname, a country with just 584,000 citizens and very little current petroleum production. But certainly, the initial indicators are encouraging.', 'What we do know, however, is that this weeks announcement has already had an initial transformative impact on the trajectory of Apache Corp.s stock price, and not a moment too soon. When Christmann and his leadership team made the decision several years ago to shift the companys strategy from an acquire and exploit effort to a focus on exploration, both domestically and internationally, the market analyst community was by and large skeptical.', 'With this weeks developments, that level of skepticism has dropped dramatically.', 'nSource: Forbes']"

Meanwhile, the share of fossil fuels will drop from 47 percent in 2019 to 44 percent this year.', 'Because energy needs [in Japan, South Korea and China] are largely fulfilled by LNG  and some renewables these days, I believe that the net impact to energy costs should be mitigated somewhat, Lorraine Tan, Morningstars Asia regional director of equity research, told Al Jazeera.', 'But a major conflagration in the Middle East that chokes off shipments of oil and gas through the Strait of Hormuz could send energy prices much, much higher than even the recent spikes have reached.', 'If that happens, Asias economies could end up in truly uncharted waters.', 'nSource: Al Jazeera']"

The move was part of the Trump administrations more than year-long pressure campaign to stem a key source of the countrys revenue and bring its oil exports down to zero.', 'In the months since, Iran has offloaded millions of barrels of oil to offshore storage tanks in ports of countries including China, outlets including the New York Times and Bloomberg have reported. This has created a build-up of supply that, if unlocked after a de-escalation between the U.S. and Iran, could drive crude prices down.', 'This is a major bearish overhang on the markets, Paul Sheldon, chief geopolitical adviser for S&P Global Platts, said during Yahoo Finances On the Move.', 'To be sure, a near-term de-escalation of U.S.-Iran tensions remains unlikely as Tehran mulls retaliation over a U.S. airstrike that last week took out one of its top military commanders. Concerns that Irans reprisal could hit the Middle Easts oil infrastructure have put energy traders on edge, sending Brent crude prices (BZ=F) briefly above $70 per barrel Monday for the first time since September.', 'But an eventual deal between the U.S. and Iran may not be completely off the table in the future, with pundits speculating both sides will ultimately attempt to avoid a full-fledged military confrontation.', 'And as Sheldon points out, a deal between the U.S. and Iran would likely usher in the return to market of more than a million barrels per day worth of Iranian crude exports taken offline via sanctions.', 'U.S. sanctions on Iran have more than halved Irans oil production since 2018, Sheldon estimates, with exports having decreased from around 2 million barrels per day to between 400,000 to 500,000.', 'In the short-term, that means any impact on Irans oil supplies as U.S.-Iran tensions continue to simmer wont generate as prominent an effect on energy markets as it would have in absence of the sanctions, Sheldon said.', 'But in the longer-term, this creates an opportunity for payback. Namely, in the event that a U.S.-Iran deal were to occur, the sanctions-related curb on Irans crude production could reverse, adding even more supply to an oil market already facing a mounting glut.', 'We think itd probably take about a year for them to get almost all the 2 million barrels a day back of production, Sheldon said. So if that happens, weve been looking at 2021, 2022, possibly, after the U.S. election, either because a Democrat wins or because Iran realizes they need to come to the table in the event of a Trump re-election.

    "title": "How Russian Oil Has The Most To Gain From Iran-U.S. Crisis",
    "content": "['Probably one of the most far-reaching effects of an escalation of the U.S.-Iran conflict could be a shutdown of oil tanker traffic via the Strait of Hormuz by Iran. Though unlikelygiven the severity of the consequencessuch a move would push international oil markets into considerable turmoil, since approximately 21 percent of globally consumed petroleum passes through the strait. Russia could become a crucial market stabilizer deriving significant financial, strategic, and diplomatic benefits.', 'Even with a release of IEA strategic stocks, higher crude prices resulting from a shutdown of the Strait of Hormuz would likely affect everyone in a similar fashion. If protracted, the crisis and high oil prices would have a dumping effect on global energy consumption and could result in a global economic slowdown. However, at least in the short term, oil producers could benefit from high prices. Russia, in particular.', 'One of the reasons why OPEC has had such a great influence on the worlds crude market is its ability to increase (or decrease) production at any given time to dampen potential swings in oil prices. This ability hinges mostly on OPECs most powerful member (and not only in terms of crude supply or spare capacity)Saudi Arabia, which disposes of OPECs bulk (and the worlds largest) crude spare capacity, approximately 1.5-2 million barrels per day. With a blockade or severe limitation in traffic in the Strait of Hormuz, Saudi Arabias ability to release its spare capacity to the market would be greatly impeded, if not disabled altogether.', 'In the meantime, Iran (!) and Venezuela, the runners up when it comes to global spare capacity, are unable to step in due to external (sanctions) and domestic issues. Also, U.S. shale producers who would at least in the beginning benefit from high crude prices could not be helpful in the same way Saudi Arabia could. Shale production can respond quickly to changing market conditionsmuch quicker than conventional crude productionbut not as quick as a guarantee of almost an immediate release of additional volumes.', 'And since U.S. crude production is in the hands of private companies, it is dictated by the market. Hence, it cannot be stopped at a certain price level but will flow until the market saturates. There is also the aspect of U.S. crude quality that differs substantially from Saudi crude. U.S. shale is lower in density (lighter) and sweeter (includes less sulfur) and, as such, cannot immediately act as a substitute.', 'One country that could potentially have it all is Russia.', 'Not only does Russia produce the right quality of crude (a substitute for the crude potentially locked in by the Strait of Hormuz), but according to a Russian government statement, it holds spare capacity of 500,000 barrels per day. The country cut its oil production due to an agreement with OPEC to prevent oil prices from falling too low in a high-supply environment. With oil prices rising and OPEC generally unable to provide relief, Russia and its oil companies (generally not happy with the production cuts) would surely jump at the opportunity to make the extra buck.', 'Already after the attack on the Saudi Arabian oil facilities late last year, Russia signaled it would be able to provide additional supplies thanks to new investment its companies have made into new spare capacity. Saudi Arabia was able to regain its import volumes quickly and Russia could not prove this new advantage. If an external factor like the closure of the Strait of Hormuz were to block Saudi oil, Russia would have a real chance to put this new spare capacity to test.', 'Russias leverage in the global oil market has increased in the recent years. The country has become an important partner to OPEC in its struggle to remain the deciding entity to influence oil prices after the U.S. shale revolution unfolded. If OPECs crude exports were significantly impaired by Iran-US conflict, Russia would stand to profit handsomely in terms of both actual revenues and in terms of geopolitical influence. Higher prices and production would not only benefit Russian companies but also the Russian budget, given the heavy taxation of the oil industry, especially exports. This aspect is particularly attractive to Russia, as globally crude is traded in U.S. dollars, currency that the country is thirsty for after the U.S.-imposed sanctions on Russian financial institutions following Russias invasion of Ukraine and interference in U.S. elections.', 'Russia also stands to gain geopolitical influence.', 'Lower diversification of crude supply that a blockade of the Strait of Hormuz would imply, would buttress the perception of Russia as a stable producer and exporter. But while Saudi Arabia has shied away from using its supply beyond regulating market and oil price swingsat least after the 1970s oil crisisRussia has been less reserved in this matter. After all research shows Russia has repeatedly used its strong bargaining position as oil and gas supplier to extract geopolitical benefits in Central and Eastern Europe.', 'A blockade of the Strait of Hormuz could potentially strengthen Russias position vis-a-vis energy-hungry Asia since about three-fourths of the crude that passes through the Strait lands there. And this is on top of the increasing importance of Russian natural gas that flows to the Chinese market via the newly opened Power of Siberia pipeline. The plot thickens even more when one considers military exercises Russia, China, and Iran have just concluded in the Gulf of Oman.', 'The law of unintended consequences is hard at work when one considers any type of escalation in the conflict between the U.S. and Iran. And while the Strait of Hormuz has not been blocked yet and may not be blocked any time soon, the option cannot be completely ruled out. Thus, it is important to think through the potential effects that a blockade could have not only on pricing or availability of crude but also on the geopolitical power transfer to a player like Russiawhich is already seen as strategic and diplomatic beneficiary of the U.S.-Iran conflict as well as the forced departure of U.S. forces from Iraq.', 'nSource: Baker Institute']"

Even with the French refinery blockades, Strait of Hormuz tensions and the introduction of stronger OPEC production cuts, the main feeling in the market is one of oversupply.', 'This may also be a by-product of the sheer volume of political news in recent years, with the signal to noise ratio so weak among so many political and economic flashpoints that players have become more reticent about scrambling to respond to each incident.', 'Even drone attacks on Saudi Aramco infrastructure, the first missile attacks on the Kingdom since the Gulf War, sent brief ripples through crude markets before prices dropped back.', 'The weakness of the economy since mid-2018 and the growth of the US as a petro state has also insulated the duration of market shocks. The US-Iran conflict is extremely volatile and a move by either side that substantially disrupts the market could still serve to send oil prices soaring, but at present the market tendency is to remain below $70/bbl.', 'The oil price is not the only aspect of the crisis that petrochemicals players should be monitoring, as logistics is arguably the most pressing factor. Iran has threatened to block the Strait of Hormuz, which sees over half of global linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) exports pass by its banks.', 'The strait is vital for passage of a huge proportion of global chemicals trade as a gateway between the west and the east, and any long-term closure of the route in the event of all-out conflict in the Middle East could be disastrous for players and end markets across the world.', 'The question remains whether Iran would be able to close off the strait in the long-term if it decided to attempt that.', 'Iran could close the Strait but the US can force it open, said a source with knowledge of the geopolitical conditions in the region. The biggest threat to the Gulf in terms of the strait is if Iran mines it [or] they probably deploy their four submarines, but they wouldnt last very long in the face of an American naval operation. The US would not tolerate closure. In the short-term youd get some disruption but not in the longer-term.', 'IRAQ INSTABILITY', 'nThere are also implications on a longer timeframe if substantial quantities of oil are removed from the market, which would have a significant effect on petrochemicals production costs and margins.', 'Iraq, nominally an ally to both sides of the conflict and a key OPEC power, is finding its political footing, already unstable, to be increasingly precarious as the conflict escalates. Soleiman was killed on Iraqi soil, and the Iranian retaliatory strikes were focussed on US military bases in the country.', 'The country is also facing the threat of sanctions from the US after the Iraqi parliament voted unanimously to expel US troops stationed there.', 'The deposal of former ruler Saddam Hussein has led to a steady increase in Iranian influence in the country, according to the UKs House of Commons, as the shift from a Sunni to Shiite-led administration resulted in greater philosophical alignment with Iran, which it has sought to cultivate.', 'The overthrow of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is widely seen as a strategic gift to Iran, said Ben Smith of UK state research organisation the House of Commons Library. From a hostile, Sunni-led state, Iraq was converted into a Shiite-led country with natural affinities with Iran.', 'Since 2003, Irans influence in Iraq has steadily grown, particularly as western countries, especially the US, had reduced their presence, he added.', 'Aside from fears of becoming the battleground for a proxy war between the US and Iran, Iraqs political landscape is extremely unstable after the formal resignation of Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi in December last year, and described by an analyst cited by UK state researchers as a slowly failing state.', 'Iraq was the second-largest OPEC crude producer by output in November, pumping out an average of 4.64m bbl/day during the month, and if external political tensions exacerbate instability in the country, the market could see a substantial player hamstrung at a time when oil prices are already rising.', 'Soleimani was understood to be involved in attempting to broker the formation of a new government, so his death could also have implications for those negotiations.', 'BYSTANDER EFFECT', 'nEconomists at think tank TS Lombard also point to the potential of bystander effect, where allies of either party could be caught in the crossfire, just as the countries worst-hit by the US-China trade war were Germany and emerging market economies.', 'With Iran likely to make life more difficult for US forces in Iraq and eastern Syria, its ties to Russia may mean that the eastern European giant may face additional sanctions as a result of that closeness, according to Christopher Granville, chief political economist at the firm.', 'One of the more obvious political side-effects [of increased military or political aggression in Syria] would be to lower the bar to a renewed escalation in sanctions against Russia, he said. This conclusion about heightened sanctions risk does not depend on any assumptions about specific Russian action or inaction in response to the Soleimani crisis.', 'For both the Congress and the Trump administration it could well be enough that Iran is causing further US military casualties, and that Russia is aligned with Iran in the theatres concerned, he added.', 'With the situation as febrile as it is, the situation could develop incredibly quickly in any direction. But with Iran keen to avoid a full-blown military conflict with a vastly more powerful rival, fallout could appear in the form of attacks on the strait, interference with allied powers, and intensified economic sanctions from the US.', 'Market players will need to stay abreast of developments and roll with the punches.', 'nSource: ICIS by Tom Brown (', ')']"

Last year recorded 26 discoveries of more than 100 million boe, with offshore regions dominating the list of new oil and gas deposits.', 'Guyanas success story from 2018 continued in 2019, with ExxonMobil adding four new discoveries within its offshore Stabroek block, while Tullow Oils Jethro and Joe exploration wells established the presence of a working petroleum system to the west of the Stabroek block. Rystad Energy estimates that the discoveries in Guyana hold cumulative recoverable resources of around 1.8 billion boe.', 'ExxonMobil can be declared explorer of the year for a second year in a row thanks to its ongoing efforts and results in Guyana, along with significant investments in Cyprus. The supermajor was exceptional, both in terms of discovered volumes and value creation from exploration, says Palzor Shenga, a senior analyst on Rystad Energys upstream team.', 'The US company discovered around 1.07 billion boe in additional net resources last year. Rystad Energy estimates the value creation from these volumes to be around $2.7 billion, largely driven by the continued success in Guyana.', 'Off the coast of Mauritania, BPs Orca gas field was not only the largest single discovery, but also the deepest-water find of 2019, estimated by Rystad Energy to hold about 1.3 billion boe of recoverable resources. Recent gas discoveries in the region now support plans to build an additional LNG hub in the Bir Allah area in Mauritania.', 'In Russia, Gazprom announced two discoveries in the Kara Sea, Dinkov in the Rusanovsky block and Nyarmeyskoye in the Nyarmeysky block. Rystad Energy estimates Gazproms 2019 discoveries to hold combined recoverable resources of around 1.5 billion boe, with Dinkov ranked as the second-largest find in 2019 world-wide.', 'Other key offshore discoveries in 2019 include Totals Brulpadda in South Africa, ExxonMobils Glaucus in Cyprus, CNOOCs Glengorm in the United Kingdom and Equinors Sputnik in the Norwegian sector of the Barents Sea.', 'Even so, many of 2019s high-impact wells turned out to be duds, Shenga noted. Although the discovered volumes for 2019 surpassed the preceding year, it was a disappointing year for high-profile wells as many prospects with significant estimated pre-drill resources failed to deliver. Over 10 billion barrels of estimated pre-drill volumes were at stake in wells that failed to encounter hydrocarbons.', 'US independent Hess and Chinese state player CNOOC occupy the second and the third spots on the list of top explorers of 2019 in terms of value creation from new discoveries, with both benefiting from their partnership with ExxonMobil in Guyanas Stabroek block. Hess added about $2 billion in value from new discoveries last year, while CNOOC had value creation of about $1.8 billion.', 'French major Total took fourth place, with about $873 million in value creation from its 2019 exploration activities. Totals value creation from exploration in 2019 was largely driven by the play-opening success with the Brulpadda find in South Africa, says Shenga.', 'In 2020, Rystad Energy expects the global discovered volumes to continue the rising trend of recent years, with the list of upcoming wildcats including several high-impact wells along with some promising probes delayed from 2019.', 'nSource: Rystad Energy']"

Comstocks strategy is to acquire Chesapeakes Haynesville assets during the downturn cycle and maximize cost efficiencies stemming from close proximities of newly acquired wells to the companys existing acreage.', 'Over the past few years, Comstock has focused on lowering operating costs. The company will continue to do so by leveraging over 500 miles of owned gathering infrastructure and by renegotiating new gathering contracts and long-term marketing arrangements to gain access to the Gulf Coast premium markets. If Comstock manages to integrate Chesapeakes assets with reduced operating cost, the combined NPV of such a position can reach approximately US$5.8bn versus US$4.1bn of Comstocks current position.', 'There is a strong positive expectation for natural gas demand growth via new power, petrochemical and liquefied natural gas (LNG) plants but this does not necessarily guarantee a high natural gas price. There is a common consensus in the industry that the US LNG supply glut has started to form and will continue until the early 2020s, putting additional downward pressure on current LNG prices and ultimately impacting natural gas prices as well. This uncertainty will continue to force US natural gas operators into even higher cost efficiencies through larger scale operations which can in turn drive more merger and acquisition (M&A) activity in the coming years.', 'nSource: GlobalData']"

Beyond the Middle East, Russia and Africa, it also has been looking intently at the US, where S&P Global Platts Analytics expects LNG export capacity to more than double to roughly 13.7 Bcf/d by 2025 versus 2019.', 'Seizing that opportunity, Sempra Energys proposed Port Arthur LNG export project in Texas reached a preliminary deal in May 2019 for Aramco to take a 25% stake, including a long-term commitment for 5 million mt/year of offtake from the facility. On Monday, the two companies said they had signed what they described as an interim project participation agreement memorializing key milestones and mechanisms, though a definitive deal is still subject to further approvals and conditions.

Even as restraints pop there, though, discipline appears to be holding up in one crucial corner farther away: the shale patch.', 'The prospect of a conflict-inspired jump in oil prices is, in purely economic terms, like a glass of water in the desert for U.S. energy stocks. The sector closed 2019 as the worst performer of the year and the decade; it has begun 2020 in the green, at least. The short story is that investors have wised up to the benefits of higher oil prices flowing disproportionately to insiders and (by way of drilling budgets) contractors. Hence, exploration and production companies have tried to reset the relationship with investors on a platform of disciplined spending, lower leverage and higher returns. Higher oil prices provide temptation to backslide on this.', 'Thus far, however  and it is very early days in this current crisis  the message from financial markets is: Backslide at your peril.', 'Not so long ago, an event like Thursday evenings assassination of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani would have set off a frenzy in oil prices and the stocks of companies producing the stuff. Yet crude oil is up only a bit more than 4%, while E&P stocks have risen less than 2%. Shares of oilfield services stocks, which would tend to benefit first from any backsliding on drilling budgets, are up even less.', 'Investors may be cautious about taking a definitive view on how things will play out between the U.S. and Iran. Geopolitical events have a habit of spurring oil-price spikes that fade quickly, not least after the attacks on Saudi Arabias critical Abqaiq facility in September. When it comes to E&P stocks, that caution is compounded by the industrys past performance. Indeed, it is illustrative to look at what has happened to valuation multiples now versus September.', 'Energy stocks, alongside oil, had already enjoyed gains in the month leading up to Soleimanis death. This December rally was broad-based, resting largely on hopes of a thaw in another war (the trade one). Hence, despite valuation multiples rising by roughly 0.5-1 turn of Ebitda, on average, for E&P and services stocks, their discounts to the wider market barely changed.', 'Investors would prefer any geopolitical windfall to go into their own pockets or repairing balance sheets. I wrote in late November about the gap that had opened up between heavily indebted E&P companies and less-levered peers in terms of stock-price performance. While all benefited from the December rally, the lower-leveraged names are performing better so far this year (see the original column for details on these custom indices.', 'Similarly, the average spread on energy high-yield bonds had already dropped by roughly 150 basis points from its early December peak. While it tightened a little further on Friday, it remained above 660 points, notably wider than where it went in the immediate aftermath of the Abqaiq attack. It is both telling, and logical, that Occidental Petroleum Corp., which blew a hole in its balance sheet and reputation with last years acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum Corp., announced on Monday morning it had taken the opportunity to hedge more of its production (and will deconsolidate the debt of its pipeline subsidiary, to boot).', 'Even if our worst (or semi-worst) fears concerning the Middle East are realized over the next several weeks, by the time quarterly calls begin, E&P firms would do best to mostly ignore the oil markets gyrations. Investors, like most of us, would prefer to focus on stability and the stuff we can control.', 'nSource: Bloomberg']"

Proponents say there is little or no evidence linking pollution to gas drilling. A common argument is that burning natural gas is more environmentally friendly than burning coal.', 'Some reports indicate individuals may have been harmed during the process, often due to the mishandling of wastewater or improper building of boreholes. Bryan Latkanich, who leased his southwestern Pennsylvania property to Chevron, claims drilling there has caused him and his son health problems and has damaged his property. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Health and Chevron have not found a link between the drilling and his claims. Ultimately at this point, I just want to get a buyout and move my son away from here and myself so we can try to get better and have a normal life, says Latkanich.', 'Whether fracking should be allowed or not has been widely discussed. France, Germany, and Ireland have banned the practice. So have some states, including New York, Maryland, and Vermont.

    "content": "['Long before Saudi Aramco finally made its initial public offering in December, the big questionbigger than the valuationwas: How would Aramco shares be treated by the market?', 'How would the market assess, in real time, an energy company that is disproportionately weighted toward upstream operations in single country, in a volatile region, and with an absolute monarchy that may exert unforeseen control? Would investors treat it like an international oil company (IOC), such as Exxon, Chevron or BP? Or would the market judge the companys shares based on unprecedented criteria?', 'Aramco trades on Tadawul, the local Saudi exchange, so the market for it is relatively muted. Nevertheless, it has entered the portfolios of international investors through funds, including the indexes MSCI and FTSE which have incorporated Tadawul. To some extent, Aramcos shares are still not available to a large enough swath of investors and public trading is still too new to determine exactly how the market sees Aramco. After all, the stabilization period does not end until later this week. On the other hand, the recent dustup between the United States and Iran gives a very useful test for how investors see the Saudi oil firm, and it makes a compelling case that Aramco is an entirely new type of oil business in the eyes of the market.', 'Typically, the value of shares of IOCs rise when the price of oil rises. They make more money when they can sell oil for more money. This is the case even if the cause for the rise in oil prices is a conflict or disaster. For instance, when a hurricane comes barreling into the Gulf of Mexico, there is often fear of damage to offshore drilling platforms. But when the hurricane results in higher oil prices due to production disruptions (or the fear of disruptions), the oil companies see their own stock prices rise.', 'Similarly, as the tensions and then actual conflict between the U.S. and Iran escalated from a killed U.S. contractor to targeted bombings to an assault on an embassy to the elimination of a top Iranian general, the values of shares of bellwether IOCs like Exxon and BP rose. At the start of trading in New York on New Years Eve, BP was at $37.41. By the start of trading on Monday, January 6, it was $39.68, an increase of more than 6%. Exxon increased from $69.02 to $70.3 (1.9%) in that period. Chevron went up from $119.5 to $121.24 (1.5%) in that period. It makes sense that these shares rose, because oil was becoming more valuable and their daily profits rose.', 'Aramco is different. Tadawul is closed on Fridays, so it was not open right after news broke of the American airstrike that killed Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, but Tadawul is open on Sundays. On Sunday and Monday, even with the price of oil rising, Aramco stock dropped from 35 SAR to 34.05 SAR, before rising to 34.5 SAR before closing. (Remember, Aramco is still within its stabilization period after the IPO, so there may be efforts to keep its price from falling).', 'While the IOCs rose on the news of geopolitical tension and higher oil prices, Aramcos price fell. This is likely due, in large part, to the fear that Aramco facilities could be targets for Iranian reprisal, just as Aramco facilities were targeted in September and have been targeted by Houthi forces in Yemen for the past couple of years. But these past attacks on Aramco have never really interfered with the companys ability to make a huge profit. Should Aramco be treated much differently now than an IOC with offshore assets is treated as a hurricane approaches the Gulf of Mexico? Apparently, the market believes so.', 'It will also be important to see how the market deals with the next scandal, political crackdown or human rights issue out of Saudi Arabia. The company is so closely tied to the government and its unique absolute monarchy, that we really dont know how the equities market will treat a publicly traded Aramco in relation to political events in the kingdom.', 'It seems the market is still trying to determine what criteria to use to price Aramco, an upstream-heavy oil company with all of its reserves in one small location in the middle of a tense region and an interconnection with an absolute monarchy. But this past week has demonstrated that, at least for the time being, it will not price Aramco based on the price of oil.', 'nSource: Forbes']"

I would say now we are not forecasting a shortage of supply unless we have a catastrophic escalation which we dont see.', 'Fears of oil disruptions in the Middle East have risen after the US killing of top Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad last week, sending oil prices soaring to touch $70/b for the first time since September. Iran retaliated Wednesday attacking military bases with US soldiers in Iraq.', 'The UAE, OPECs third largest oil producer, says any decision to make up for lost barrels will be a group decision.', 'OPEC always will meet to discuss whatever necessary actions that we need to do, Marzrouei said, in response to a reporters question if OPEC would step in to fill any gap in supplies. Its not going to be unilateral, it will be a group decision.', 'OPEC and members part of the OPEC+ alliance meet next in Vienna in March to discuss their oil production cuts, which were expanded by about 500,000 b/d to 1.7 million b/d for January to March. The cut is even bigger counting Saudi Arabias promise to cut an additional 400,000 b/d.', 'SPARE CAPACITY', 'nIn case of disruption, OPEC would use its spare capacity to fill any gaps, Mazrouei told a forum in Abu Dhabi.', 'If necessary, we will as we always do respond because we care about the world, we care about supplying the world demand, but we have limitations as well, he said.', 'The UAE is boosting its production capacity to 4 million b/d this year, from 3 million b/d.', 'Mazrouei warned that if oil supply is cut it will send oil prices to $100/b and will have a huge impact on the global economy.', 'If that supply is cut, every country in the world will be impacted, he said. The world cant sustain another $100/b oil price and another huge spike, so no one wants that and no can handle that.', 'The minister said he does not expect the key choke point of Strait of Hormuz to be closed or movements through the waterway disrupted. Iran has threatened to close the waterway if war erupts in the region.', 'The Strait of Hormuz is inot only mportant for us but it is important for the world economy and important to the whole supply chain and Iran understands that, he said.', 'Daily oil flow through the Strait of Hormuz averaged 21 million b/d or the equivalent of about 21% of global petroleum liquids consumption in 2018, according to the US Energy Information Administration.', 'GEOPOLITICS PLAGUE', 'nOPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo also told the Abu Dhabi forum that the OPEC+ alliance will continue to work to ensure stability in the oil market and insulate itself from geopolitics plaguing the Middle East.', 'The oil and financial markets have come to accept the OPEC+ agreements intention to ensure sustainable stability in the oil market, Barkindo said. There is a risk to spare capacity if the market is disrupted, he added. Spare capacity is 3 million to 3.5 million b/d, with two-thirds in the Persian Gulf led by Saudi Arabia, he estimated. Yes the issue of spare capacity will come to the fore if there is risk to security of supply, he said. It is in the interest of the global economy for this industry to continue to attract predictable investments that will not only maintain the current supply to meet current demand but also to meet the growing demand and unforeseen circumstances.', 'OIL DEMAND', 'nOil demand continues to grow and the OPEC+ agreement to trim production through March will keep supply in check, Barkindo said.', 'OPEC is also working with its members to improve compliance with output cuts, which for OPEC+ reached well above the target to 146% in 2019. Iraq and Nigeria have promised to improve their compliance.', 'Countries lagging behind for domestic internal reasons are working to overcome their challenges, Barkindo said. We are confident in the course of time they will be able to hit 100%.', 'Mazrouei said economic growth is healthy and supply from shale oil producers is weakening, probably because of environmental and water issues.', 'The US is expected to produce an average 13.2 million b/d of crude oil in 2020, an increase of 900,000 b/d from last year, according to the EIA.', 'Barkindo said shale oil remains important to industry growth.', 'We welcome the continued role of shale oil from the US, we welcome the new status of US being the biggest producer of not only crude oil but liquids, he said. With that comes responsibility to maintain stable oil markets. OPEC alone cannot share this responsibility.

    "title": "Operational Production Costs Have Fallen Globally, Led By The United Kingdom",
    "content": "['Operational production costs in the oil and gas industry have fallen across the globe, with the United Kingdom emerging as a cost-cutting powerhouse among global offshore regions. A Rystad Energy analysis aimed at mitigating currency effects confirms this trend, after examining regional opex reduction per barrel, measured in local currency. The results are clear  from 2014 to 2018 the UK reduced operational production costs by 31%, followed by Norway and the United States with opex reductions of 19% and 15%, respectively.', 'The reduction in operating expenditure is largely the result of offshore regions  such as the United Kingdom, Brazil, Nigeria, Angola, the Gulf of Mexico and Norway  feeling the squeeze of uncertain oil prices, which in turn has driven operators and contractors to nurture operational improvements in pursuit of lower unit prices, says Sara Sottilotta, Oilfield Service Analyst at Rystad Energy.', 'Secondly, with a greater focus on strategic planning, more efficient maintenance management and the increased and improved implementation of technology, opex per barrel of oil equivalent (boe) has fallen. It should be noted, however, that in times of downturn some opex reduction has historically been a consequence of maintenance deferral. This is important to bear in mind, as unplanned outages caused by equipment failure and damages have quadrupled globally since 2013.', 'The UK has experienced the greatest reduction in opex per boe, falling from more than $30 per barrel in 2014 to just $16 per barrel in 2019. The drop is attributable to two main factors: the general increase in production, and the falling share of production from mature fields as new fields came on-stream and old fields were shut-in, Sottilotta says.', 'Changing rotation cycles, the closing of older fields and lower salaries have also contributed to the reduced cost levels. A majority of UK offshore operators switched from two-week to three-week personnel rotations in 2015-2016, generating salary and logistics savings by reducing the number of flights required to shuttle personnel to and from offshore facilities. Still, despite this significant decrease in operational costs, the UK exhibits the highest opex per boe of all major offshore regions due to smaller field size, a fragmented operator landscape, a more mature continental shelf, and a higher number of personnel on board (POB) per produced barrel.', 'In absolute terms, Brazil experienced the second greatest drop in opex per boe, falling from $16 per boe in 2014 to $11 per boe in 2019. This reduction was driven primarily by a significant increase in production, especially from the giant Lula field. Across the globe, opex per boe in Norway is among the lowest, helped by the rising exchange rate between Norwegian Kroner (NOK) and the United States dollar (USD), which grew from an average of NOK 6.3 per $1 in 2014, to an average of NOK 8.3 per $1 in 2017. In contrast, Mexicos operating cost per boe has risen since 2016, the result of decreasing production and an increasing share of production from mature fields.', 'As Figure 2 above illustrates, the UK has achieved the greatest decrease in operational expenditure per production unit, even when considering expenditure in local currency. Norway and the US follow close behind, with each of the three leaders primarily doing business in their respective domestic currencies. It should be noted that Angola and Nigeria typically carry out operational transactions in USD. Because of this, when considering operational expenditure in local currency these countries appear to have experienced skyrocketing opex thanks to soaring local inflation, while real change in opex is likely not as great in magnitude.', 'nSource: Rystad Energy']"

That potentially undercuts calls for a slow winding down of the shale boom, driven by a combination of firms buckling under investor demands for capital discipline, lower forward prices and engineering issues.', 'Producers operating in some of the largest US shale basins have added hedges since Friday, according to people familiar with the trades.

Many firms missed the September rally, as prices quickly came back down following a quick spike after unprecedented attacks on Saudi Arabias oil infrastructure.', 'A number of large trades in the financial options market were booked on Friday, notably some average-price options in the form of three-way collars on the New York Mercantile Exchange for 2020 and 2021, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Those strategies involve a producer buying put spreads  which offer protection against a drop in prices  while selling calls to offset the cost of the insurance. That will limit how much additional profit the producer can make if prices continue higher.', 'Its not just US companies that have been using the recent price rally to increase their hedging levels, as those in the North Sea have also been active, traders said.

    "content": "['In the small hours of Friday (January 2) morning, the global oil market got its first geopolitical jolt of 2020 after a U.S. airstrike in Iraq took out Qasem Soleimani, an Iranian General of the countrys Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and commander of its Quds Force, a division primarily responsible for extraterritorial military and clandestine operations.', 'Soleimanis killing marked the most high profile political assassination in the region since that of another Iranian protg  Lebanese Islamic Jihad Organizations founder and then Hezbollahs second-in-command Imad Mughniyeh in 2008; a man widely thought to have masterminded the 1983 U.S. embassy bombing in Beirut, and described by none other than Soleimani as the legend of our time.', 'However, there are two stark differences between both killings. First off, unlike Mughniyeh, Soleimani was an Iranian national and senior serving military official, and de facto architect-in-chief of proxy operations in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq and Yemen.', 'Secondly, Mughniyehs killing despite being blamed on the Central Intelligence Agency and Mossad, was never claimed by either whereas that of Soleimani was announced by U.S. President Donald Trump on Twitter. It came barely days after Irans Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei had taunted Washington that it could do nothing regionally to his country following a spate of pro-Iran militia attacks on U.S. facilities and the American embassy in Baghdad in December.', 'Add it all up, and it has presented oil market speculators, ever keen on geopolitical risk premiums, with a very unique set of circumstances to take a punt on. Unlike other high profile take-downs of recent years, including that of Al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden (2011) and ISIS leader Abu Bakar Al-Baghdadi (2019), the geopolitical ramifications for the market are visible and direct. Both were wanted terrorists but Solemani was an Iranian state actor.', 'Iran and the U.S. have renewed hostilities since Trump withdrew Washington from the 2015 Iranian nuclear settlement brokered by European governments and the Obama administration in 2018. Since then, the Presidents sanctions have squeezed Irans oil exports from an average of ~3.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in the wake of the settlement down to 2.15 million bpd, going by S&P Global Platts OPEC survey for November 2019.', 'In the intervening period, oil tankers in the Persian Gulf have been attacked and Saudi Aramcos Abqaiq processing facility hit by drone and missile strikes. Blame of these has been apportioned on Iran, something it denies. Irans forces in the Gulf have also detained (and released) oil tankers and cause other maritime harassment.', 'Before the latest escalation, long bets on Brent and West Texas Intermediate front-month futures contracts, i.e. calls on prices going up, were already on the up following OPECs decision to deepen its crude production cuts by 500,000 bpd to 1.7 million bpd at its December meeting.', 'Taking out the actions of more pragmatic physical traders, pre-Christmas commitment of traders data from both U.S. CFTC and ICE pointed to non-commercial traders expanding their collective net-long positions in oil futures to a 12 to 15-month high during the week ended Christmas Eve.', 'Soleimanis assassination has added the metaphorical fuel to the fire in the eyes of some. In European trading on Monday (January 6), Brent futures briefly hit $70.74 per barrel, before falling back to $69.56, up $0.96 or 1.40% intraday at 11:49 GMT, despite there being no actual oil supply disruption as yet. Tired old theories of the Iranians shutting down the Strait of Hormuz or all out war are doing the rounds once again.', 'Both are as unlikely in the wake of the latest flare-up, just as they were following attacks on Abqaiq in September for precisely the same reason  a need for their own self-preservation by Iranian hardliners.', 'A direct strike on U.S. assets would leave Irans own coastline and all its ports vulnerable to a vastly superior American airstrike arsenal. And closing the Strait of Hormuz would be self-defeating to begin with, since it wont last both politically, as China which takes over 40% of its crude imports via the maritime artery wont stand for it, and militarily, as the U.S. would respond.', 'Instead, Iran would respond via its preferred modus operandi  proxy wars the likes of Soleimani facilitated, and the likes of Mughniyeh benefited from. Such disruptive tactics equated to a near $10 per barrel premium in the eyes of many paper traders prior to the U.S. shale revolution, and before Obama and European leaders initially brought Iran back to the negotiating table.', 'Anyone who thinks a return to those days is imminent short of an unlikely all out Gulf War III is kidding themselves, especially given that the U.S., one of the worlds leading crude consumers, is itself on the verge of becoming a net energy exporter and on track to pump in excess of 13 million bpd in 2020.', 'An upper $60s to lower $70s per barrel Brent price range is also likely to bring more non-OPEC crude on to the market, something that was already on the horizon. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), non-OPEC countries will alone add another 2.3 million bpd to their supply in 2020, while global oil demand growth is expected to be typically around 1.2 million bpd.', 'Whats more, firmer $60 oil prices will bolster the troubled finances of fringe U.S. shale players desperately looking to balance their books. It would even prompt Russia, Saudi Arabia and others within OPEC+ to monetize their barrels better, and more of them.', 'However, that wont stop speculative punts given that both Trump and Iran have their own respective idiosyncratic unpredictability. Additionally, unlike the outage caused by Abqaiq attacks, in this case there is no quick fix. But whichever way you look at it  more speculation and more oil barrels are imminent.', 'nSource: Forbes']"

The balance of risks is now neutral or even tilted slightly to the downside.', 'If the pace of global economic activity accelerates again, there is potential for prices to rise sharply, unless Saudi Arabia and its allies boost production in a timely manner.', 'If the global economy disappoints, however, struggling to emerge from its recent slowdown, there are a lot of bullish hedge fund positions to be liquidated, which could drive a sharp price pull back.', 'nSource: Reuters (Editing by Kirsten Donovan)']"

The easing of trade tensions between America and China is positive for the global economy and the oil market, he says. And so are low-interest rates.', 'What about supply disruptions? There is always a chance of further escalation between the USA and Iran, which would create problems, Matsopoulos says.

I think this difference will lead to a supply crunch as existing fields continue their natural 4% annual decline. US shale, especially Permian and Eagle Ford, has been a major new supply source for the last few years but tightening finance, capacity constraints, and challenging geology at current prices will mean that US shale growth will be substantially less in 2020.', 'Meanwhile, theres OPEC, which has been holding its act of restraining oil supply together, according to Park. And there are declining exports from Iran, Venezuela, and Mexico, which are expected to mitigate rising exports from Guyana, Norway, and Brazil.', 'Park predicts an oil price of US$70 to $75 per barrel in 2020.', 'Not everyone is the bullish camp, nonetheless.

And any full blockade will be very much short-lived, he said.', 'MARKET BALANCE', 'Analysts believe that even in the unlikely event of any disruption to Qatari LNG exports, the global gas market could cope.', 'The LNG market is currently oversupplied; hence an interruption to LNG exports from Gulf countries, in the unlikely event such interruption should take place, can be balanced by supplies from outside the region and product in storage at import terminals over a period of weeks, if not months, Morten Frisch, head of UK-based Morten Frisch Consulting, said.', 'Platts Analytics said Monday it did not foresee either a closure of the Strait of Hormuz or an attack on Qatari export infrastructure.', 'But, it said, an interruption of the waterway would effectively place all of the combined export capacity of Qatar and the UAE under force majeure.', 'This would wipe out some 320 million cu m/d of supply from our base case in Q1 or 21% of global liquefaction capacity, Platts Analytics analyst Luke Cottell said.', 'A significant price response would be necessary to signal increased supply from underutilized global LNG facilities, European pipeline supply, as well as demand destruction, Cottell said.', 'Frisch said it would not be in Irans long-term interest to disturb LNG shipping.', 'If Iran should elect to disturb shipping operations, which it has demonstrated it has the capability to do, crude oil and petroleum product tankers are more likely to be the target, he said.', 'Frisch said the LNG shipping market itself could be impacted, though.', 'The LNGC shipping market is tight. If a number of LNGCs should be trapped in the Gulf for any length of time this is likely to increase the current already high LNGC shipping rates substantially, he said.', 'nSource: ', 'nttttttttttntttttnttttttttt']"

The price increases were relatively short lived, and prices returned to pre-attack levels by the end of the month because of Saudi Arabias ability to bring production back online within weeks of the attack and global concerns about demand growth.', 'Throughout 2019, increases in U.S. petroleum production put downward pressure on crude oil prices. In addition, the production increases likely limited the effect on prices from the attack on Saudi Arabia, production cut announcements from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), and U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela that limited crude oil exports from those countries.', 'Outside the United States, crude oil production from major producers such as Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, and Iran declined in 2019.

Let us not forget that the prices are also being supported by the OPEC production cuts which will start happening as we reach March 2020.', 'Also, US-China trade dispute is looking bit more positive now in terms of resolution that has been supporting the crude prices.', 'He further added: In our view Q1, 2020, is the market where we see over supply and hence that was the reason why OPEC had gone for deeper production cuts. From a fundamental perspective there is enough oil in the market to meet the demand growth for Q1 and the price should retreat if the issues are resolved between US and Iran.', 'Talking about crude price for longer term, Gupta said: For Q1, 2020, our initial forecasts were between $62-62.50 per barrel for Brent and now if the prices remain high for few weeks in January and maybe more we could see $3-5 premium to our base forecast.', 'At 1 pm on Tuesday, Brent crude oil price was at $68.45 per barrel.', 'At the moment we havent seen these events impacting supply, so there are fears that the supply could be impacted, but it hasnt happened yet.

    "content": "['The largest oil company in western Europes biggest petroleum exporter wants to drastically cut its carbon footprint.', 'Equinor ASA, which is based in the Norwegian town of Stavanger on the edge of the North Sea, is trying to adapt its business model to a world increasingly alarmed by the fallout of climate change.', 'Eldar Saetre, the chief executive of Equinor, puts it simply. The most important question for us as a company and as an industry  and also for Norway as a nation  is this: how do we remain relevant and competitive?', 'Equinor, which is controlled by the Norwegian state, just launched its most ambitious climate goals to date. The idea is to make oil and gas installations virtually emissions-free by 2050.', 'This isnt politics, its business, Saetre told reporters in Oslo on Monday.', 'Read: Equinor Plans to Make Norway Oil Operations Emissions-Free', 'Equinor, which not that long ago was called Statoil, is betting that lower emissions in the production phase can keep the company competitive. And with roughly a quarter of Norways total emissions coming from Equinor, any cuts the company can achieve would make a meaningful difference to the whole country.', 'To be sure, the emissions caused during production represent just a small fraction of the total over an oil barrels life cycle. And other oil companies are chasing more ambitious goals. Repsol SA of Spain said last month it would cut all emissions by 2050, including from the products it sells, as opposed to Equinor.', 'Political Debate', 'In Norway, which has become one of the worlds richest countries thanks to its vast oil reserves, figuring out how to adapt to climate change is becoming an increasingly fraught subject. Its $1.1 trillion sovereign-wealth fund (locally dubbed the oil fund) has tried to exit fossil-fuel stocks. But Norway has so far proved unable to wean itself off oil.', 'Calls from activists and some politicians for an end date to oil production are growing more frequent. Meanwhile, uncertainty over key parameters such as industry taxes has grown.', 'Equinor stressed that its emission cuts depend on stable framework conditions. In an interview, Saetre said he hopes the steps Equinor is taking will strengthen and make more robust the political support the industry has enjoyed.', 'This is something we dont wish to be dragged into, he said. We want to be at the forefront and the drivers seat.', 'Equinor and its partners plan to invest about 50 billion kroner ($5.7 billion) to reach a first target to cut emissions by 40% by 2030. That will mostly be done by connecting offshore platforms and onshore plants to Norways electricity grid, which is dominated by clean hydropower. Reductions will then reach 70% in 2040 and almost 100% by 2050.', 'Though the investment needed to switch to clean energy in the production stage will have a neutral to positive net present value, Saetre said the expectation is that Equinor will become more cost competitive over time, as carbon pricing increases.', 'Good Enough?', 'Equinors efforts to reduce its carbon footprint will bring it in line with the overall climate goals of Norway, which is a signatory of the Paris Agreement. But the measures are unlikely to satisfy drilling opponents, given that the cuts do nothing to address emissions from the oils combustion, which makes up more than 90% of the total.', 'These ambitions ignore the elephant in the room, said Mark van Baal, the head of Dutch investor advocacy group Follow This. An oil company with targets for its own emissions, and not for its products, is like a cigarette producer that promises that all employees will quit smoking, while increasing cigarette production.', 'A good illustration of why activists are concerned can be found in the giant Johan Sverdrup field in the North Sea, which is being officially opened on Tuesday by Prime Minister Erna Solberg. Its slated to continue pumping oil for several decades after starting in October. Emissions from the field are way lower than those elsewhere in the industry, at less than 1 kilogram of CO2 for each barrel thats produced. But emissions from the oil itself, if all 2.7 billion barrels are used, would amount to more than 20 times the annual total for Norway.', 'The new targets will obviously have a positive reputation effect in Norway, said Klaus Mohn, an economics professor at the University of Stavanger. But I dont think it will be enough to calm the debate about the industrys future.', 'nSource: Bloomberg']"

However, a broader direct military confrontation between the US and Tehran in the Middle East would have an even bigger impact on energy trade flows in a region that produces a fifth of the worlds oil.', 'Iran will have to retaliate in some form or another, said Anoush Ehteshami, professor of international relations at Durham University and a regional expert. Soleimani was no ordinary figure, and the charisma he carried in the region cannot be underestimated. I would expect a wave of reaction across the Middle East, but I dont think they will target oil.', 'As head of the elite Quds brigade of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corp, Soleimani was seen as the biggest single threat to US foreign policy interests in the region.', 'An architect of Tehrans military strategy to extend its influence in Iraq, Syria, Yemen and the Lebanon, he rose to prominence during the Iran -Iraq war in the early 80s. A close ally of Irans Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, his death leaves the regime in a precarious position and only reinforces the martyrdom narrative, Ehteshami said.', 'Pushed into a corner, Iran may seek to directly confront the US militarily, or more likely stoke anti-American sentiment amongst its Shiite Muslim allies.', 'The risk of major escalation has moved into new territory, but we still put the odds of a broader US -Iran conflict below 50/50, according to S&P Global Platts Analytics. Of course, any disruptions from conflict would be covered by OPEC, which has over 2 million b/d of spare capacity.', 'Middle East tensions rise', 'nTensions and security are already high around oil, which has become a target over the last 12 months in the Persian Gulf and its key shipping lanes.', 'Iran and the militia it supports were blamed for attacks on Saudi Arabias giant Abqaiq and Khurais oil plants last September and a series of unproven strikes earlier in the year on tankers anchored near the mouth of the Persian Gulf or in the Red Sea.

It will bring the speculators back to the oil market.', 'A risky strategy', 'nEliminating one of Americas most ardent enemies within the Iranian regime by drone strike is a risky strategy for US President Donald Trump to take. A war with Iran could be ruinous for his re-election hopes in 2020 if higher oil prices push the cost of gasoline well above $3/gal.', 'However, oil market fundamentals appear to be in Trumps favor. S&P Global Platts Analytics expects more oil supplies to come on stream this year in Brazil, Norway and Canada, adding to stockpiles.', 'Of more immediate concern will be the threat to American nationals and US oil companies operating across the Middle East, which could now be targeted directly by Tehran, or its proxies in revenge attacks.', 'Exxon Mobil, the largest US international oil company and operator of the giant West Qurna field in southern Iraq, said it was closely monitoring the situation in the wake of Soleimanis death.', 'The US government told its citizens to leave Iraq immediately.', 'The problem now in the Middle East is the spread of small wars everywhere, said Al -Attiyah, who now heads the Abdullah bin Hamad Al -Attiyah International Foundation for Energy & Sustainable Development. You can see it in Sudan, in Yemen, Libya, in Syria and Iraq.', 'However, Trumps advisors may hope Soleimanis death adds to the pressure building on the Iranian regime to eventually negotiate a new nuclear deal with the US on Washingtons own terms and rein in its regional meddling especially in Iraq.', 'Sanctions have already reduced the countrys oil production to its lowest level in 30 years. The loss of oil income has crippled the economy, triggering street riots late last year after the government was forced to increase subsidized fuel prices. Its currency has halved in value and GDP fell by more than 9% last year.', 'Soleimani was essential for Khameneis regional policies, said Ehteshami.

Geng said that by doing so, however, they would be in violation of their non-proliferation obligations.', 'The South China Morning Post reported Geng saying that, China will continue to maintain close communication and coordination with all related parties, and will take relentless efforts to save the nuclear deal and avoid greater conflict in the Gulf.', 'Iran Nuclear', 'nTechnicians seen at the Arak heavy water reactor in Iran on December 23, 2019. Oil rich Iran says it  [+]ASSOCIATED PRESS', 'nThe Iran nuclear deal was signed under then-president Barack Obama in the summer of 2015. But the deal has had its critics ever since, with some saying the U.S. was basically bribing Iran not to enrich uranium for nuclear weaponry.', 'Iran has been fighting a proxy war with the United States and its allies since the fall of the Washington-backed Shah of Iran. Soleimani was a lead soldier in that fight, and has since climbed the ranks to lead the elite Quds Force. He was blamed by Washington for leading a militia attack on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad on December 31.', 'Brent crude oil prices rose to $70 in intraday trading on Monday morning, but have since fallen below $70. Texas crude is still pricing in the low $60s, up half a percent following a rash of pro-Iran militia attacks against U.S. facilities this weekend.', 'Chinas Foreign Minister Wang Yi reportedly held telephone conversations on Saturday with the foreign ministers of Iran, Russia and France, reiterating that China would not back U.S. military strikes on Iran. China, France and Russia are permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. That body has a weapons ban on Iran in place since 2010, set to expire in October of this year.', 'China will continue to uphold an objective and just position, Wang said, adding that China will help safeguard peace and security in the (Persian) Gulf.', 'On Friday, Chinas top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, spoke with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and urged the U.S. not to start a regional war in the Middle East.', 'China Leaving Iran Oil Market', 'Last week, Russias Vedomosti business daily sourced an unnamed diplomat who surmised that Iran would retaliate by blocking free shipping through the Strait of Hormuz. The U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates that roughly 35% of all seaborne traded oil, or almost 20% of oil traded worldwide, goes through that Strait.', 'The Strait curves through the coasts of Oman and Iran and is a key transit route for Saudi Arabian oil into China.', 'Chinas imports of Saudi oil have hit a record high of late due to sanctions on Iran and dwindling resources in Venezuela, making that body of water very important to Chinese oil supply.', 'China imported 8.21 million tons of crude oil from Saudi Arabia in November, pushing the total volume for 11 months to a record 76.33 million tons. Thats up 53% from the same period in 2018, based on numbers crunched by Caixin Global, a Chinese business news publisher.', 'Saudi imports go through the troubled Strait of Hormuz and the Red Sea, which borders Yemen, a country the Saudis are fighting a proxy war with Iranians.', 'The Tehran financed Houthi militia attacked a Saudi ship passing through the Red Sea in 2018, a troubling sign for oil security and price stability that is so important to China.', 'Most of Saudis oil goes through Hormuz, an easier shut off valve for the Iranians.', 'This summer, Soleimanis Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps seized a British-flagged oil tanker called Stena Impero. The Iranian military accused the tanker of violating international regulations. The move was likely yet another tit-for-tat operation that followed the U.K.s seizure of an Iranian oil tanker off the coast of Gibraltar.', 'Irans oil exports have declined severely due to Trumps decision to unilaterally reimpose sanctions on the country.', 'China has since turned to the Saudis, no longer able to trust Iran as a reliable source due to geopolitics.', 'Chinas Saudi purchases beat the 70.3 million tons imported from neighboring Russia, once their top source for crude, and the 47.08 million tons coming from Iraq.', 'China recently abandoned Venezuelas dying crude oil business in October and again in November due to sanctions threats. Ongoing trade talks with Washington may have had something to do with that as well.', 'Meanwhile, imports of Iranian oil fell by nearly half to 14.36 million tons for the year ending in November.', 'The surge in Saudi imports come at a time when the Saudis were aggressively expanding Aramcos downstream business through Chinese joint ventures in petroleum refining, storage and sales. Two joint refineries  Hengli Petrochemical and Zhejiang Petrochemical  were granted import quotas of 24.30 million tons of oil in total in 2019, and the volume is expected to keep growing in 2020 as Beijing loosens restrictions governing private companies in the energy sector and as the surprising twist in the Iran crisis should continue to keep China away.', 'China does not need Iran as much as it used to.', 'Beijing does not want escalation of conflict because of the stress it puts on oil tanker transit routes to China. Both the U.S. and Washington have a strategic interest in keeping those lanes drama-free.', 'With the Phase 1 trade deal expected to be signed next week in Washington, investors will be looking for whispers of China and the U.S. agreements over Iran, potentially keeping a lid on military escalations.', 'nSource: Forbes']"

The move has effectively splintered the legal framework of the country.', 'It provides another blow to Juan Guaido, and opposition momentum more generally, while directionally raising the odds of explicit US secondary sanctions on PDVSA, said Paul Sheldon, chief geopolitical advisor with S&P Global Platts Analytics. Tougher US penalties are even more realistic in an election year, but further punitive measures on Venezuela may not be a top priority at this point, as many sanctions-averse buyers already ceased transacting with PDVSA.', 'According to analysts with ClearView Energy Partners, Maduros actions Sunday could compel the Trump administration to allow a waiver allowing Chevron, Halliburton, Schlumberger, Baker Hughes and Weatherford International to continue certain work with PDVSA, outside of US sanctions, to expire on January 22.', 'In October, the US Treasury Department extended that waiver, known as General License 8D, for three months. It was the second extension of that waiver, initially issued in January 2019, when the bulk of US sanctions on Venezuelan oil flows went into effect.', 'The waiver has been extended based on the argument that the presence of US companies is necessary to prevent the complete collapse of Venezuelas oil sector, easing an expected recovery once Maduro was forced out of power.', 'That argument was likely weakened by Maduros moves Sunday, ClearView analysts wrote.', 'And, with a US presidential race approaching, the Trump administration may be increasingly wary of the appearance of going soft on Maduro by offering sanctions leniency, they said.', 'In a statement, Ray Fohr, a Chevron spokesman, said Chevron was hopeful that the waiver would be renewed, so that we can continue operations in the country for the long-term.', 'If Chevron is forced to leave Venezuela, non-US companies will fill the void, and oil production will continue, Fohr said.', 'nMORE SANCTIONS', 'While Abrams gave little insight Monday into the sanctions being considered, he indicated they might target Russian and Cuban entities that have continued to support the Maduro regime.', 'We underestimated Cuban and Russian support of the regime, Abrams said.', 'Abrams said that roughly 70% of current Venezuelan oil trade is currently handled by Russian companies, including marketing, financing and facilitating ship-to-ship transfers of oil in order to complicate surveillance.', 'A senior Trump administration official told Platts in August that the US was prepared to sanction Russian oil company Rosneft if it continued to trade crude oil and fuel with PDVSA, but analysts said those sanctions have yet to be imposed because of the expected impact they may have on the global oil market.', 'Analysts with ClearView said that, while the US is unlikely to sanction Rosneft, it could target affiliated entities or subsidiaries operating in Venezuela.', 'Fernando Ferreira, a senior analyst with Rapidan Energy Group, said Monday that all sanctions remain on the table.', 'While it is unclear whether Washington is willing to kick out the last remaining US oil companies doing business in Venezuela, we ultimately expect tighter US sanctions will continue to drive production down, he said.', 'According to the latest Platts OPEC survey, Venezuela produced 700,000 b/d of oil in November, up 50,000 from October, but down 1.7 million b/d from October 2015.', 'Ferreira said he expects Venezuelan oil output will stabilize at about 1 million b/d with US sanctions remaining in place.', 'Platts Analytics forecasts Venezuelas oil output to decline to 600,000 b/d by the end of 2020, but the introduction of secondary sanctions, similar to the sanctions the US has imposed on Iranian oil exports, could cause Venezuelan oil output to fall below 400,000 b/d.', 'nSource: ', 'nttttttttttntttttnttttttttt']"

The LNA presence in the southwest is also strengthening, but they will be unable to prevent continued pipeline disruptions during 2020.', 'Paul Sheldon, geopolitical adviser at S&P Global Platts Analytics, said there would be frequent and sustained supply disruptions if the stalemate over Tripoli continues.', 'Around 400,000 b/d of supply is most at risk, given its locations outside of the LNAs eastern stronghold, according to S&P Global Platts Analytics.', 'General Haftars control of the major fields appears to hinge on tenuous alliances with local militias. Elsewhere, the vacuum created by Haftars Tripoli offensive could eventually cause his many rivalsto move on oil facilities under his control, while jihadists could capitalize on unstable civil war conditions to target infrastructure, Sheldon added.', 'Sheldon said the general consensus is that an LNA victory would likely benefit oil production, as Libyan supply only stabilized after he gained control of the countrys major fields and export facilities.', 'AMBITIOUS TARGETS', 'nNOC has set its sights on boosting oil production to 1.50 million b/d next year from current levels of 1.25 million b/d.', 'This rise assumes 350,000 b/d of new output coming online next year, but that will be slightly offset by a natural decline rate of 7-8%.', 'Mohammad Darwazah, a director at Medley Global Advisors, said NOCs plans to boost production by 350,000 b/d appear ambitious although he also noted that 2019 showed the resilience of Libyan crude output.', 'While the NOC recently secured $1 billion in funding from the Central Bank of Libya, security problems coupled with a lack of foreign engineers and investment will likely limit Libyas potential upside to 100,000 b/d, Darwazah added.', 'Longer term, Sanalla hopes to raise oil production to 2.1 million b/d and gas output to 3.5 Bcf/d.', 'THE RETURN OF THE IOCS', 'nThese targets are dependent on improved security keeping supply-side disruptions to a minimum but they are also tied to more involvement from international oil firms.', 'Lack of security has kept many IOCs away but it seems 2020 could see a fresh start for some of them in the war-torn country, which contains the largest oil and gas reserves in Africa.', 'Frances Total and NOC recently finalized an agreement giving the oil major a minority stake in one of Libyas most lucrative set of oil blocks.', 'Total has been keen to increase its presence in Libya, and this follows a tried and tested model for the French energy major which has been successful looking for higher returns in risk-prone areas.', 'Total will help NOC in developing the North Gialo and NC 98 fields in the Waha license, increasing production by 180,000 b/d and investin $650 million to the development of this concession.', 'Russian oil company Tatneft meanwhile has resumed upstream work in Libya after more than five years.

Tensions in the Middle East escalate to a fever pitch, one side strikes a stunning blow in the never-ending shadow war against American hegemony in the oil-rich region, and crude prices spike on fears of an oil shortage. ', 'But then tensions calm, the oil keeps flowing and prices come back to earth.', 'As the unprecedented attacks on key Saudi Arabia oil facilities showed last September, its not easy in this era of abundance to establish a geopolitical risk premium in global oil markets or sustain a price rally.', 'Thats why those traders betting on higher oil prices after Fridays killing of Gen. Qassem Soleimani, Irans most senior military commander, in a U.S. drone attack in Iraq should err on the side of caution.', 'Iran has pledged to retaliate, and it showed last year that it can significantly disrupt Middle East oil markets in several ways, including pestering tankers in the Strait of Hormuz, hitting critical pipelines and ports, and, most spectacularly, attacking Saudi oil fields and facilities, an event that temporarily halved Saudi oil production.', 'But perhaps the most telling story of oil markets in 2019 was how quickly oil prices retreated to pre-attack levels in the days following that September 14 attack. ', 'A well-supplied oil market, both in terms of spare production capacity and inventories, rendered the attacks a virtual non-event. Thats incredible given that the loss of production from OPEC-leader Saudi Arabia  known as the worlds central banker for oil  was, in the past, considered a doomsday scenario by veteran oil analysts.', 'Sure enough, the price of oil on the international benchmark Brent hub pushed higher on Friday, at one point peaking at $69.50  its highest level since the Saudi oil facilities were attacked. But gains were quickly pared as the session wore on, with the price closing up around $2 at over $68 a barrel.', 'There are some reasons to believe that this time will be different and that a real risk premium of perhaps $3 to $5 a barrel could now be built into oil prices. ', 'Unlike in September, oil prices at the end of the year were on a roll before the January 3 killing of Soleimani, boosted by OPECs latest supply cut deal and an improved global demand outlook as a result of the phase one trade deal between the U.S. and China. ', 'Another factor favoring higher prices is the slowing of U.S. shale oil production growth. That would be sufficient in a normal market to prompt a rally in oil prices if retaliations escalate between Tehran and Washington. The reality, though, is that it may take a full-blown war in the region to make oil prices move substantially higher  such is the extent of the oversupply of oil in the market at the moment.', 'Even with the combined effect of slower non-OPEC production growth and deeper OPEC cuts, the International Energy Agency recently stated there could still be a surplus of 700,000 barrels a day in the global oil market in the first quarter. Other analysts see the surplus in the first half at 1 million barrels a day or higher.  ', 'Its important to remember that Saudi-led OPEC and its allies are deliberately holding back roughly 2 million barrels a day of production to make room for still growing non-OPEC supplies, to keep oil markets balanced and support oil prices.', 'That is 2 million barrels a day that could be brought on virtually overnight if necessary. ', 'The IEA assesses global spare capacity at roughly 3.1 million barrels a day, of which some 2.1 million barrels a day is in Saudi Arabia. Another source of supply resilience is due to come online later this year when the Wafra and Khafji fields in the Saudi Arabia-Kuwait neutral zone return, adding roughly 500,000 barrels a day.', 'Of course, thats contingent on oil capacity in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Kuwait  all U.S. allies  remaining unaffected. That remains an unknown as Iran looks for targets to retaliate against without directly attacking U.S. forces. ', 'Tehran may well believe it has to respond to the U.S. drone attacks to save face with hardliners within its government Soleimani was immensely popular. But Iran is typically strategic in its attacks on the West, depending on proxies in Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen to give it deniability.  ', 'But there are also roughly 3 million barrels a day being held back by U.S. sanctions and civil strife. Sanctions on Iran and Venezuela wont ease anytime soon, but the output from conflict-stricken nations like Libya, Nigeria, South Sudan, Yemen and Syria could increase if political and security conditions in those states improve.', 'That is a massive amount of spare capacity  even if some of it cant be tapped immediately, it has a significant effect on oil-market psychology.', 'The supply cushion doesnt end there either. Consumer nations around the world have built up massive inventories of crude oil and petroleum products, both in commercial and strategic stockpiles. Many import-dependent Asian countries have been preparing for a supply disruption in the  Middle East since tensions with Iran started escalating last Spring. ', 'As of November, the IEA gauged OECD commercial petroleum inventories at roughly 2.9 billion barrels, equivalent to the trailing 12-month average and enough to cover about 60 days of demand.', 'Meanwhile, strategic petroleum reserves in the OECD are 1.5 billion barrels, and China is believed to now have around 1 billion barrels stockpiled  enough to cover more than 80 days of demand. All that surplus oil is helping to offset geopolitical fears. The bottom line is that the world should have more than sufficient crude oil on hand to cope with any slowdown caused by Iran.', 'Another important factor that shouldnt be discounted is the United States recent transformation into a net exporter of petroleum after decades of being a major importer. The combination of a decade of rising production thanks to the shale boom and growing exports of refined petroleum products, has redrawn long-standing oil trade patterns and reduced dependence on Mideast oil significantly for many big consumer nations. ', 'The very fact that the Trump administration can challenge Iran so aggressively is because the United States  and the global economy  is no longer beholden to Mideast oil as it was in the past. ', 'None of this is to say that recent events cant have a significant impact on oil markets. ', 'All-out war in the Middle East between Iran and its many proxies and the United States and its allies in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Kuwait, and Israel, would be an extremely messy affair. Iran already targeted oil facilities and shipping lanes before the killing of Soleimani. And the front line of any conflict may very well be Saudi Arabia and Iraq  OPECs two largest oil producers. ', 'That cant be discounted. ', 'But with non-OPEC oil supplies growing rapidly, and an ample spare capacity cushion and huge oil inventories to lean on, the market looks well-prepared for whatever tomorrow brings.', 'nSource: Forbes']"

Since the creation of the GSCI in 1991, WTI and Brent have been the GSCIs highest and second-highest weighted commodities, respectively, so both the GSCI and the energy sub-index tend to follow major price movements of these crude oils.', 'Prices of many nonenergy commodities tend to move in the same direction as energy commodities. For instance, because consumers use more copper and more crude oil when the economy is expanding, copper prices and the Brent crude oil price typically move together.', 'Conversely, precious metals such as gold and silver are typically seen as safe assets with values that increase with economic contractions.

With the US exporting a lot of ethylene and a lot more capacity coming from petrochemical crackers and so forth, you have a lot of ethylene available in the market, and if you have an economy driver like China weakening that is not a good sign, a source with a Middle East producer said.', 'The pressure from poor margins saw Asian crackers mull run cuts, however naphtha demand has persisted as LPG has been comparatively pricey, sources said.', 'TIGHT LPG SUPPLY FROM THE GULF', 'nLPG supply from the Middle East, which has been mainly taken by China via new and bigger term contracts to meet the rising number of propane dehydrogenation plants, as well as by India, would be limited by lower crude output and associated gas in 2020, following the decision by OPEC, Russia and its allies in December to steepen production cuts to 1.7 million b/d from 1.2 million b/d, with Saudi Arabia offering an extra 400,000 b/d in voluntary cuts starting January.', 'Lower Saudi oil production had led to cuts and delays in Saudi Aramcos acceptances of January loading term nominations, which together with delays by ADNOC and Qatar had sent Asian and Middle East LPG prices up to around one-year highs.', 'With no signs of an end to US sanctions, especially in light of the current tensions following the killing of Soleimani, Iranian supplies are also expected to remain scarce.', 'The LPG market will also see more diverse global cargo flows to meet growing demand from North Asian petrochemical makers led by China and South Korea, while India and Indonesia will see expanding demand from households.', 'LPG exports, which have already started from new terminals in Canada and Australia in 2019, are expected to continue to make their way to this region, trade sources said. China will remain keen to take cargoes from such new supply outlets  including from West Africa  as it is expected to continue to grapple with the uncertainty of US supply amid the ongoing trade tensions.', 'Recent propane export tenders by Canadas Altagas were reportedly won by Oriental Gas, trade sources said, enabling the Chinese PDH operator to assess North American supply and leverage freight savings due to the proximity of the 1.2 million mt/year Ridley Island terminal across the Pacific.', 'However, with growing optimism for a US-China trade deal, after US President Donald Trump said on December 24 that he and Chinese President Xi Jinping will have a signing ceremony for the phase-one trade deal that was agreed by the two countries earlier in December, the market would need to factor in the eventual return of US LPG into China.', 'Still, industry sources did not expect Chinas 26% tariff on US propane and 31% tariff on US butane imports to be removed soon, despite the progress made reaching the agreement to ink a phase one trade deal.', 'Before tariffs were imposed, China imported nearly 3.6 million mt of US LPG in 2017.', 'nSource: ', 'nttttttttttntttttnttttttttt']"

The risks are pretty high. While Trump is still favorite, we still could see a progressive candidate come out with the nomination. It would be bad news for the US oil industry.', 'Among the highest polling candidates, populists Senator Elizabeth Warren (D, MA) and Bernie Sanders (I, VT) have pushed hardest for policies aimed at severely limiting the US oil sector, including a ban on exports, fracking and leasing on federal waters. Other candidates, including frontrunner Senator Joe Biden (D, DE), have taken a more measured approach, not committing to all-out bans, but indicating that new limits and additional regulation would be considered.', 'If [President Donald] Trump wins it is status quo, but any Democrat  even if its not a populist  would be under tremendous pressure to throw the base a bone and this is a bone they could throw, Confluence Investment Management chief market strategist Bill OGrady said.', 'US oil output has surged in recent years following the lifting of a decades-old crude oil export ban in late 2015 that allowed producers to ship surplus barrels abroad. Previously, most US production had to be consumed domestically by refineries, the bulk of which are tooled to run cheaper heavy, sour crude imports from the Middle East and Venezuela. This limited domestic appetite effectively put a ceiling on the mostly light, sweet crudes being produced in the Permian and other tight oil plays.', 'The build-out of significant US Gulf Coast pipeline infrastructure during the Trump administration further incentivized US production by de-bottlenecking West Texas oil plays and propelled US crude output and exports to records heights in 2019. US crude production steadily increased in 2019 to more than 12.8 million b/d in December from around 11.8 million b/d in January, and exports soared to a weekly peak of 4.46 million b/d in late December, according to US Energy Information Administration.', 'OUTPUT GROWTH SLOWING', 'nUS output growth is already slowing, with producers unwilling to boost spending and drilling at current prices, and capital drying up. A recent Dallas Federal Reserve survey showed the industry is already concerned about increasingly limited access to capital, stagnant prices and looming bankruptcies in the Permian and other US shale plays.', 'If Trump wins, its helpful for oil supplies in the short run, OGrady said. The market would take a populist victory as bearish for oil stocks, but probably bullish for prices as it would reduce supply.', 'On average about a quarter of US crude production has been exported each week in 2019. With US refineries maxed out on how much light sweet crude that they are willing to take, an export ban would likely flood local storage capacity and force producers to cut output or risk glutting the market.', '[A Democrat] wouldnt have Congressional support across the board so some restrictions might be hampered, but I think you would see further consolidation in the industry, and even the mention of an export ban would weigh on the sector, Moya said.', 'Crude export facilities along the US Gulf Coast have grown their capacity to export from about 5.4 million b/d at the start of 2019 to a current estimate of about 7.7 million b/d, according to S&P Global Platts Analytics. And that capacity will likely grow to over 8 million b/d in 2020, as several major infrastructure projects are expected to start up.', 'Oil commodity markets are so far not yet pricing-in these policy risks, analysts said, but volatility is expected to increase during the second half of the year as the November election draws closer. Instead these risks have mostly manifested in the energy equity space.', 'Energy stocks have struggled to keep up with an equity price boom. The S&P 500 Energy Index finished 2019 around 5.5 % higher, compared to a nearly 29% annual increase in the broader S&P 500 Index, S&P Global Platts data shows.', 'Energy equities have been a real laggard this year, we have come to the conclusion that this is not a one off, but part of a broader trend. If energy stocks continue to languish, we probably will see drilling activity roll over, oil stocks tighten and prices rise, OGrady said. This looks like a direction thing, this election could accelerate or decelerate this process, but I think this trend is in place.

    "content": "['Over the New Year holiday, pro-Iran militiamen surrounded the United States embassy in Baghdad. Ultimately, and thankfully, the American personnel remained unscathed, but it was a further reminder of the political unrest that continues to dominate that country. It also reminds us of the potential disruption that more unrest in Iraq could impact global oil markets.', 'In recent months, Iraq has experienced large-scale protests by citizens who oppose Iranian interference in their country. The country also saw the murder of hundreds of these protestors. Earlier this week, the U.S. struck targets in Iraq and Syria that were linked to Iran-backed militias. ', 'This political unrest brings with it a potential for a real disruption to the global energy markets. In 2018, Iraq produced more oil than all but four other countries. Though reliable and updated numbers are not yet available, its oil production increase in 2019 and it is probably now the fourth largest oil producer in the world. This past summer, it produced 4.88million barrels per day. But just this past week, on December 28 and 29, protestors were able to shut down an oil field that produces 90,000 barrels per day.', 'Iraqi oil has been less than reliable on the global market for some time. Until recently, ISIS controlled some of the countrys oil. In the last 17 years there were also disruptions due to the military engagements caused by the U.S. invasion, conflicts between the Iraqi government and the Kurdish authorities and efforts to rebuild the countrys oil infrastructure after Saddam Husseins regime and then war. In the 1990s, international sanctions and the United Nations Oil For Food program limited the sale of Iraqi oil. In the 1980s, Iraq engaged in an eight-year war with Iran that disrupted oil production and exports.', 'However, lately Iraq has been producing and exporting record amounts. It typically overproduces its OPEC quota. If the situation in Iraq deteriorates further in 2020, we could see real disruptions to the oil market that last more than just a couple of days, which could scare the market.', 'nSource: Forbes']"

    "title": "Equinor aims to cut emissions in Norway towards near zero in 2050.",
    "content": "['Equinor yesterday launches new climate ambitions to reduce the absolute greenhouse gas emissions from its operated offshore fields and onshore plants in Norway with 40% by 2030, 70% by 2040 and to near zero by 2050. By 2030 this implies annual cuts of more than 5 million tonnes, corresponding to around 10% of Norways total CO2 emissions.', 'Equinor supports the Paris agreement and a net zero target for society. We have already brought CO2-emissions in the production process down to industry leading levels. We are now launching an unprecedented set of ambitions for forceful industrial action and substantial absolute emission reductions in Norway, aiming towards near zero in 2050. This is in line with societys climate targets and our strategy to create high value with low emissions, says Eldar Stre, CEO of Equinor.', 'While realizing these ambitions, we also expect our operated fields and plants to create significant value with a potential to generate more than 3.000 billion Norwegian kroner in income for the Norwegian State towards 2030. New fields, field life extensions, improved oil and gas recovery and efficient operations will all contribute to substantial value creation. The new climate ambitions will strengthen future competitiveness and value creation for Equinor, while supporting industrial developments in Norway, says Stre.', 'Collaboration is key to combat climate change. We appreciate the close cooperation with our industry partners and suppliers, and to realise these ambitions we need even closer collaboration across industries and with authorities. We plan investments in the order of 50 billion Norwegian kroner together with our partners by 2030 to cut emissions in order to strengthen the long-term competitiveness for our fields and plants. In setting these ambitions Equinor has assumed stable framework conditions and necessary investments in the electricity grid, says Stre.', 'The first phase of the plan to reduce emissions by 2030 means more than 5 million tonnes in annual reductions, representing around 10% of total annual Norwegian greenhouse gas emissions today. Similar as for the EU ETS targets, 2005 is used as a baseline for emissions reductions.', 'Total emissions for Equinor operated fields and plants in 2018 were around 13 million tonnes, approximately the same level as in 2005. The ambition will cover all greenhouse gas emissions from offshore fields and onshore plants operated by Equinor in Norway, including both Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions of CO2 and methane. Since methane emissions are very low at the Norwegian continental shelf, the CO2-emissions is the predominant part.', 'A 40% reduction by 2030 will be realised through large scale industrial measures, including energy efficiency, digitalisation and the launch of several electrification projects at key fields and plants, including the Troll and Oseberg offshore fields and the Hammerfest LNG plant.', 'The 2030 ambition will require investments of around NOK 50 billion for Equinor and its partners. Subject to positive investment decisions in the licenses, these investments will have neutral to positive net present value, in addition to strengthening future competitiveness.', 'Further reduction ambitions towards 70% in 2040 and close to zero in 2050 will entail additional measures, further electrification projects, consolidation of infrastructure as well as opportunities to develop new technologies and value chains.', 'In 2050, Equinor expects Norwegian oil and gas production to be less than half of current levels, assuming development of the defined projects ahead of us, substantial efforts to increase production from existing fields and continued exploration.', 'Equinor aims to utilize its capabilities within innovation, technology and large-scale industrial solutions to develop new competitive value chains. Currently Equinor is pursuing and maturing opportunities within offshore wind, carbon capture and storage and emissions-free hydrogen based on natural gas.', 'The ambitions will support the development of new value chains within hydrogen and carbon capture and storage and help ensure that the Norwegian continental shelf and onshore plants can play an important role and create value in a world with net zero emissions.', 'In setting ambitions for substantial cuts towards close to zero emissions in 2050, Equinor has assumed stable Norwegian framework conditions, including the tax system, and necessary investments in the onshore electricity grid. A continuation of the industrys NOX-fund and other positive measures can support substantial emissions reduction.', 'Setting ambitions for substantial cuts in emissions in Norway is an important step in aligning Equinors business with the Paris Agreement. Equinor will present new corporate climate ambitions and a holistic climate platform, including an approach to decarbonisation and life cycle emissions, at the Capital Markets Update in February.', 'nSource: Equinor']"

Itll make Iranian sanctions look somewhat tame, said Trump, speaking to reporters on Air Force One, according to a CNBC report.', 'The lack of market focus on longer-term oil supply risk was underscored by a widened backwardation in the Brent forward curve.', 'Meanwhile, supporters of embattled Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, possibly capitalizing on a US focus in the Middle East, on Sunday blocked the re-election of opposition leader Juan Guaido in the National Assembly, according to media reports. The US had previously recognized Guaido as Venezuelas legitimate president, and levied sanctions against the Maduro regime and the Venezuelan oil sector.', 'According to ClearView Energy Partners, Maduros actions may lead to more sanctions from the US.', 'Venezuelan oil output averaged 650,000 b/d in October, up from 600,000 b/d in September, according to the latest S&P Global Platts survey. Venezuelan oil production has fallen by 1.24 million b/d over two years.', 'S&P Global Platts Analytics estimated Venezuelan oil output would fall to 375,000 b/d by the end of 2020, in its low-case scenario, under which Maduro retained power, the US imposed secondary sanctions similar to its Iran oil sanctions and creditors accelerated their pursuit of PDVSA assets.', 'nSource: ', 'nttttttttttntttttnttttttttt']"

Even companies that already went bankrupt could be helped if rising prices boost assets and cash flow projections, giving creditors a bigger pie to divide up.', 'More Drilling?', 'Oil producers are evaluating their capital spending budgets for the year, and increased cash flows in 2020 from higher oil hedges could tempt them to boost production, Cutter said.', 'Investors have pressured oil companies in recent years to spend within their means, and the most troubled companies havent been able to increase production. But drilling more wells isnt necessarily good for distressed-energy bondholders, Cutter said.', 'If youre a bondholder, you see this as a nice little windfall and you can get more mileage from a credit perspective by paying down debt, he said.

Since the end of the quarter also represented the end of the year, I will also cover the top-performing energy companies of the year.', 'The S&P 500 returned 8.5% during the fourth quarter, and an impressive 28.9% for all of 2019. The rally in 2019 was broad-based.

The XLE represents the stocks of large energy companies from different sub-sectors (e.g., integrated, oil production, equipment services). It is, therefore, a good benchmark for conservative energy investors. Some of the XLEs biggest holdings are ExxonMobil, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, EOG Resources, and Schlumberger.', 'During the third quarter, the XLE generated a total return of 5.5% (including dividends). For all of 2019, the XLE returned 11.7%, but some segments of the energy sector outperformed even the S&P 500.', 'The most impressive energy sector performances in 2019 came from the midstream sector. These are the companies that transport and store oil and gas. But within this sector, the midstream corporations turned in outstanding performances, while the midstream companies that are structured as master limited partnerships (MLPs) generally lagged behind.', 'The Top 20 midstream companies rose by an average of 15.9% for the year, but a different picture emerges if we look at just the midstream corporations. Major midstream corporations like Enbridge, TC Energy (formerly TransCanada), and Kinder Morgan respectively returned 36%, 56%, and 44%. Enterprise Products Partners, the largest MLP, returned 21.9%. TC Energys return was the best among the Top 20 midstream companies.', 'The integrated supermajors returned an average of 2.3% for the quarter, and 8.8% for the year. Every member of this group was in positive territory in 2019, but Chevron was the only member with a double-digit return (+15.3%).', 'The 20 largest upstream companies averaged a return of 10.5% for the quarter, following declines in both the 2nd and 3rd quarters. For the year, this group returned 9.6%.', 'In general, the Canadian upstream companies handily outperformed their U.S. peers, with many turning in gains of over 30%. However, the top performer in the Top 20 was U.S.-based Hess, with a 68% return for the year. At the bottom of the pack was Occidentals 28% decline for the year. This decline was caused by negative reactions to Occidentals buyout of Anadarko.', 'The Big Three refiners  Marathon Petroleum, Valero, and Phillips 66  were up an average of 6.8% for the quarter and 23.4% for the year. Both Valero and Phillips 66 turned in a 2019 gain of over 30%, while Marathon lagged behind with a gain of 6.1%.', 'The biggest drag on the energy sector continues to be depressed oil and natural gas prices. The problem in the oil sector is primarily too much supply, and not because of softening demand. Its an important distinction, because oversupply can be resolved. But market perception seems to be largely that of softening demand.', 'It will take a while for bearish sentiment to shift, but I believe its premature for investors to abandon oil-related opportunities. There were plenty of opportunities in the sector in 2019, if one knew where to look. That will also be the case in 2020.', 'nSource: Forbes']"

    "content": "['On Monday, the 30th, ESAI Energy wrote that conflict between the U.S. and Iran is a military as well as economic contest and that oil facilities in the region remain at risk. Last nights U.S. attack, killing the leader of the IRGC Quds Force, was described as pre-emptive self-defense designed to deter future Iranian or Iranian-supported attacks. Iran will see its response in similar terms: a need to demonstrate to Washington that the U.S. cannot kill senior Iranian leaders without paying a significant price. At this moment, we expect retaliation to be in the region, most likely in Iraq. This could have significant impact on crude oil prices. Statements that the oil market has tremendous spare capacity and can easily weather a new disruption are glib and misleading. An extended period of conflict in the region will support prices by fueling uncertainty, even as alternative suppliers step up.', 'Last night outside of the Baghdad airport, the U.S. attacked and killed the head of Irans Revolutionary Guards Quds Force Qassim Soleimani and Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, the deputy head of the Iranian-backed Popular Mobilization Forces in Iraq. Soleimani was one of the most powerful and influential figures in Irans government. U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper stated that the U.S. strike was aimed at deterring future Iranian attack plans. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told foreign counterparts that the U.S. remains committed to de-escalation. Irans Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has vowed severe revenge.', 'The U.S. has framed its attack as pre-emptive self-defense designed to deter future Iranian or Iranian-supported attacks. Iran will see its response in similar terms: a need to demonstrate to Washington that the U.S. cannot kill senior Iranian leaders without paying a significant price. Irans overriding goals vis--vis Washington remain the same: to reduce U.S. influence in the Middle East and to get out from under sanctions. Layered on top of this now is the requirement to demonstrate to Washington and its own people that the Iranian government can defend itself. Defense, in this case, very likely means retaliation. Iran has a range of targets available: U.S. forces in the region, U.S. embassies and diplomatic personnel worldwide, U.S. citizens abroad, and U.S. partners and allies and their citizens and infrastructure. An attack may not be immediate; Iran has lost its lead planner and operational commander. But it will almost certainly occur.', 'In addition to any kinetic response or responses, Iran will want the Iraqi government to demand that remaining U.S. forces leave Iraq, and Tehran will use the incident to consolidate recently shaky domestic support within Iran. Escalation spirals are very possible. Despite Secretary Pompeos words, Washington may feel compelled to respond to any future Iranian attack. In addition, U.S. and Iranian forces  operating in close proximity in the region  will be on very high alert and local commanders may take actions that spark a clash. Iranian allies, such as Lebanons Hezbollah or militia forces in Iraq, may act on their own against U.S. targets. Finally, this attack will almost certainly have a significant impact on Irans beliefs about the need for it to develop a nuclear weapons capability.', 'For the moment, we expect the next Iranian response to be in the region. The implications for the crude oil market revolve primarily around (1.) the possibility of further military action impacting oil operations in Iraq, including the countrys 4.6 million b/d of crude oil production and almost 4.0 million b/d of crude oil exports. And (2.) the possibility of strikes on or near other oil facilities in the Arab Gulf that would inhibit exports by Iraqs neighbors such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.', 'nSource: ESAI Energy']"

    "content": "['Enverus, the leading oil & gas SaaS and data analytics company, has released its summary of 2019 deal activity and its outlook for 2020. Enverus tracked $96 billion of U.S. oil & gas M&A in 2019, including $11 billion in Q4. However, the annual total was substantially skewed by Occidentals $57 billion acquisition of Anadarko, which was also the largest deal of the decade and the fourth largest oil & gas deal ever.', 'Backing out the Occidental/Anadarko deal, 2019 saw $39 billion in deals or just one-half of the average $78 billion for annual U.S. oil & gas M&A during the last 10 years, which also saw the rise of U.S. unconventional assets. M&A played a key role along the way, with $567 billion spent on shale assets or 73% of the total during that time. E&Ps poured even more into funding drilling, including major ramp ups of oil output in the Bakken, Eagle Ford, and Permian Basin. However, the available capital that made shale possible largely dried up in 2019.', 'Top Five Deals of 2019', 'Investors who funded the shale revolution over the last decade have become vocal in advocating for payouts and cut back on providing new capital. That flowed through to limited M&A and a negative reaction to deals for much of the year, said Enverus Senior M&A Analyst, Andrew Dittmar. However, we saw an uptick in December in the pace of deals and more positive investor reactions to acquisitions. That should bode well for M&A in 2020.', 'Occidentals acquisition of Anadarko highlighted 2019s consolidation in the shale patch. The deal is in the ballpark of Exxons 2009 acquisition of XTO as the most spent on shale in a deal. Occidental saw 75% of Anadarkos value in shale, including the Permian Basin.', 'Most of 2019s other marquee deals also focused on the Permian. After Occidental/Anadarko, 2019s largest corporate deals were Callons $2.7 billion merger with Carrizo, WPXs $2.5 billion buy of private Felix Energy II, and Parsleys $2.3 billion acquisition of Jagged Peak.', 'WPXs $2.5 billion acquisition of EnCap-funded Felix in December 2019 was notable for several reasons. Besides being the largest deal of Q4 and fourth largest deal of 2019, the acquisition of a premier private equity position in the Permian shows there are still exits available for the built to sell model of private equity portfolio companies. WPX also outperformed the broader markets on news of the deal, compared to most buyers being sold off on news of M&A.', 'Top Five Deals of Q4 2019', 'The Permian continues to be a key driver of U.S. oil growth and a significant contributor to M&A including accounting for more than 60% of Q4 2019 value. From a buyers perspective, there are opportunities to shop for private equity portfolio companies that are ready for an exit or acquire the small and mid-cap public companies that have been beat up on Wall Street.', 'During the second half of 2019, smaller E&Ps showed an increasing willingness to accept lower buyout values as capital markets remained tight and financing options narrowed. Less well-capitalized companies that are still short of self-funding and generating positive free cash flow, have a limited set of options to avoid running up debt and facing a restructuring. Besides selling, some are turning to private capital to provide alternative financing options.', 'Challenges for one company can mean opportunity for someone else and were seeing that on the private capital side, remarked Enverus Market Research Director, John Spears. During the exploratory and high growth years of shale, private equity was funding companies to drill and flip acreage. Today, private equity is providing a secondary source of capital to companies that need to grow but dont have the financial means via joint ventures, drillcos, purchasing overriding royalties, and other arrangements.', 'Tight capital raising options for potential sellers is one side of the equation for an M&A surge in 2020. However, for would-be buyers the outlook is more positive. After a year of cutting costs and focusing on efficiencies, larger companies look ready to turn the corner on free cash flow and are instituting dividends and share buybacks to reward investors. Their stock prices are also on the rise, aided by a combination of their own operational improvements and tailwinds from an improving global economic picture and rising oil prices.', 'As investors grow more confident in a companys ability to deliver on free cash flow, they also become more open to acquisitions, provided asset quality is high and the price is reasonable. In addition, larger E&Ps should be better positioned to deliver on returns to investors by leveraging economies of scale, more efficient development, and more favorable service and midstream contracts. Consolidation in the shale patch can either take the form of acquisitions by multi-nationals or mergers among the smaller to midsize players like was seen in 2019.', 'In the last ten years, we watched U.S. shale upend global energy markets and transform the U.S. into a net energy exporter, concluded Dittmar. Were now at an inflection point where shale matures from a growth industry to one that generates dividends and share buybacks for its investors. Completing that transition and setting the stage for the next ten years will likely require a round of consolidation and 2020 sets up the needed pieces for this to occur.', 'Top 10 Deals of the Last Decade', 'Source: Enverus']"

tanker shipping in the Strait of Hormuz and on oil installations in Saudi Arabia had only a transient effect on prices because of plentiful shale production and slack global oil consumption growth.', 'The increase in oil prices following Soleimanis killing, with front-month Brent futures up by around $2.50 per barrel (4%), suggests oil traders think the pattern will be repeated.', 'The small rise in Brent indicates traders are so far pricing in a low but non-zero probability of significant uncontrolled escalation across the region disrupting oil supplies.', 'ESCALATION CONTROL', 'nBoth countries insist they are prepared for a full-scale armed conflict, while saying they do not seek it or think it likely.', 'Both have pursued a mixed strategy of escalation (increased sanctions, attacks on oil infrastructure) and containment.', 'And both have signalled at various times that they want to avoid provoking a full-scale and uncontrolled confrontation.', 'The United States has pursued a policy of strategic patience to give sanctions time to work, rather than resort to heavy armed force, in the belief a weakening economy will eventually force Iran to negotiate on more favourable terms.', 'The U.S. government believes time is on its side so there is no rush to bring the economic and military conflict to a crisis, which could also weaken support for its sanctions policy among its European and Middle East allies.', 'In turn, Iran has pursued its own version of forward defence, trying to push the conflict away from its own territory into neighbouring states, and raise the cost of sanctions on the United States and its allies.', 'MISCALCULATION RISK', 'nSoleimanis killing represents a serious escalation of the conflict because he was identified as the architect of Irans forward defence policy.', 'It remains unclear why the United States selected such a high-value target at this particular point, especially since it will likely provoke reprisals and impose some costs on U.S. intelligence collection efforts.', 'Iran will likely review its operational security and conduct a counter-intelligence sweep to identify the source of information that enabled the United States to locate its commander in real time.', 'The killing is likely to impose real costs but presumably the White House and senior decision-makers decided they were worth it to send a strong deterrence signal to Iran and reassure regional allies about U.S. resolve.', 'It remains unclear whether Soleimanis killing will mark a shift in the strategic calculations of either party (Strait of Hormuz and the risk of uncontrolled escalation, Reuters, June 13, 2019).', 'But the biggest risk has always been that a miscalculation by one or both sides, or their allies, could lead to spiralling conflict, possibly spreading to multiple sub-theatres across the Middle East.', 'Coercive diplomacy requires exquisite calibration of the degree of pressure to ensure controlled escalation does not spiral into uncontrolled escalation.', 'Previous escalations, including attacks on shipping in the Strait of Hormuz, oil installations in Saudi Arabia and the downing of a U.S. military drone, have all been followed by a successful effort to reduce tensions.', 'Contained conflict probably reflects the strategic preferences for both countries, but the more incidents, and the more serious they become, the greater the risk that one will provoke an uncontrolled escalation.', 'nSource: Reuters (Editing by David Evans)']"

While much of the success in Guyana already is reflected in Hess stock price, the company could see further uplift when cash from the development begins to flow in, he said.', 'Bet of the Century', 'The genesis for Hess success was in 2014, when crashing oil prices spurred Royal Dutch Shell Plc to pull out of its 50-50 partnership with Exxon in Guyana.

The alliance, which was forged in Algiers in 2016, has been limiting production since January 2017 with a view to providing some level of stability in oil markets following the price crash between 2014-16. It continues to grapple with the reality of the US being the most dominant player in the global oil industry, though. Its collective action this year could bolster prices but it remains to be seen for how long the group can sustain the deeper cuts, which have only reluctantly been agreed to by some members.', 'US-China trade war', 'nThe trade tensions between the US and China weighed on oil for much of 2019, keeping Brent crude resilient to geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and restricting pricing to a tight band between $55 and $60. Uncertainty over the resolution of the trade war has been one of the biggest drivers of oil markets. Consensus over a phase one trade deal has appeased markets, prompting a rally towards the end of 2019, with the freeze of tariffs boosting sentiment for the global economy, which has been plagued by recessionary fears. The two sides are set to sign the phase one deal on January 15. However, there is still work to do. US President Donald Trump has vowed to start work on the phase two deal, which includes stickier points such as restrictions on Chinas subsidies to state-owned firms. How this plays out next year ahead of Mr Trumps re-election campaign will also be a deciding factor for the oil markets.', 'US Elections', 'nThe United States will decide on its new president this year, with Mr Trump campaigning to be re-elected. He has become one of the most important factors impacting oil prices, with his pronouncements via Twitter on Opec or the trade war causing prices to rally or slump. Mr Trump was influential in coaxing Opec+ to reverse production cuts in 2018 in order to moderate prices to appease voters ahead of the midterm elections.', 'Should Mr Trump win re-election, there would be a continuation of US energy policy albeit more intense, said Randolph Bell, director of the Atlantic Councils Global Energy Centre.', 'So thats a deregulatory agenda in the United States and a lack of action on climate change, he said. This would, however, prompt more of a leadership role on the climate change front from US tech companies, he added. Left-leaning Democratic candidates such as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, on the other hand, have been campaigning for stricter action on climate change and have also proposed a ban on fracking, which could hurt the US energy industry and challenge its dominance as the worlds top producer. Yet such a scenario seems unlikely, Mr Bell suggested. [A] ban on fracking would require the support of the US congress. Thats really off the table and these promises are for campaign purposes than for real, he said.', 'nSource: The National ']"

Here are five.', 'A trigger point for climate change', 'nNew EU legislation could be the catalyst. The EU leads the world in aspiration and policy, and a new regime is cranking up the pace. The green deal, legislation planned for Q1 2020, envisages a binding commitment to net-carbon neutrality by 2050. Another EU initiative that could galvanise global acceptance of carbon taxes are border tariffs. These aim to protect EU-produced goods from cheaper imports with a heavy carbon footprint. The timing for new legislation sets up COP26, the UN climate conference, in Glasgow in December 2020 as a possible turning point for climate change. Global emissions have risen since the Paris Agreement five years ago. COP26 must commit the 196 Paris signatories to the tougher emissions reductions now needed to get the world on track for a 2 C pathway.', 'US election and geopolitics', 'nThe November presidential election could have big implications for energy markets. Domestically, the US oil and gas industry fears a backlash after the halcyon days of this Trump term. A Democratic victory would change the agenda, the question is how far  to Obama-plus under Joe Biden or that of a hard-core environmentalist? The Warren proposal to ban fracking hints at the latter, though its doubtful Washington has the requisite power to cut the legs off shale gas and oil development. Globally, a change in administration would be impactful. Theres the possibility of re-signing the Paris Agreement; the US-China trade dispute; and US foreign policy which, emboldened by tight oil growth, has reached far and wide under this administration. For starters, what would the Democrats do about sanctions on Iran and Venezuela that are keeping 2 million b/d of crude exports off the market? A second Trump term will mean more of the same from these last four years.', 'The global economy and oil demand', 'nNo recession, but global GDP growth slid from 2.9% in 2018 to 2.3% in 2019 with the US-China trade dispute weighing on industrial production. Oil demand disappointed, growing at half the rate forecast at the start of the year. In 2020, we expect a bounce in oil demand growth despite tepid GDP growth of 2.4%. We forecast 1.35 million b/d, more than double the 0.6 million b/d of 2019 (the lowest since 2011). One-offs depressed 2019 whereas 2020 demand will be boosted by marine diesel in China and NGLs for new US petrochemical capacity. Any repeat of demand disappointment will add to the pressure OPEC+ is under to balance a fundamentally oversupplied market.', 'Sector credibility', 'nThe industry has done a dismal job in convincing equity markets and the wider public of its role as the energy transition plays out. The global economy needs oil and gas for some decades yet. Its up to oil and gas companies in 2020 to present themselves in a better light  as part of the solution rather than the problem. Whats needed? A plan to maximise cash value for shareholders from the core oil and gas value chain. A plan to measure, reduce and eliminate Scope 1, 2 and even Scope 3 emissions. A plan to adapt to an energy market thats decarbonising. That will be a start. Repsol, aiming for net-carbon neutrality by 2050, has set a bold example. Other IOCs  and NOCs  need to follow.', 'Gas  financing a key transition fuel', 'nGas, with its low-carbon intensity on burning compared to other fossil fuels, has a critical role to play in balancing the intermittency of solar and wind power through the transition. Global gas demand looks resilient for the next two decades and beyond, and the industry is onto it  planned LNG projects are at record highs. But policy makers and capital markets are moving fast  will finance be available for the huge investment needed? The European Investment Bank is the latest to withdraw from the sector, and will cease funding coal, oil or gas projects after 2021. The industry needs to work harder in 2020 to demonstrate the benefits of gas and its environmental credentials  in tandem with carbon capture and storage  to ensure that finance for much-needed gas projects doesnt dry up.', 'nSource: Wood Mackenzie']"

    "content": "['Russias crude oil and condensate output hit a post-Soviet high last year even as it curbed production under an agreement with OPEC.', 'The 11th consecutive year of output growth underscores the reality of Russias cooperation with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Despite being one of the architects of the original 2016 deal, Moscow has a poor record of fulfilling its pledged production cuts and has come under pressure from its allies to do better.', 'The country consistently failed to meet its quota last year, overshooting its target in nine of the 12 months, Bloomberg calculations show. The Energy Ministry has come up with various explanations for producing above the target  from the limitations of a harsh climate to technical issues after the Druzhba oil-contamination crisis.', 'Russia produced 560.2 million tons of oil in 2019, up 0.8% from the previous year, preliminary data from the Energy Ministrys CDU-TEK unit show. Thats equivalent to 11.25 million barrels a day, according to Bloomberg calculations. Russia produced a record 11.416 million barrels a day in 1987, BP Plc data show.', 'Under the OPEC+ deal, Russia pledged to cut output by 228,000 barrels a day from the October 2018 baseline of 11.418 million barrels a day. That allocation will change this month after OPEC and its allies agreed in December to deepen their cuts.', 'New Arrangements', 'Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman has urged the laggards in the deal to carry their share of the burden. The kingdom is making the deepest cuts in the group.', 'Russia has agreed to deepen its reductions by 70,000 barrels a day to about 300,000 a day in the first quarter. But its baseline and monthly production calculations will exclude a type of light oil called condensate, potentially making it easier to hit its cuts target.', 'Energy Minister Alexander Novak has denied that the change is a loophole allowing Russia to pump more oil and still claim compliance. While Russias official statistics dont yet provide a breakdown for crude and condensate, the ministry will regularly inform analysts, the media and OPEC about the composition of its output, according to Novak.', 'Russia has also started making noises about the future of the OPEC+ alliance. When ministers meet next in March, the group will have been restricting output for more than three years, compared with an initial plan for six months. During the meeting, Russia may bring up the issue of exiting the agreement, Novak said in an interview to state TV network Rossiya24 last month.', 'Oil production cuts cant be eternal, Novak said, adding that Russia needs to defend its global market share and let its oil companies develop new projects. We will gradually need to make a decision on exiting the accord, he said.', 'Ending the deal would allow Russia to deploy about 500,000 barrels a day of spare production capacity, which could pave the way for a new output record in 2020.', 'nSource: Bloomberg']"

    "title": "European fuel oil markets face a whirlwind of change in 2020",
    "content": "['The International Maritime Organization-mandated reduction in sulfur limits for fuels burnt on the high seas from January 1, 2020 will bring the biggest change to oil product markets in decades.', 'Fuel oil trade flows and historic supply-and-demand dynamics will alter radically next year with refiners and shippers trying to comply with the rules. A greater appetite for lighter and sweeter crudes at one end and a loss of demand for dirty fuels at the other will have far-reaching implications across Europe and beyond.', 'Northwest Europe is expected to be balanced to long for 0.5% sulfur fuel oil in 2020, according to market sources, following the completion of several refinery upgrades, and increasing imports of sweet crude barrels which produce lower sulfur fuels.', 'Prior to the lower sulfur cap regulation, Northwest Europe was net long 3.5% sulfur fuel oil, sending supply east to Singapore as well as down to Mediterranean ports. However, as forecast by Platts Analytics, declining demand for 3.5% fuel oil is set to see a collapse in the east-west arbitrage.', 'The East-West spread  which measures 380 CST Singapore fuel oil cargoes against 3.5% suflur FOB Rotterdam barges, indicating the openness of the arbitrage east  has widened towards the end of 2019. The average spread across Q3 2019 was $47.65/mt, considerably higher than the figure for Q3 2018 at $15.19/mt. Despite stronger values, Platts has not seen an increase in the number of vessels heading eastwards. As the deadline approaches, with volatile prices and dropping demand for higher sulfur fuel oil, traders became increasingly less likely to try and work the arbitrage for fear of being stranded withproduct and no buyer.', 'Whether the arbitrage between Singapore and Rotterdam will continue for 0.5% in the same way it traditionally did for 3.5% remains unclear.', 'Meanwhile, the Mediterranean, known for its complex refining capacity, is expected to reverse its position from being net-short HSFO, to net-long for 0.5% marine fuel, as companies look to use low sulfurstraight run fuels in their bunker pool.', 'Demand for light sweet crude grades across Europe has risen as refineries adjusted their slates for lower sulfur oil production ahead of the regulation, with sources noting that demand for Algerias premier grade has particularly benefited as it is an ideal grade to blend with heavier and sourer barrels.', 'Algerian low-sulfur straight-run fuel oil  always highly prized for its quality  is drawing attention from refiners globally. European and Singapore-based players have been paying high values to import LSSR from Skikda, Algeria, when typically about 80%-90% of those cargoes would have headed to the US, one source said.', 'Approximately 400,000 mt of LSSR per month is exported from the 335,000 b/d refinery complex at Skikda, with the US traditionally having been a key buyer, particularly during the summer months to producegasoline.', 'Thus, a tug of war has emerged between several countries willing to pay higher values for Algerian barrels.', 'nWEST AFRICAN QUALITY', 'West African grades have also received increased interest. Some refiners which previously never bought West African crude have now entered the market as IMO 2020 changes the landscape for crude buyers, according to sources.', 'Looking at the availability of compliant fuels in Europe, the share of 0.5% fuel oil sales in the bunker pool in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp region and in the western Mediterranean has already surpassed 90%, market sources said mid-December.', 'However, the amount of supply available in Europe, and a potential surplus for arbitrage opportunities, is still in question. Traders have told Platts they believe the European market is more likely to fill local shorts rather than export product. One market participant told Platts that the time and costs incurred in building a 0.5% sulfur cargo for arbitraging east were not viable as traders will struggle to find buyers who will meet the price.', 'nRUSSIAN UPGRADES SLOW', 'Russias fuel oil output dropped significantly in the last few years, down from about 80 million mt a few years ago to about 50 million mt in 2018. This figure will likely remain stable in the next few years until all refinery modernization programs are completed. Some refineries, like Lukoils Volgograd, switched to 0.5% fuel oil, whereas Perm fully halted fuel oil output, but upgrades are progressing more slowly at others. Lukoils Nizhny Novgorod and Gazprom Nefts Omsk target completion and subsequent fall of fuel oil output around 2021, but for Gazprom Nefts Moscow refinery the timeline is 2024 while Rosneft, which operates the majority of Russias biggest refineries, plans to complete its refinery modernization program by 2025.', 'The 13 million mt/year bunker market is expected to contract next year, which potentially will add to the export flows. With fuel oil exports accounting for almost 90% of output, Russia is looking at ways to ease the pressure by increasing bitumen output and deferring the sulfur cap on bunker fuel used on its internal waterways.', 'But a new excise planned by the Russian government from April 2020 is likely to put even more pressure on refineries as the tax will likely push domestic fuel oil prices up and hit local demand. Analystsare already questioning the timing of this measure.', 'nEMERGING EXPORTING MARKETS', 'Interestingly, with historic patterns changing in light of a cleaner era of bunker fuels, new players to the bunkers market are being watched closely for their supply impact to the wider market. In particular, eyes are on China and Brazil 0.5% sulfur marine fuel flows.', 'The top four state-owned refiners in China have commenced production of VLSFO which could boost production capacity to 18 million mt/year in 2020, according to data from the Marine Bunker Exchange. Previously, China was a small player in fuel oil production despite its large refining sector due to its use of the product for domestic consumption and being hit by value-added taxes, analysts from ESAI have said. As China takes advantage of greater low-sulfur fuel oil exports opportunities from a potential tax refund, VLSFO production is expected to rise by 27.9% to 550,000 b/d early next year to potentially dominate the regional bunker market, ESAI said.', 'In addition, Brazils state oil giant Petrobras said in its Q3 sales report that IMO 2020 had created export opportunities for low-sulfur fuel oil, particularly in the Singapore market.', 'nSource: ', 'nttttttttttntttttnttttttttt']"

    "content": "['After a fairly abysmal 2019 for U.S. energy mergers and acquisitions, investors are signaling to oil executives and investment bankers that the days of big-premium deals are over.', 'Some of the years most notable mergers, including Occidental Petroleum Corp.s blockbuster takeover of Anadarko Petroleum Corp., were met with investor criticism and the sustained selling of the acquirers stock. Shareholders are demanding more discipline on spending from oil and natural gas producers after years of negative cash flow and disappointing returns that have left the sector out of favor.', 'The market does not want to see large premium deals get done, said Steve Trauber, Citigroup Inc.s global head of energy. The market has reacted negatively, in some cases violently so, when those deals are announced.', 'There has been $76.2 billion of mergers and acquisitions targeting U.S. exploration and production companies in 2019, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Thats the highest going back at least 21 years, but its skewed by the takeover of Anadarko for $53 billion including debt. While the deal count rose to 37 from 32 last year, it remained below the number of transactions seen at the start of the decade, when oil and and gas prices were higher.', 'Generally its been a slow year for dealmaking, said Brittany Sakowitz, a partner at Vinson & Elkins. I see 2020 being a lot of the same.', 'Only one major energy deal this year came with effectively no premium: PDC Energy Inc.s acquisition of SRC Energy Inc. It was also perhaps the only transaction between two public oil producers to be widely applauded by analysts and investors. Unusually for an all-stock takeover, the shares of the acquirer, PDC, surged on the day the deal was announced.', 'When asked by one SRC shareholder why he didnt get a premium for his stock, the companys Chief Executive Officer Lynn Peterson replied that he had created a stronger, larger business with a lower cost of capital, according to Citigroups Trauber. An SRC spokesman confirmed thats how Peterson has defended the merger.', 'Thats the mantra investors have and want to see, Trauber said.', 'What Bloomberg Intelligence Says:', 'It would be difficult for management teams to agree on a low- to no-premium deal, especially considering they would tend to view it relative to where their stock prices were just one to two years ago', ' Vincent Piazza, senior analyst', 'What investors dont want are expensive deals. Occidental outbid Chevron Corp. and secured a $10 billion commitment from Warren Buffett to buy Anadarko. But its stock is now headed for the worst annual performance in two decades. Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn has said Occidental paid too much, and hes pushing ahead with efforts to replace the companys entire board, people familiar with the matter said last month.', 'The bidding for Anadarko initially sparked optimism that widespread consolidation may finally come to the crowded Permian Basin. But those hopes were dashed after just a few smaller oil producers followed suit, including Callon Petroleum Co., which acquired rival Permian operator Carrizo Oil & Gas Inc. Callons shares tumbled 16% on the day the deal was announced and extended their decline after public opposition from investor Paulson & Co. Callon was eventually forced to cut the takeover premium to get the deal done.', 'The buyside does want consolidation, but they want it at very low premiums, and they want it for significant synergies, said Tim Perry, co-head of Credit Suisse Group AGs oil and gas investment banking group. Those are the kinds of deals they will support.', 'Still, the lack of a premium may act as a disincentive for some energy executives, as they would stand to receive less for their equity and stock options in a takeover than they otherwise might have done, at least in the short term.', 'If youre the CEO and somebody comes and says, I want to acquire you, youre going to have to pay a pretty big premium in order for me to lose my job, said Noah Barrett a Denver-based energy analyst at Janus Henderson Group Plc, which manages $360 billion. Self-preservation is a huge behavioral factor in the decision-making process for these guys.', 'nSource: Bloomberg']"

While IMO 2020 and increasing production in Alberta push differentials weaker in the early months of the year, the Alberta governments ongoing production cap and the prospect of both increased rail and pipeline takeaway should put a floor on how much WCS can weaken, the trader said.', 'Platts last assessed WCS at Hardisty at a discount of WTI CMA minus $21.75/b, which is down $6.75/b during 2019 so far. The blend reached its weakest level of $22.90/b on December 12, as inventories built following a temporary shutdown of the Keystone Pipeline starting in late October, and a week-long rail strike in November that halted shipments from the countrys biggest crude-by-rail operator. WCS had risen to as high as WTI CMA minus $6.95/b in January, shortly after the Alberta government implemented a cap on production January 1 to buoy differentials.', 'Alberta officials gradually increased the output cap throughout the year, from an initial 3.79 million b/d to 3.81 million b/d in December, January and February. Several traders said that while they see Alberta maintaining a cap through much of 2020, they do not see the government raising the production limit.', 'They are not going to lower it just to raise it again, one trader said.', 'With no new pipelines set to come online in 2020, traders have said they are expecting increased flows on existing infrastructure and more rail shipments to help support differentials. Pipeline operator Enbridge reaffirmed during its third-quarter earnings that optimization projects will add 100,000 b/d of capacity to its mainline system.

Platts Analytics expects crude-by-rail exports out of Western Canada to have rebounded in December with the rail arbitrage opening due to more favorable pricing and a government incentive program for rail shippers.', 'Crude exports by rail from Western Canada are expected to hit 354,000 b/d in December and 390,000 b/d in January, according to Platts Analytics. After dipping during spring refinery maintenance season, rail exports out of Western Canada are expected to average nearly 400,000 b/d during the second half of 2020.', 'While increased rail flows may support differentials in Alberta by draining tanks, they may push heavy crude prices lower on the US Gulf Coast, traders said.', 'As more barrels land, the differential could widen out, one Calgary-based trader said.', 'Platts last assessed WCS at Nederland, Texas, at WTI CMA minus $4.15/b, down $2.25/b from where it began the year.', 'Platts Analytics sees the Western Canadian oil supply growing by 265,000 b/d in 2020 year on year as a result of the rail deal and increased pipeline capacity.

However, on a m-o-m basis, we expect different trends to emerge.', 'The 2020s may be the last decade with oil demand growth continuing while the peak global oil demand is expected sometime in the early 2030s. he added', 'Michael Dei-Michei, Head of Research, JBC Energy said: Much like the last decade it was really a tale of two opposites. After prices averaged just a tad above $100 per barrel from 2010-2015, the combined forces of US shale and growing OPEC production forced prices to correct quite dramatically and the second half of the decade saw average price levels of only around $55-$60 per barrel.', 'While US shale growth is indeed slowing down and OPEC+ shows ongoing determination to support markets, it is still impressive and surprising to see this strength at a time of weak demand growth and sluggish refining margins. The one thing we can say with certainty is that the crude market is ending this decade on an exceptionally strong note he added', 'Robin Mills, CEO, Qamar Energy said: The quite strong finish to the year will give OPEC some comfort, heading into what could be a difficult first half of 2020. OPEC will want its alliance to hold together, the reasonably optimistic demand forecasts for 2020 to bear fruit, and the signs of a shale slowdown to be enough to outweigh new production from Norway, Brazil and Guyana.', 'In the longer view, the 2010s were an exceptionally strong decade for oil prices, probably the highest-priced ever in real terms, even after the late 2014 crash. Supply disruptions in the first half of the decade and robust growth out of the Great Recession, were only partly offset by the early part of the shale boom. Will OPECs alliance overcome electric vehicles, climate policies and other headwinds to record another strong price performance in the 2020s he added', 'nSource: Dubai Mercantile Exchange (DME)']"

There are three things to watch.', 'First, the lower prices will help U.S. consumers in the form of lower fuel costs. The cost of gasoline pump prices and futures prices for crude are inextricably linked over the long term. In other words, sooner or later, the falling oil prices translate into lower pump prices.', 'Still, as the crude market slumps expect gas prices to dip and U.S. consumers to spend the cash theyve saved at the pump, thus helping boost the economy.', 'That should help lift prices of consumer discretionary stocks such as those held by the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY) exchange-traded fund. These companies, which include General Motors and Amazon.com, typically sell things that people want but dont always have to buy, such as a new car.', 'On the other hand, energy stocks, such as those held in the Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) ETF, might not do so well because of the subdued crude prices.', 'Then there is Saudi Arabia and the other the oil-producing countries in the region. Lower oil prices mean lower government revenues. Unfortunately, unlike in the U.S. or European Union, there are few other sources of revenue to offset the decline.', 'In the case of Saudi Arabia, any oil price below $77 means that the government is spending more than it is raking in. While Saudi has a large stash of cash in its coffers, other countries have less and may feel the strain in their economies more.', 'In other words, investors should expect growth in the region to get hampered by falling energy prices next year.', 'nSource: Forbes']"

The think-tanks projections point to an increase in U.S. exports of crude and refined products from 550,000 bpd in October 2019 to average 750,000 bpd in 2020.', 'Market doubts persist over whether the shale industry momentum can be sustained stateside, including issues related to servicing debt and attracting fresh investment. But price supportive action by OPEC and incremental interest from oil majors in viable shale plays suggests it is not all doom and gloom that some market commentators are predicting.', 'And it is worth pointing out the U.S. still imports large volumes of crude oil, especially heavy sour crude, given its refining complex, from exporters such as Brazil, Canada and Saudi Arabia to name a few. Nonetheless, the tectonic plates of the U.S. petroleum trade are shifting.', 'In 2018, the countrys petroleum trade deficit stood at $62 billion, or 10% of Washingtons trade balance, according to Rystad Energy. The Norway-based research and consulting outfit believes not only will a deficit this large be wiped out in 2020, but that a surplus could be achieved as early as February or March, and Washington could become energy independent on a monthly basis going forward.', 'If proven by the industry and survey data, that would be a remarkable reversal for a country which is currently the worlds largest crude consumer, and one that has been in a petroleum trade deficit since 1949.', 'nSource: Forbes']"

Nearly all of the forecast decrease is due to fewer emissions from coal consumption. Forecast natural gas CO2 emissions increase and petroleum CO2 emissions remain virtually unchanged.', 'Based on data in EIAs Monthly Energy Review, energy-related CO2 emissions in the first three months of 2019 were largely similar to those in the first three months of 2018. In the first quarter of 2019, EIA estimates that U.S. energy-related emissions totaled 1,367 million metric tons (MMmt), which is nearly equal to those in the first quarter of 2018.', 'The first quarter of the year is typically the period with the highest CO2 emissions in the United States, and therefore, heavily influences the overall annual trend. In the past 30 years, only 6 years have had an overall annual emissions trend that was different than that of the years first quarter. If EIAs emissions forecast is realized, 2019 will be the seventh such year, with overall emissions decreasing from 2018 values despite a first-quarter increase.', 'For the remainder of the year, EIA expects that relatively mild forecast temperatures will keep energy demand and resulting energy-related CO2 emissions below last years levels.

Conversely, EIA projects CO2 emissions from natural gas to increase by 53 MMmt. Both changes are largely due to forecast changes in the electricity generation mix as natural gas continues to grow as the most prevalent electricity generation fuel.', 'Because the electric power sector consumes nearly 92% of the coal used in the United States, expectations for both overall lower electricity demand and a lower share of coal-fired electricity this summer lead EIA to forecast lower coal CO2 emissions.', 'Although the electric power sector is using more natural gas, EIA does not expect the increase in natural gas emissions in 2019 to offset the decrease in coal emissions because natural gas-fired electricity generation is less carbon-intensive than coal-fired electricity generation.', 'EIA expects that CO2 emissions from petroleum consumption, which has risen in each of the past six years, will be virtually flat in 2019.

The new guidelines, dubbed IMO 2020, will limit the sulphur content of bunker fuel on ships to just 0.5 per cent, down from the current 3.5 per cent.', 'The deadline has been in place for years, but the change is still expected to wallop prices for heavy oil containing high levels of sulphur, such as raw bitumen from the Alberta oilsands. Bitumen makes up about half of Canadas 4.6 million barrels per day of crude oil production.', 'The discount on Western Canadian Select bitumen blend crude prices versus North American benchmark West Texas Intermediate could almost double in January, said Alan Gelder, vice-president, refining, for consultancy Wood Mackenzie.', 'In October, weve got the WTI-WCS differential at about US$16 per barrel. And weve got that widening out to the high-$20s in January, he said in a recent interview from London.', 'He added the differential should moderate to about US$23 or $24 by the middle of 2020.', 'The price difference between WTI and WCS is a closely watched figure because it dictates oilsands profitability and royalties paid to the provincial government. When the differential widened to as much as US$52 a barrel at the end of 2018, a development blamed on pipeline capacity failing to keep up with oilsands growth, the Alberta government introduced production curtailments in a successful bid to narrow the spread. The production limits have since been reduced but not cancelled.', 'Analyst Phil Skolnick of Eight Capital says there was little evidence of a major jump in WCS differentials pricing for January crude oil trades that started in early December.', 'The impact of the new pollution rules is being softened by disruptions in the flow of competing heavy oil from Venezuela and Mexico into the U.S., as well as new petrochemical projects in Asia that need heavy oil as feedstock, he said.', 'Canada is benefiting because of Venezuela, Mexico. With that, combined with the pull from these new petrochemical plants that are consuming medium and heavy oil, its helping to offset the risks of IMO 2020, said Skolnick.', 'Companies that own refineries or oilsands upgraders are expected to benefit as the new standards will increase demand for refined low-sulphur fuels.', 'At its recent investor day, chief financial officer Dan Lyons of Calgary-based Imperial Oil Ltd. said it will offer four options for marine fuel customers at its Vancouver terminal  3.5 per cent sulphur, 0.5 per cent, 0.1 per cent and blends made to order.', 'An expansion at its Lloydminster Upgrader on the Alberta-Saskatchewan border will help Calgary-based Husky Energy Inc. benefit from IMO 2020 as its diesel output will jump to 10,000 bpd from 6,000 bpd, said spokeswoman Kim Guttormson.', 'The company also produces diesel at its Lima Refinery in Ohio, which has been reconfigured to use more heavy oil.', 'Saint John-based Irving Oil Ltd. produces VLSFO (very low sulphur fuel oil) and marine gas oil at its Whitegate refinery in Ireland and is offering IMO-compliant fuels in New Brunswick through its expanded bunker operations, said spokeswoman Candice MacLean in an email. It also offers marine fuel oil in St. Johns, N.L., and Halifax, she added.', 'Most of the five million barrels per day of bunker fuel currently burned on ships is derived from the crude residue that remains after more valuable fuels such as gasoline and diesel have been removed in a refinery.', 'Following combustion, the sulphur in the fuel becomes sulphur oxide, a pollutant that causes respiratory problems and lung disease as well as acid rain. IMO 2020 is expected to prevent 8.5 million tonnes per year of sulphur oxide from entering the atmosphere.', 'The IMO first began restricting emissions in 2005 and its limits on sulphur in bunker fuel have been progressively tightened. Four emission control areas in Europe and North America already have a 0.1 per cent limit.', 'About 3.5 million bpd of bunker fuels consumed in 2019 are considered high-sulphur fuel oil. That is expected to fall to about 1.3 million bpd in January, according to Wood Mackenzie, as most ships will switch to alternatives including VLSFO and marine gas oil.', 'About 15 per cent of ships will have added scrubbers by then to capture sulphur from their smokestacks and allow them to continue to burn high-sulphur crude.', 'Full compliance is not expected on Jan. 1. Some ships will be allowed to continue to burn high-sulphur fuel by citing safety concerns about switching to new fuel blends or because their scrubbers havent arrived yet.', 'Refiners are expected to be able to deliver about 1.4 million bpd of VLSFO in 2020, while demand for marine gas oil, a refined product similar to diesel, is expected to jump to about one million bpd in 2020 and gradually grow to about 2.4 million bpd.', 'The new fuel standard could eventually boost demand for liquefied natural gas, with Wood Mackenzie forecasting 22 million tonnes per year of LNG demand from shipping by 2030.', 'The high cost of switching to LNG means it will likely only be installed on new ships, said Gelder.', 'Not everyone is satisfied with the higher standards under IMO 2020.', 'Environmental groups including Stand.earth have called on the cruise and shipping industries to ban the use of scrubbers as they allow the continued burning of high-sulphur fuels.', 'They also call LNG a false solution that wont help the industry reduce its greenhouse gas emissions.', 'This report by The Canadian Press was first published Dec. 28, 2019.', 'nSource: Financial Post']"

Exxon Mobil counts Guyana as a significant source of future low-cost production and aims to ramp up production at the Stabroek field to 750,000 barrels a day by 2025.', 'Neither Brazil nor Guyana is a flash in the pan producer. Real money is being invested in bringing these massive offshore reserves  where breakeven costs are resilient and typically below $40 a barrel  to the market over the coming decade.

But the gradual easing of Albertas curtailment policy, which has raised local oil prices for Canadian producers sufficiently, means more barrels will spill onto the market in the near-term, as well.', 'None of this is good news for the OPEC cartel, stuck as it is in a neverending cycle of production cuts.

But oil markets still look oversupplied in 2020, and shale is no longer the lone culprit. Its hard to see a sustained rally in oil prices at the moment.', 'No producer benefits from low oil prices, including U.S. energy companies. But OPECs actions in recent years suggest the cartel and its petro-state members need higher prices more than their non-OPEC brethren.

Due to Saudi Arabias adherence to oil production cuts as part of the Opec+ agreement, that will kick in January till end of March, it is forecasting oil revenue to decline 14.8% to Riyals 513 billion in 2020 from 2019.', 'We were urging the government to control spending going forward, so I think this [2020] budget has moved in the direction we had hoped and recommended, said Callen. But, of course, there is still the challenge of delivery on the budget and certainly the spending path is ambitious. I think its achievable but will need strong implementation of policy to achieve that going forward.', 'OPEC+', 'nThe Opec/non-Opec alliance, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, agreed earlier in December to deepen their oil cuts to 1.7 million b/d from the current 1.2 million b/d until the end of March amid concern of oversupply in the first quarter of next year.', 'The deal includes a surprise additional voluntary cut of 400,000 b/d by Saudi Arabia, which means the alliance will trim its production by 2.1 million b/d through to March.', 'Callen said the impact of the agreement on the Saudi economy will be determined by the course of events after the end of March.', 'At this stage, we will have to see what the production decision is for the rest of the year, he said.', 'Nonetheless, the IMF expects non-oil growth to fuel the economy in 2020 despite a drop in government spending, which had been the main catalyst for growth in previous years.', 'On the non-oil side, growth seems to be evolving pretty much as we expected, said Callen. Confidence in the economy seems to be better now than a few years ago and we would expect private sector momentum to be there even if government spending slows.', 'Economic growth forecasts for Saudi Arabia will be revised in January as part of the IMFs World Economic Outlook Update, he added. Saudi economic growth for 2020 is forecast to reach 2.2% in 2020, according to the IMFs October regional report.', 'VISION 2030', 'nSaudi Arabia wants to wean itself off oil income to propel private sector growth and has adopted Vision 2030, a roadmap for incentivizing non-oil growth.', 'Vision 2030, the brainchild of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman that was revealed in 2016, envisages everything from increasing the number of tourists to boosting private sector contribution to the GDP.', 'Callen said implementation of the Vision continues to progress, but priorities need to be established to ensure its success.', 'One of the messages we have consistently given is the importance to prioritize the reforms. It is hard to do everything in one go, said Callen.', 'According to Callen, there are three priorities for the government: First is to eliminate the fiscal deficit, second is to continue to improve the business environment and attractiveness of country to domestic and foreign investors, and thirdly, to implement reforms that will encourage young Saudis to work in the private sector.', 'ARAMCO IPO', 'nSelling a stake in Saudi Aramco, the worlds biggest oil producing company, is part of that vision and proceeds from the 1.5% domestic stake sale that took place in December in the worlds biggest initial public offering is expected to be funneled back into the local economy.', 'The Public Investment Fund, the country sovereign wealth fund, is expected to invest the proceeds of the IPO, which raised $25.6 billion beating the previous record held by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibabas $25 billion flotation in 2014.', 'Money that is being raised by the IPO clearly gives the authorities opportunities for investing either domestically to help develop some of the sectors there they are looking to develop as part of Vision 2030 initiatives or internationally in assets to provide a return and revenues for the government, said Callen.', 'nSource:xa0', 'nttttttttttntttttnttttttttt']"

    "title": "New Decade, Same Risks For Oil And Gas Markets",
    "content": "['As the year comes to a close, its a fitting time to review recent developments that inform our future expectations for the  global oil and gas industry.', 'The past decade once again reminded the world of the immense price volatility of fossil fuels. The boom and bust is driven by the investment cycle affecting supply, and demand caused by the economic growth.', 'The oil price boom of 2011-2014 was followed by a sobering crash of mid-2014-2017. Brent price halved within four months, going down from $115.00 per barrel in September 2014 to $27.67 January 2015.    ', 'The global demand for fuels has grown since then. Key industry players have learned from past experience and adopted better strategies to cope with the market volatility. Nonetheless, the oil and gas sector remains highly uncertain and sensitive to the global geopolitical trends, and security, from Abqaiq to Venezuela.', '2019 was an incredible testament to that. This September, when the ongoing Iranian-Saudi rivalry, including the internationalized civil war in Yemen, had resulted in an attack on the Saudi Aramcos critical oil production facilities, the world saw the greatest single disruption of global oil supply since the Gulf War of 1991. Nevertheless, the abundance of oil in the markets, less than stellar economic performance, and the sale of some oil futures contracts have prevented panic and allowed the markets to move on with a minimal disruption.', 'Today, the U.S.-led sanctions on Iran and the steady decrease in Venezuelan oil production have contributed to concerns over global energy security, while a global economic slow-down dampened the demand. The global oil supply remains solid, in a price band that favors economic growth.', 'Meanwhile, the market also recalibrated the regional outlook of the major fuels suppliers. OECD countries increased their liquids supply by 1.54 million barrels per day from the 2018 average mostly thanks to the United States that recently became a net petroleum exporter.', 'With 90,000 bpd more total oil and liquid fuel products sold than purchased in September, the United States had become a net exporter for the first time since the records started running in 1949. The U.S. Energy and Information Administration predicts the net exports to continue exceeding net imports by an average of at least 80,000 bpd in 2020. The U.S. crude oil production will continue its impressive growth up to 13,2 million bpd, compared to 12,3 million bpd in 2019. ', 'Needless to say, the increase in the U.S. production of fossil fuels allowed it to shift the long-standing distribution of the energy market share in Europe. With Iran and, to an extent, Russia being discouraged from exporting hydrocarbons by sanctions, the United States has is aspiring to significantly expand its energy exports, both oil and gas. For European countries, this presents a great opportunity to mitigate their decades-long dependency on undesirable and unstable suppliers, thereby boosting energy security in the region.', 'U.S. liquified natural gas (LNG) has challenged Russias dominance in Europe this year. While Moscow looks to launch the Nord Stream 2 in 2020, a pipeline that would double its gas export capacity to Germany to 110 billion cubic meters (bcm) per year, the increasing presence of the U.S. as an alternative supplier may make Russia uncomfortable, and put a downward pressure on prices to the benefit of European consumers. America is now the second largest LNG supplier to Europe after Qatar, and has seen shipments rise by 181% between July 2018 and March 2019.', 'Although U.S. natural gas production is expected to continue to rise, it will grow at a slower rate in the first six months of 2020 in response to lower prices in the third quarter of 2019, averaging 95.1 bcf per day. Notwithstanding the structural changes associated with the U.S. LNG boom, Henry Hub natural gas prices will most likely go down from $2.59 in 2019 to an average of $2.42-2.45 MMBtu in 2020.', 'The fact that at these low prices the gas production industry is still profitable and growing pays tribute to American technological prowess. With some of the stranded gas reaching US markets as pipelines being completed, may further dampen prices.', 'In regard to oil prices, two major recent developments will influence the market trends of 2020. First, the OPEC-plus members have agreed to lower their oil production by additional 500,000 bpd, rounding up to 1.7 million bpd cut from the baseline of October 2018. In view of increasing oil inventories, OPEC-plus is expected to extend the output cut beyond the upcoming March  most  probably till the end of 2020.', 'Second, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) is looking to enact a new bunker-fuel regulation starting January 1 that will require to use low-sulfur fuel oil for maritime shipping. This is done to diminish SOx and CO2 emissions, and will result in redirection of high-sulfur fuel oil into power generation and generate additional short-term demand for compliant bunker-fuel.', 'In view of these factors, oil prices should rise, potentially scoring above $65 per barrel for Brent oil in the first half of the next year as the industry responds to the structural demand changes, and then go down to average $61 per barrel for 2020, compared to $64 for 2019. WTI price is expected to reach $55 per barrel.', 'While these forecasts are informed by the global economic and geopolitical situation at this point, there are other important factors that exacerbate the uncertainty and volatility of the fossil fuels markets. In the context of the generally slowing economic growth worldwide, such ongoing political and security factors as the U.S.-China trade tensions, the November 2020 U.S. presidential election, handling of Brexit by the newly elected Tory Cabinet, as well as regional conflicts among and within countries in the Middle East could still bear unanticipated consequences for the oil and gas industry.', 'nSource: Forbes']"

Low oil prices helped trigger the Arab Spring uprisings, which started as bread riots in Tunisia before Chinas economic stimulus helped catapult the value above $120/b.', 'Then as now the oil industry was criticized for its environmental impact following BPs Deepwater Horizon blowout, which resulted in almost 5 million barrels of crude spilling into the Gulf of Mexico.', 'At the dawn of a new decade, many of the challenges facing the oil market look very similar to those in the last. Global warming could force producers to keep oil in the ground unless new carbon-capture technologies can be developed to remove emissions from the atmosphere, or draconian measures are taken to sharply cut consumption.', 'As we enter a new decade, the energy complex feels like it is all cascading towards a race to the bottom, wrote S&P Global Platts Analytics in a research note. All energy commodities are competing fora share of finite downstream demand, whether it be in industry, refining, power generation, or petrochemicals. At the same time, continued growth in renewables, efficiency gains, and increased penetration of EVs [Electric Vehicles] and hydrogen will limit the overall call on fossil fuels.', 'The growth of EVs could start to eat into demand for fossil fuels in passenger transport by 2030, according to some forecasts. Meanwhile, changes to reduce the levels of sulfur in marine fuels coming into force in 2020 will help to clean up the worlds shipping lanes and transform a sector, which accounts for about a 5.5 million b/d of oil demand, according to Platts Analytics.', 'nSUPPORTING PRICES', 'In the Middle East  where about a fifth of the worlds oil originates  the political environment looks evermore unstable heading into the new decade. Attacks on critical infrastructure in Saudi Arabia and tankers anchored near the Strait of Hormuz throughout 2019 have highlighted the ongoing risks to the worlds most important supply basin.

Holding together its OPEC+ pact beyond 2020 will be vital for the cartels future throughout the decade.', 'US oil production is likely to continue to shape world markets. America is now producing more crude than Saudi Arabia but its success could ultimately be its undoing. Lower oil prices caused partly by the shale revolution have started to hit the prolific Permian Basin, where rig counts have fallen and operators have cut spending. But Platts Analytics still expects the US to record the biggest gains next year, with supply expected to grow by 1.3 million b/d.', 'This will place domestic production above domestic consumption for the first time in decades, but the US will still be an importer of crude oil in 2020 with exports of shale jumping 1.5 million b/d. Sanctions on Iran and Venezuela will hold throughout the year, while Saudi Arabia will lead the rest of OPEC+ to greater supply restraint (and the fourth year in a row of OPEC declines) in its last great opportunity to support prices, said Platts Analytics.', 'Avoiding a repeat of the worst economic recession since the 1930s will also be vital for oil demand over the next 10 years. Chinas trade dispute with the US  the worlds top consumers of crude  has dragged on oil prices throughout 2019.

Refiners are attributing this to a slowdown in fuel demand.', 'Under regulations issued in October 2016 by IMO, the marine sector must reduce sulphur emissions by 80% by switching to lower sulphur fuels. Sulphur content in marine fuels will have to be reduced to 0.5% from the present 3.5%. Higher sulphur content in fuel is a major contributor to air pollution.', 'There are essentially two ways to do this: one, to clean up fuel oil by installing scrubbersalso known as marine exhaust equipment. But Indian refiners do not produce much fuel oil. The other alternative to high sulphur fuel oil is diesel, the Indian refiners preferred option, and the reason they anticipated an increase in diesel demand.', 'High-speed diesel of the kind produced by Indian refiners have reduced level of sulphur as necessitated by the Bharat Stage emission standards. Hence, the new IMO rule was expected to boost the gross refining margins of refiners such as Reliance Industries, Nayara Energy, Indian Oil Corp. Ltd, Bharat Petroleum Corp. Ltd and Hindustan Petroleum Corp. Ltd. But in the absence of a global recovery in oil demand, analysts anticipate that gross refining margins would remain suppressed for a few more months. Anticipating higher diesel demand post mandatory implementation of the new IMO norms on 1 January, refineries across the world added capacity. Demand, however, has not kept pace.', 'Higher demand was expected to improve diesels crack spreadthe difference between the price of crude oil and petroleum products extracted from itto as high as $20-30 a barrel by FY21.', 'Consumption of diesel as a marine fuel is expected to increase from 0.75mnbpd (million barrels per day) to 3.3mnbpd in 2020. This would result in additional demand of 2.6mnbpd of diesel. Since refineries may not be able to meet this incremental demand due to limited refining capacity, it may lead to a spike in diesel margins racks, ultimately improving overall refining margins.', 'Since we dont make fuel oil, we are in an advantageous position. We get the benefit of IMO if the gasoil (petrol) prices go up; then you expect better economics which everyone expected for gasoil cracks to be substantially higher, said B. Anand, CEO, Nayara Energy.', 'Fuel oil, also called furnace oil, is another by-product of crude oil distillation. It is used in ships, power plants and other industrial plants.

Some developers have stopped talking about FID altogether.', 'US LNG project developers tout various advantages in their effort to stand out in a crowded field, from low costs to innovative pricing models and equity investment partnerships. But complications in short-term contracting as a result of market volatility and trade uncertainty can deter buyers from entering supply agreements with US projects, favoring projects that are backed by majors and capitalized.', 'GLOBAL TRENDS', 'nGlobally, a series of major LNG projects took a different approach in recent years that saw deep-pocketed project sponsors take FID without firm offtake agreements. That has given projects in Canada, Russia and elsewhere a speed-to-market advantage The only US project to take that route, so far, has been Golden Pass LNG in Texas, which is backed by ExxonMobil and Qatar Petroleum.', 'Amid the contracting challenges in the US, some established players are moving forward with additional liquefaction trains with less offtake sold upfront than for earlier trains. That was the case when Cheniere Energy greenlighted a sixth train at its Sabine Pass facility in Louisiana in June.', 'The trend could make it more difficult for the market to forecast which new US projects make it to the finish line and which ones do not.', 'If there is going to be a bright spot next year, its going to be a bow getting tied on projects that were getting close to the goal line this year, Webber said.

It is the time of year for taking stock and looking to the future, and in that spirit, I have collected a selection of predictions for 2020 from 10 WoodMac experts.', 'A slowdown in US Lower 48 oil production growth will help OPEC', 'nWe are forecasting persistent global oversupply to continue in 2020, with non-OPEC production to increase 2.3 million barrels per day (b/d) year-on-year. For the first time in four years, though, the US will contribute less than half of that non-OPEC gain, as new producers such as Guyana ramp up and US shale growth slows.', 'Wood Mackenzie forecasts total US liquids production to rise by 1 million b/d in 2020, less than half the increase in 2018, when output rose by an astounding 2.4 million b/d. As the industry moves beyond the sweetest spots for drilling, and investors choke back the flow of capital to E&Ps, US Lower 48 onshore crude and condensate production is expected to gain just 0.5 million b/d in 2020. Having put pressure on other oil-producing countries for years, US investors will indirectly help them in 2020, supporting the OPEC+ groups attempt to tackle global oversupply by restraining its output. With OPEC+ production restraint and stable demand growth, additional downward pressure on crude prices can be avoided in 2020.', 'Ann-Louise Hittle, Head of Macro Oils', 'Investors will reward US E&Ps who sharpen their focus on dividends and debt reduction', 'nThe immense pressure tight oil players are under to generate free cash will not go away in 2020, and could well persist into 2021 and 2022. Dropping rigs is one of the fastest ways to generate cash, but since the commodity downturn of 2009, very few shale E&Ps have pursued a successful shrink to grow strategy. Now may be the time to revisit that. Some Marcellus producers have tested the waters before releasing firm 2020 budgets, and their messages have been well received. If tight oil E&Ps are brave enough to tell investors theyll forfeit any production growth to concentrate on delivering cash flow and raising dividends instead, we believe this market is likely to reward them.', 'Robert Clarke, Research Director Lower 48 Upstream', 'Company share prices will begin to reflect differences in perceived climate risk', 'nPressure on companies to disclose climate-related risks, including emissions metrics and the potential impacts to their businesses under a 2C scenario, will increase. In 2020 they will release the first round of annual results since the EUs guidelines on reporting climate-related information were published in July 2019, and the EU Regulation on Disclosures relating to sustainable investments and sustainability risks came into force. That EU regulation makes it mandatory for financial market participants to disclose how they incorporate sustainability risks into their investment decisions and products, and how they measure alignment with sustainability targets. To provide those disclosures, financial market participants will require greater disclosure around sustainability risks, including climate risk, from companies in their portfolios. In the US, companies will also face increased scrutiny as the issue rises up the political agenda, as a result of the presidential election and debates over the proposed Climate Risk Disclosure Act, introduced in the Senate by Elizabeth Warren.', 'Amy Bowe, Director of Upstream Consulting', 'Sustainability will permeate all business segments', 'nBuilding resilience in the face of energy transition across all business segments will be one of 2020s key themes. Shifting portfolios to the lower end of the cost curve, capital discipline and shareholder returns will remain high on the list of strategic priorities. Value will be favoured over volume. Digitalisation and technology will dominate the resource renewal discussion, making explorers even more uncomfortable. Eyes will be on Repsol, as it reveals what it means to align its exploration portfolio with the Paris climate goals. The EUs Green Deal will prompt a few strategic reviews across the sector, with BP the one to watch.', 'Valentina Kretzschmar, Director of Corporate Research', 'International oil companies will keep selling assets', 'nThe process of re-engineering upstream portfolios for resilience will continue in 2020. Portfolio rationalisation will be a key tool, fuelled by a supermajor sell-off. But dont expect a big rebound in upstream M&A from 2019s lows. The supply of assets will outstrip demand. Sellers will need to accept discounted prices to shift low-margin, carbon-intensive assets from their portfolios.', 'Tom Ellacott, Senior Vice-President, Corporate Research', 'Solar power will continue to prosper in major markets in spite of subsidy cuts, while new markets will emerge', 'n2020 will mark the beginning of reduced investment tax credits in the US, while China, the worlds largest solar market, moves toward a subsidy-free solar market structure. It will be the first time in a long time that the number one and two solar markets will have embarked on major policy shifts. Even so, we expect we expect 126 gigawatts (GW) of capacity to be installed in 2020, beating the current record of 105 GW achieved in 2019. India, the third-largest market, will continue to see more low-priced utility-scale projects come online, even as the longer-term view remains tepid due to excessively competitive solar tenders. The long tail of solar markets will also grow at a faster clip, with 22 country markets having at least 500 megawatts of annual installations, up from 17 in 2019 and 16 the year before. For the longer-term, there could be several bright spots, including the new solar homes mandate in California that goes into effect on January 1, and the initiation of Chinas 14th Five-Year Plan.', 'Ravi Manghani, Head of Solar', 'All eyes will be on China as uncertainties mount', 'nIts difficult to recall heading into a new year with quite so much uncertainty over Chinas economy. With stimulus options much more restricted than in the past, the countrys economic planners have just called for a contingency plan to deal with slowing growth. Last weeks phase one trade agreement with the US may have garnered headlines, but delivered very little of substance. All of this matters. China is the biggest market for seaborne commodities, and economic uncertainty coupled with Beijings double down on raising domestic coal, oil and gas output in 2020 will have major implications for commodity price volatility over the coming 12 months.', 'Gavin Thompson, Vice-Chair Asia-Pacific', 'Commodity prices will converge in Asia', 'nEnergy transition drives inter-fuel substitution. Japans gas-fired capacity is under-utilised because gas prices have traditionally been higher than coal, so coal-to-gas switching didnt generally make sense. But things are changing. Japanese utilities are looking to curb emissions and keen to increase gas plant utilisation to help them integrate renewable power supplies and reduce local air pollution. Meanwhile, liquefied natural gas (LNG) suppliers are looking to secure demand with innovative pricing models in an oversupplied market. In April 2019, Tokyo Gas announced a 10-year agreement with Shell Eastern Trading for supply of 0.5 million tonnes per annum of LNG from 2020. The contract price is said to include coal indexation. We understand this is the first such LNG contract for supply to Japan. The new pricing mechanism improves LNG competitiveness in the power sector, and the trend is set to pick up in Asia next year.', 'Prakash Sharma, Head of Markets & Transitions, Asia-Pacific', 'Companies and investors will wake up to the fact that energy transition starts and ends with metals', 'nMuch is being made of the energy transition and how companies and countries are adapting their strategies to be at the forefront of the shift to a lower-carbon world. The missing piece of the jigsaw is the fact that energy transition cannot and will not happen without the appropriate and timely development of the supply of metals. In 2020, the penny will drop that it isnt just about lithium and cobalt needed to feed the electric vehicle revolution, but its more about the aluminium, copper, lead, zinc and nickel that will be needed to generate, transmit and store low- or zero-carbon power. 2020 is set to be the back to the future year, with energy companies looking at opportunities to invest in the raw material supply chain to ensure security of supply. Without appropriate support from either government agencies or deep-pocketed energy companies, metals may become the disabler of the energy transition as a lack of investment will limit the ability of the world to decarbonise. As the philosopher George Santayana said: Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.', 'Julian Kettle, Vice-Chairman, Metals & Mining', 'Global carbon emissions are likely to rise again', 'nGlobal greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise. To stay on track for limiting the rise in global temperatures to 2C, emissions need to shift into a lower gear  contracting in some markets, fuels, and sectors  within the next 12 months. The problem is well understood, but responses are not: just look at the range of opinion post-COP 25 in Madrid. The shift to zero-carbon technologies  in terms of corporate strategy, capital investment, and human capital deployment  has progressed at a fast clip in 2019.This pace of change will not slow down in the year ahead. But global carbon emissions are still thought to have risen this year. How quickly society can respond to the global climate challenge will be reflected in 2020 emission data; the bellwether for progress.', 'David Brown, Head of Markets & Transitions, Americas', 'And finally, one from me:', 'The 2020 presidential election will be momentous for US energy', 'nPresident Donald Trumps election victory in 2016 has arguably not had a particularly large impact on the US energy industry.', 'Trends in oil and gas production that developed while Barack Obama was in office have continued, and the Trump administration has made little progress on his signature pledge to put the miners back to work in the coal industry.', 'The 2020 election may be different. A second Trump term will mean continuity, with further deregulation for the oil, gas and coal industries, and possibly another attempt to prop up economically challenged coal-fired power plants.', 'A Democratic president is likely to attempt to be more interventionist than Obama in pursuit of climate goals. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have said they would ban fracking. Sanders has repeatedly said that fossil fuel executives should be criminally prosecuted for the destruction they have knowingly caused. Michael Bloomberg, a late entrant into the race to be the Democratic candidate, has set out a climate policy that includes a plan to close every coal-fired power plant in the US by 2030. Joe Biden, currently leading in the polls for the nomination, wants $500 billion a year invested in clean energy and environmental improvements, one-third of that from federal spending.', 'The reality is likely to fall short of the rhetoric, especially if a Democratic president faces a Republican-controlled Senate, but the campaign pledges point clearly to the direction of travel. A change of administration in 2021 would usher in one of the most significant shifts in energy strategy in US history.', 'Ed Crooks, Vice-Chair, Americas', 'nQuote of the year', 'nI am disappointed with the results of #COP25. The international community lost an important opportunity to show increased ambition on mitigation, adaptation and finance to tackle the climate crisis. But we must not give up, and I will not give up.  Antnio Guterres, secretary-general of the UN, reflected on the failure of the COP25 climate talks in Madrid, which ended on Sunday. The lack of progress at the meeting puts even more pressure on COP26, which will be held next November in Glasgow.', 'Chart of the year', 'nThis is a version of a picture that I and WoodMac colleagues have been showing a lot this year. Its purpose is to emphasise the scale of the challenge involved in achieving the Paris climate agreements goal of keeping the rise in global temperatures to well below 2C.', 'The highest line is the expected trajectory for global greenhouse gas emissions in our base-case forecast, with a plateau in the late 2020s. The second line down is the carbon constrained scenario, also known as the accelerated energy transition scenario. This essentially shows climate policies being pushed as far and as fast as is technically and politically possible. It shows a clear decline in emissions to 2040, but not enough to put the world on course for the Paris goal.', 'To do that, the path of emissions would have to be bent down to something like the lower line, which tracks the IEAs sustainable development scenario. The gaps between the top and bottom lines are a measure of how much additional effort would be needed to put us on track for a 2C world. It is a daunting prospect.', 'Coming next', 'nThis is the last Energy Pulse of 2019.

Ten years later, a half-dozen US LNG export facilities have sent out more than 3 Tcf of liquefied gas to dozens of countries.

That activity crested in 2018 after an unfavorable tax ruling from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which prompted Williams and Enbridge to roll up their MLPs while other midstream partnerships elected to merge with their general partners and/or convert to C-corps.', 'Today, according to data compiled by CBREs Howard, there are 30 midstream partnerships compared with the 34 that existed at the end of 2009.

The growth was the largest annual increase in production on record, reaching a record high for the second consecutive year. U.S. natural gas production measured as gross withdrawals averaged 101.3 Bcf/d in 2018, the highest volume on record, according to EIAs Monthly Crude Oil, Lease Condensate, and Natural Gas Production Report. U.S. natural gas production measured as marketed production and dry natural gas production also reached record highs at 89.6 Bcf/d and 83.4 Bcf/d, respectively.', 'U.S. natural gas gross withdrawals increased every month during 2018 except in June, ultimately reaching a record monthly high of 107.8 Bcf/d in December 2018. Marketed natural gas production and dry natural gas production also hit monthly record highs of 95.0 Bcf/d and 88.6 Bcf/d, respectively, in December 2018. Marketed production reflects gross withdrawals less natural gas used for repressuring wells, quantities vented or flared, and nonhydrocarbon gases removed in treating or processing operations. Dry natural gas is consumer-grade natural gas, or marketed production less extraction losses.', 'As natural gas production increased, the volume of natural gas exportsboth through pipelines and as liquefied natural gas (LNG)increased for the fourth consecutive year, reaching 9.9 Bcf/d. Total natural gas exports grew 14% in 2018, and LNG exports grew by 53% to 3.0 Bcf/d. Both pipeline and LNG exports reached record monthly highs in December 2018 of 7.7 Bcf/d and 4.0 Bcf/d, respectively. The United States continued to export more natural gas than it imported in 2018, after being a net exporter in 2017 for the first time in nearly 60 years.', 'In September 2018, the United States exported more natural gas by pipeline than it imported by pipeline for the first time in at least 20 years. Forecasts in EIAs Short-Term Energy Outlook show that natural gas exports by pipeline will exceed natural gas imports by pipeline in 2019 for the year.', 'The Appalachian region remained the largest natural gas-producing region in the United States. Appalachian natural gas from the Marcellus and Utica/Point Pleasant shales of Ohio, West Virginia, and Pennsylvania continued to grow, with gross withdrawals increasing from 24.2 Bcf/d in 2017 to 28.5 Bcf/d in 2018. Ohio saw the largest percentage increase in gross withdrawals of natural gas, up 34%, in 2018 to 6.5 Bcf/d.', 'Texas saw the largest total volumetric gain in gross withdrawals in 2018, increasing to 24.1 Bcf/d, up from the states 2017 production of 21.9 Bcf/d. Texass increase in natural gas production is mainly because of the development in the Permian Basin and Haynesville Shale formation. According to EIAs Drilling Productivity Report, in 2018, production in the Permian increased by 2.7 Bcf/d, or 32%, while production in the Haynesville increased by 2.2 Bcf/d, or 34%.', 'nSource: EIA']"

    "content": "['As production from the US Northeast stalls and the active rig count declines in the region, the market could tighten significantly and help propel Henry Hub futures later this winter.', 'The prompt month Henry Hub contract has tumbled more than 55 cents since early November and is currently hovering around $2.30/MMBtu. While weather has been largely unsupportive of US balances, flagging production, namely in the Northeast, and robust utilization of LNG facilities presents downside risk to end-of-winter storage levels, which S&P Global Platts Analytics currently has forecast at 2 Tcf at the end of March.', 'US production has averaged 91.8 Bcf/d month to date but dipped as low as 90.8 Bcf/d in recent days. This contrasts with Platts Analytics previous forecast of 92.9 Bcf/d for the balance of winter, a level just reached last month. The Northeast is driving the production decline due to the large decline in rigs and typical seasonal production profile that exhibits a strong end of year run-up before moderating at the start of January.', 'After peaking at 34 Bcf/d in mid-November, regional production has tumbled more than 1 Bcf/d, dipping as low as 32.4 Bcf/d on Monday, with declines spread across Northeast Pennsylvania, South Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Platts Analytics forecast for Northeast production for the balance of winter (33.3 Bcf/d) sits about 0.9 Bcf/d above recent postings.', 'The current Northeast rig count, 49 as of Friday, is at a level sufficient to keep production flat through 2020, but additional rig declines could result in significant production declines in the region. Active rigs in the US Northeast one year ago totaled 77, according to data from Enverus.', 'Should an additional 20% of rigs be lost by March 2020, Platts Analytics finds Northeast production would average just 32.6 Bcf/d for the 2020 calendar year. At 33.2 Bcf/d month to date, a 20% cut to the rig fleet would see Northeast production fall to 31.6 Bcf/d by December 2020.', 'Also, LNG feedgas demand is exceeding Platts Analytics forecast for the balance of winter, further tightening balances. Total US feedgas deliveries reached a new all-time high of 8.51 Bcf/d on Friday, with the recent surge driven by higher flows to Cameron and Sabine Pass.', 'Deliveries to Cameron reached a new high of 0.8 Bcf/d as commissioning activities ramp up for the facilitys second train. Train 2 is scheduled to enter commercial service in April 2020. In addition to Cameron, deliveries to Sabine Pass strengthened back above 4.2 Bcf/d. US LNG feedgas is well on its way to another record-breaking monthly average with the current December average at 7.95 Bcf/d.', 'Taken together, if US production holds near 91 Bcf/d for the balance of winter, which is not out of the question given recent Northeast production readings and stalling drilling activity, there would be roughly 2 Bcf/d (or about 200 Bcf) of downside risk to end-of-March storage levels in the US.', 'Stocks could finish the winter about 200 to 250 Bcf below Platts Analytics current forecast, leaving inventories around 1.7 Tcf exiting the winter. The tightness would likely extend into summer and present an upside risk to Henry Hub prices, especially if rig declines continue in the Northeast.', 'nSource: ', 'nttttttttttntttttnttttttttt']"

    "title": "Why oil refining is a critical part of the energy industry",
    "content": "['It does not have the glamour of wildcatting in distant frontiers, nor the customer visibility of petrol stations, but oil refining is a critical part of the industry. It turns the gloopy black crude oil into the carefully tailored products, from petrol, diesel and jet fuel, to lubricants and feedstocks. A key part of Middle Eastern investment plans, refining is entering a more complex and pressured decade.', 'Instead of exporting raw materials, refining has traditionally been seen as a way for oil producers to add value to their product. Refining margins also tend to outperform when oil prices drop. More recently, Middle Eastern states, notably Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Kuwait, have sought to guarantee offtake by investing in mega-refineries in their key emerging Asian markets, China, India, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia and others. And they have added petrochemical complexes to generate higher-value and more sophisticated outputs.', 'Still, refining faces three major challenges. First is overcapacity. World oil demand is expected to rise about 1-1.1 million barrels per day during this year, and 1.3 million bpd in 2020. But a wave of new refineries will increase capacity by 1.8 million bpd and more than 2.2 million bpd respectively. By 2021 it will be a little slower (and some of the planned 2020 refineries may slip into the year after), but 2022 is another strong year with 1.8 million bpd expected.', 'This gain comes mostly from giant new refineries in China, the Middle East and one big plant in Nigeria built by tycoon Aliko Dangote. Adnoc plans to create the worlds largest refining and petrochemical complex at Ruwais, adding a new 600,000 bpd refinery around 2024. Kuwait is upgrading two refineries to produce cleaner fuels, and building a third giant greenfield facility, while Oman is constructing a big refinery with Kuwaiti investment at its south-eastern port of Duqm. There are smaller projects in the UAE at Enocs Jebel Ali refinery and Brooges Fujairah oil storage terminal. Iran and Iraq also have a range of refining projects of varying sizes and realism.', 'If refining capacity is in surplus, some will have to run below maximum rates, and even shut down. This is most likely in Europe and Japan, where both oil demand and production have been dropping for years, energy costs and wages are high and imported crude more costly. However, closing refineries is difficult  they have serious environmental legacies, local politicians tend to resist large layoffs of workers, and governments prefer self-sufficiency in refining to assure a secure supply of fuels.', 'Meanwhile, plants in the Middle East, developing Asia and North America are more competitive, being large and modern and having easy access to feedstock. Surplus Chinese products are exported to Asian neighbours, but they want to retain their own refineries to avoid dependence on Beijing.', 'The second challenge is the possible peak in demand for oil. Improved vehicle efficiency, tighter environmental standards, a slowing Chinese economy, replacement of oil by natural gas, and the rise of electric vehicles, can combine to drive oil consumption into permanent and inexorable decline. When this will happen is a matter of debate, with estimates ranging anywhere from the mid-2020s to the mid-2040s or beyond. But for refinery investments predicated on a payback of more than a decade, and decades more of useful life after that, the prospect is worrying.', 'The situation is worse than it sounds, because a growing share of final oil demand is not derived from crude oil. It comes from natural gas liquids, a by-product of gas production that is booming particularly in the US; from biofuels made from crops and plant waste; and from synthetic fuels derived from coal in China. So the peak of refining runs will come before a peak in overall oil consumption.', 'To cope with this prospect, new refineries are typically integrated with petrochemicals production. This brings cost-saving synergies, and adds value and diversity of outputs. While road fuel demand is expected to go into decline in the foreseeable future, demand for petrochemicals  producing plastics, rubber, paint, glue, fibres and a host of other products  is anticipated to keep rising. In developing countries, it grows faster than the economy.', 'Petrochemicals are therefore seen as a hedge against peak demand. New Chinese plants are usually designed for a high output of petrochemicals. Saudi Aramco plans a $20 billion (Dh73bn), 400,000 bpd plant at Yanbu to turn crude oil directly into chemicals without going through a refining step, though this may be rethought following its acquisition of compatriot Saudi Arabia Basic Industries Corporation.', 'The third concern for refiners is tightening environmental standards. On January 1, 2020, new regulations reducing the allowable amount of sulphur in shipping fuel go into force. This is bad news for simple refineries with a high output of sulphurous fuel oil. It will be favourable, though, for complex plants that can desulphurise crude.', 'In the longer term, measures will be taken intended to clean up the oceans, which may dampen petrochemical growth. There will be more emphasis on recycling and using biomaterials as inputs. And refineries greenhouse gas emissions will come into focus as climate change policies tighten. Refiners will have to keep improving energy efficiency, incorporate renewable energy, and install systems to capture their carbon dioxide.', 'Building refining capacity at home and abroad is a key part of most Middle Eastern states energy strategies. As the industrys challenges grow, they will have to be disciplined, innovative and highly efficient to make a success of these investments.', 'nSource: The National ']"

', 'In other words: the jig is up. ', 'Reading the writing on the wall', 'One by one, they have yielded. ', 'After three painful years of economic stagnation, Angola recently slashed headline tax rates on smaller oil fields from 20% to 10%, while its state-owned energy giant, Sonangol, is selling off non-core assets. Little wonder: since the oil price crash of 2014, companies have scoffed at the large upfront costs Angola demanded in exchange for fresh capital spending on the large offshore rigs required to dredge oil from beneath the ocean there. ', 'In Algeria, where years have passed with scant new oil investment and the economy has sagged, the lower house of parliament last month passed a measure that would reduce taxes on oil and gas extraction. The bill still faces passage in the upper chamber, but experts say that lowering taxes is critical if the country wants to revive its oil sector. (As in Angola, oil revenue provides more than 90% of Algerias foreign exchange earnings.) ', 'Both OPEC members may well be trying to replicate the success of a third. In July Gabon lowered taxes and relaxed state ownership over the oil sector, part of an overhaul of its hydrocarbons code. It was a gusher: Gabon recently signed several new contracts with oil producing firms, including Houston-based Vaalco and Malaysias state-owned group Petronas. ', 'The trio of OPEC nations isnt alone. In India and Indonesia, reforms to meant to entice investors are underway. In licensing rounds that the UK held in 2017, new types of licenses with flexible terms were on offer. ', 'Others could soon follow in their footsteps. In October, Russias energy minister said that unless Russia lowered taxes it would soon become uncompetitive with oil producing countries such as the United States, where oil-rich shale fields have lured investors from around the world with their lower capital costs. ', 'Yet not all are following this trend. The oil industry in Nigeria, Africas largest oil producer, champs at the bit for an investor-friendly overhaul, a part of which is named the Petroleum Industry Governance Bill, that has languished for years. But under the leadership of president Muhammadu Buhari  who has a penchant for state intervention  Nigeria may actually increase taxes on deepwater oil production, a move that the International Energy Agency warned in November could make investments far less attractive and threaten future development. ', 'Ironically, if Nigeria does push through the tax increase, it would be doing so largely because it badly needs to replenish revenues that have gone missing since a mid-2014 oil price crash. New taxes would surely generate short-term revenue. But if investor sentiment suffers, Nigeria may well decide in coming years that it simply cant hold out against the tyranny of low prices.  ', 'Stuck in the down position', 'Carole Nakhle, an energy economist, has a word for the ebb and flow of the fiscal conditions that oil-rich countries impose on oil companies: the pendulum effect. When oil prices rise, host countries ratchet up taxes and other terms to squeeze a larger share of profits out of companies. When prices fall back down, countries lower taxes back down again. They cant afford the risk of scaring away the companies, whose expertise is crucial in getting the black stuff out of the ground. ', 'Since a massive collapse of oil prices in 2014, the pendulum has been swinging down again. Except this time there may be no swinging back up. ', 'When Saudi Arabia turned on the taps in 2014, in a bid to drive American shale oil producers out of the market, prices collapsed by more than 50%. Oil companies slashed capital spending, investing $779 billion in 2014 but only $583 billion in 2015. Today, prices have recovered but remain well below a decade ago, and oil firms still probably cant recover costs at oil fields with breakeven prices below $60, according to Rystad Energy. So theyve mostly steered clear of any countries, like Angola or Algeria, that hadnt relaxed their fiscal terms. ', 'In worse news for oil producers, a consensus is forming that oil prices may never again reach the heights of 2013 and early 2014, at least not for any long period of time. Anytime oil prices again rise too high, the thinking goes, resilient US shale oil producers will come back online in droves, boosting global supplies and pulling prices back down again. Nor is it likely that oil demand will sustain a renewed rise in prices. Economists anticipate that the worlds demand for oil  currently running at some 100 million barrels per day  could peak sometime in the mid- to late-2020s and decline thereafter. As producers scramble to sell their oil reserves while there is still a market for them, prices could tumble further. ', 'It has taken some time, but the spate of oil-producing countries which have begun to lower the drawbridge to investors  including many in Africa, where capital is notoriously flighty  is a sign that reality has caught up with them, experts say. ', 'Lower oil prices drive political acceptance and support of investment, Nakhle wrote last year. In todays climate, pro-investment policy reforms are more evident as countries compete harder for global capital.  ', 'The era of lower-for-longer oil prices era has also handed leverage back to the majors. Giant companies like ExxonMobil, which makes a quarter of a trillion dollars annually and operates around the world, have little incentive to stick around in a given country if the government refuses to lower taxes on oil extraction; they can simply head elsewhere. In fact, whether a country has friendly investment terms or not is arguably the most important criterion for investors. The additional costs imposed by fiscal regimes are the largest single source of cost differences among oil-producing nations, according to data from Rystad Energy. In other words, for firms, the oil itself matters less than the terms attached to it. ', 'Companies may also be benefiting from a fundamental shift in the nature of energy markets. In her 2017 book Windfall, Harvards Meghan OSullivan argues that the US shale revolution, in addition to robbing market share from OPEC and its allies, has shifted the power balance away from producers back toward consumers and the companies that supply them. If oil is abundant and comes from a variety of sources, companies need not pay fealty to a given country or countries. In an apt illustration of the principle, OSullivan recalls how, in 2014, Russias state-owned Gazprom cut off gas supplies to Ukraine, which had no other ready source of gas. It was a blatant exercise of power, demonstrating the power that producers enjoyed over consumers. Since then, though, a profusion of US natural gas supplies has created new markets, including across the Atlantic. Russia would probably struggle to starve Ukraine of gas today, since Ukraine would able to access supplies from Europe. (It would still be painful.) ', 'Of course, unlike natural gas, oil has long been a global market, with tankers sailing around the world for decades. Nevertheless, with projections showing that the US is poised to join Saudi Arabia and Russia as top oil exporters and Brazil anticipating its own production growth spurt, the source of global flows of oil are steadily becoming more diverse. ', 'In the past, when oil production was more concentrated, [producers] could act more like a cartel and keep prices [e.g., taxes] high in the face of decreasing demand, said Ben Ho, a former lead energy economist at the White House Council for Economic Advisers. With more competition, oil producing countries have less market power and therefore respond more immediately to shifts in demand.  ', 'As oil prices drift lower, what of development? ', 'For now, oil prices have recovered. The price of a barrel of Brent crude touched $52 a year ago, but a recent trifecta of extended production cuts by OPEC and its allies, a tentative US-China trade deal, and unexpectedly strong global growth have pushed the price back up above $65 per barrel. ', 'Still, few doubt that in the long term prices will come down and stay down. In an email, Ho wrote: I think there is a general expectation that both in the near term (potential for global recession which always has a big demand effect) and the long term (as new oil technologies, not to mention climate change regulation and electric cars) will dramatically bend the trajectory of future oil demand and thus future oil prices. ', 'What does that mean for many developing nations, who have long depended on their ample oil reserves for economic growth? Some observers say the oil slump of 2014 jolted these countries out of their complacency. If access to plenty of oil is in fact a disease  in that it enables countries to forego difficult reforms, such as implementing taxes and rooting out corruption  then the hard reality of terminally declining oil revenue could be a welcome shove in the direction of needed reforms. ', 'Angola is a case study in the corrupting power of oil wealth and a sign of what could lie ahead. Between 2002, the year it staggered free of a 27-year-long civil war, and 2010, oil production soared from 300,000 barrels per day to a peak of 2 million. Angolas gross domestic product (GDP) hitched a ride, rising from $15 billion in 2002 to $146 billion in 2014. As recounted in A Magnificent and Beggar Land, a post-civil war history of the country, these were years of excess. Under longtime leader Jos Eduardo dos Santos, Angola built up its gleaming capital Luanda into the worlds most expensive city for foreigners  the facade of modernity, and to hell with the plumbing  but its industrial ventures often amounted to imitations of productive enterprise rather than the genuine article. Poverty remains widespread and corruption is among the worst in the world. Transparency International ranks Angola 165th most corrupt out of 180 nations. ', 'Yet today there are signs of change. President Joao Lourenco, who took office in late 2017, has so far taken all the right steps to begin to tackle corruption, experts say, and the country is working harder than ever to diversify its economic base away from oil. ', 'The party may be ending, but the work has begun.', 'nSource: Forbes']"

From negative borrowing costs to bitcoin, here are ten trends that have upended traditional economic and investment models in the past decade:', '1/FAANG-TASTIC FIVE', 'nIf they were a country, they would be the fifth largest in terms of economic output, outgunning Britain and snapping at Germanys heels. With a $3.9 trillion market value (versus around $100 billion in January 2010), tech giants Facebook, Amazon.com, Apple, Netflix and Google-owner Alphabet  collectively known as the FAANGs  are not only at the vanguard of historys longest share bullrun but have transformed how humans work, shop, consume news and relax.', 'FAANGs comprise 7% of the MSCI global equity index today, up from around 1.6% in early 2010. The savvy investor who sank $25,000 in Netflix in 2009 would now be sitting on $1 million.', 'And in the slip stream of the five pioneers, other tech titans are rising, from Chinas BAT grouping of Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent to sector disupters Uber, Airbnb and Deliveroo. For better or worse, the world  and markets  have changed for ever.', '2/PAYING TO BORROW', 'nA defining feature of the years following the 2008-2009 meltdown was the slide of interest rates and government borrowing costs below 0%, possibly for the first time in history. U.S. and German 10-year borrowing costs collapsed by 200 to 400 basis points this decade; the latter to as low as minus 0.7%. Roughly $12 trillion in debt carries negative yields, almost a quarter of all bonds outstanding.', 'The drivers  central banks asset buying, sub-zero interest rates, yield curve manipulation and the tech revolutions deflationary effects  were in themselves groundbreaking, at least in terms of scale. The Bank of Japan holds assets collectively worth more than Japans economy. The European Central Banks balance sheet is a quarter the euro zones annual output but double decade-ago levels.', '3/A CENTURY IN BONDS', 'nWith record-low rates and yield-starved investors, bonds with tenors longer than the average human lifespan have caught on.', 'A handful of 100-year bonds were around in 2010, but Mexicos $1 billion issue maturing 2110 started an issuance surge that saw U.S. and British universities, Ireland, Belgium and Austria, U.S. municipalities and corporations such as Coca Cola and Petrobras sell century bonds. Even junk-rated serial defaulter Argentina drew huge bids for its 2117-maturity bond.', 'Just over 1,400 century bonds, worth almost $170 billion are now outstanding, according to Refinitiv.', 'But  caveat emptor. Buyers of the Argentine century bond have watched it lose half its value. Austrias issue, also sold in 2017, is up more than 60%. ', '4/COINING IT', 'nIn 2010, Bitcoin was an idea causing ripples in niche online forums. Ten years later, cryptocurrencies are intertwined with finance, business and politics.', 'Crypto markets, non-existent in 2010, are now worth over $200 billion, having hit a $815 billion peak at the apex of the bitcoin bubble. Having changed hands for just 3 cents in its first public trade, bitcoin now trades over $7,500. Thats off its peak near $20,000, though  a reminder of its volatility. Usage has also spread. Coin Metrics estimates that from 130 active bitcoin addresses a decade back, there are now nearly 750,000.', 'Crypto took many guises through the 2010s, from rebel technology to a tool for criminals, speculative token to the great hope for frictionless payments. While it never really shook off doubts over security, virtual money and blockchain tech have evolved at a dizzying pace, typified recently by Facebooks push to launch its Libra token and steps by central banks to create their own digital currencies.', 'Interactive graphic here 5/PASSIVE AGGRESSIVE Sometimes its better to be passive. The punter who opted to ride the past decades equity boom via an exchange-traded fund (ETF) tracking the S&P500 would have earned 200% but at a fraction of the fee a mutual fund manager would have charged. Hence spectacular ETF growth  assets have swelled to almost $7 trillion, from below $2 trillion in 2010, consultancy ETFGI says. Low investment fees should help extend the boom: total ETF assets could hit $50 trillion in 2030, BofA predicts.', '6/INVESTMENT CLIMATE', 'nWith the hottest four years on record occurring in the past four years (according to the World Meteorological Organization), climate is shaping investor thinking in a way it did not a decade ago.', 'Crop failures, floods and wildfires can all inflict portfolio losses. More funds are reducing exposure to polluting industries, embracing renewables and water conservation technologies or investing in the likes of fake-meat firm Beyond Meat, whose 2019 IPO was greeted with rapture on Wall Street.', 'Over $30 trillion is held in sustainable or green investments, the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance estimates, more than doubling from 2011.', 'Green bonds debuted in 2007 to fund projects with environment benefits. This year, issuance totaled a record $200 billion-plus.', '7/SHALE OIL', 'nHaving learned to wring oil from shale with fracking, the United States has vaulted to the top of the oil producer rankings, with 12.5 million barrels per day of output, double 2010 levels. Shale oil production exceeds 9 million bpd, from below one million bpd in 2010, making the United States an oil exporter for the first time in 40 years.', 'The shale boom is partly why conversations around energy have switched from peak supply to peak demand. Surging output comes alongside environmental concerns, meaning an oil glut is likelier than shortages. Interactive chart here', '8/ELECTRIC DREAMS', 'nHaving relied for over a century on the internal combustion engine, the global auto industry is being upended by battery-powered cars. In 2010, electric car maker Tesla went public and its shares, launched at $17, now trade at $380.', 'Hundreds of billions of dollars have been pledged to develop a new generation of electric cars. Industries supplying car batteries are booming and demand for their main component, lithium, could triple by 2025.', 'EV sales so far have disappointed  two out of 100 cars sold today are electric. Petrol and diesel vehicles are cheaper and EV charging infrastructure is limited.', 'But growing alarm over climate change and government incentives to steer consumers away from petrol means the electric revolution looks unstoppable.', '9/FLASH BOYS, FLASH CRASHES', 'nTechs transformative power has not bypassed currency trading floors. Ten years ago, dealers did the buying and selling for banks and clients. Today, electronic trading comprises 90% of some products, doubling in this period. Another shift is towards algos  computer programmes that follow pre-set instructions, or algorithms, to trade, often at speeds impossible for humans.', 'From being largely nonexistent a decade ago, algo trading now comprises a fifth of FX spot volumes on Refinitiv FXall, a platform for the buyside. On another venue EBS, over 80% of the order book is algo-driven, the Bank for International Settlements estimates.', 'One side effect is that flash crashes  wild exchange rate swings  have become frequent, ostensibly due to algos that are programmed to turn off if markets become volatile.', 'The winners? Those who can afford the most sophisticated algos. Almost half of global currency trading is now with the top five banks, with smaller institutions  and of course, traders  having to exit. 10/GOING TO POT Marijuana took a trip this decade from street corners to stock markets. The first pure-play U.S. potstock  Tilray  debuted on NasDaq in 2018, leaping 36% on the first day. And 18 months since Canada legalised recreational cannabis, hundreds of potstocks are trading.', 'Pot also spawned one of the decades asset bubbles. Dubbed the green rush, shares in firms such as Aurora Cannabis and Canopy Growth rose several-fold before peaking in October 2018. At their high, the 10 biggest components of a potstock benchmark, the Alternative Harvest ETF, were worth $50 billion.', 'A year later, $30 billion had gone up in smoke. Blame regulation and overproduction hitting weed prices. A sign of a maturing industry? The highs may have evaporated, but potstocks arent going anywhere. Except perhaps London, which may host the next set of cannabis listings in 2020.', 'nSource: Reuters (Graphics by Ritvik Carvalho; reporting by Sujata Rao, Dhara Ranasinghe, Tommy Wilkes, Saikat Chatterjee, Elizabeth Howcroft, Tom Wilson, Julien Ponthus, Joice Alvarez and Thyagaraju Adinarayan)']"

Trade issues not only led to reduction in global final consumption but also caused investment growth to decelerate. On the positive side, global trade slowdown has likely bottomed out, and now the negative trend in industrial production seen in 2019 is expected to reverse in 2020. As a result, global economic growth is forecast at 3.0% for both 2019 and 2020.', 'Recent progress on various trade agreements such as the conclusion of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership of Asian-Pacific nations may provide the base to re-energize the momentum in global trade, although challenges remain, particularly regarding ongoing trade talks between the US and its trade partners, particularly China.', 'While global monetary policies continue to be accommodative, high debt levels in many major economies represent some risk.

Oil demand in the OECD is projected to grow by a marginal 0.02 mb/d in 2019, due to slowerthan-expected demand in the Americas and Asia Pacific. Weaker-than-expected diesel requirements in the US amid the slower pace in manufacturing and construction activity have limited demand growth in the current year. In Asia Pacific, significant petrochemical plant turnarounds reduced demand for petrochemical feedstock in 1H19. In non-OECD oil demand in 2019 is anticipated to rise by 0.96 mb/d, primarily as a result of slower-than-expected demand in India due to reduced industrial and transportation fuel requirements in 2Q19 and 3Q19. In 2020, global oil demand is expected to grow by 1.08 mb/d, with the OECD growing by 0.07 mb/d. OECD Americas is anticipated to be the only OECD region in positive demand growth territory next year, supported mainly by petrochemical capacity additions. In the non-OECD region, oil demand growth is projected to be around 1.01 mb/d, with growth projected to improve in Other Asia, Latin America and the Middle East. Indeed, the transportation and petrochemical sectors are expected to continue leading oil demand growth in 2020.', 'On the supply side, non-OPEC oil supply growth in 2019 has been lower than initial market expectations, now standing at 1.82 mb/d compared to the initial projection of 2.10 mb/d in July 2018.

As per BP, Chinese oil demand has been growing at an average annual rate of 5.5 per cent, whereas demand in India has been growing by some 5.1pc since 2008.', 'In sharp contrast, the US oil demand has only been climbing by 0.5pc per annum over the last decade and the consumption growth in OECD has in fact been contracting-albeit slowly-over the years.', 'With little energy resources of their own, both China and India are overwhelmingly reliant on imported oil, Kemp points out. While the Chinese crude consumption averaged 13.5m bpd in 2018, the percentage of imported oil in its total consumption is almost 70pc. While India is consuming 5.1m bpd of oil, 80pc of its requirements are met by imports.', 'However, despite the shale revolution and modest domestic demand growth, in absolute terms, the US remains the worlds largest oil consumer, guzzling around 20m bpd of crude.', 'Markets also keep a close watch on the US data, its crude consumption and imports, week by week. As per the latest EIA report, the US imported 6.9m bpd of oil in the first week of December. This is more than a quarter of the US domestic consumption and also more than Indias total consumption.', 'Any major movement in the US energy data hence continues to impact the markets significantly.', 'Kemp argues that the size of the US consumption, hence, makes the EIAs weekly petroleum status report popular among oil traders and others. Before taking a decision, they need to look at those figures closely. Only last week, after the EIA reported a smaller drawdown in the US inventory, crude markets pared some of its gains.', 'While some including the IEA still point to a coming glut, JP Morgan and few others have now interestingly begun looking the other way and raising their oil price forecasts for next year. As per JP Morgans projections, rather than oversupply, the oil market will be in a deficit next year, by 200,000 bpd.', 'This is in stark contrast to its estimates from September that assumed a 600,000 bpd oversupply situation for 2020. It expects a 1m bpd global demand growth-the same as its September forecast.', 'Goldman Sachs has also revised upward its oil price forecast for next year. It is now expecting Brent crude oil to average $63 next year, with WTI averaging $58.50 per barrel, according to its revisions made last week. Yet, others, including the International Energy Agency, are pointing to the coming glut.', 'The fact is we are living in a sellers market. Saudi Arabia is no more the swing producer of the world and the Opec is no more in the driving seat. It is the consumers who are literally in control of the crude markets.', 'nSource: Dawn']"

    "content": "['Depending on the person you talk to, the global LNG supply glut will either end or persist during the early part of next decade.', 'A recent outlook from S&P Global Platts Analytics projected that the surge in new global LNG supply will finally come to an end by the middle of 2020, with capacity growth next year expected to be the slowest in five years. New supplies coming mainly from the US will still test the markets ability to consume it, and sufficient demand growth will largely depend on lower prices.', 'As long as we can be competitive out of the US as it relates to our feedstock, I would be surprised to see a massive disruption in the US industry, said Omar Khayum, CEO of Annova LNG, an Exelon-backed export project being developed in Brownsville, Texas.', 'Platts Analytics expects that US LNG export volumes will rise from approximately 7.6 Bcf/d this month to 12.2 Bcf/d a year from now. That would be a build of 60%, versus the 65% increase over the last year. US export volume growth is expected to plunge to 10% in December 2021 compared with December 2020 and 5% in December 2022 compared with the previous December.', 'Pressuring traditional market fundamentals will be the likelihood that final investment decisions on additional global production capacity could increasingly move ahead without being connected to long-term contracts with end-users. The LNG market will need to respond more broadly by incentivizing additional investment in LNG use and gas demand, Platts Analytics said in the outlook.', 'In a recent report, Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. analysts described a spate of FIDs by deep-pocketed backers as a changing of the guard, reflecting the difficulty of securing long-term contracts, while indicating a growing spot market that further disincentivizes contracting. The energy investment bank expects contracts to become shorter and more flexible on volume, price and destination.', 'The size of the LNG spot market is growing, and the price of a spot LNG cargo is lowering, said Katie Bays, an energy analyst and co-founder of research and consulting firm Sandhill Strategy. Thats a typical example of an oversupply environment. And an oversupply environment is a tough environment for commercial commitments, which is what independent projects need.', 'There are rising expectations that the market will continue to transition toward supply-push dynamics instead of demand-pull, shifting risk from the buyer to the seller. Loose market conditions spurred speculation in 2019 about potential curtailments of US LNG production at existing facilities.', 'The market is going to be loose again, and there is no really good reason absent some kind of major policy intervention why 2020 will be a significantly different year than 2019, Bays said.', 'With existing long-term contracts with Asian buyers tied to legacy projects in more mature exporting countries around the world set to expire over the next few years, the supply picture could be impacted. In new deals, buyers are seeking shorter, more flexible terms, and some are even said to be seeking exit clauses in case the market changes dramatically during the contract term.', 'In existing 20-year contracts, it is not uncommon for there to be a so-called price reopener clause that would allow the parties to renegotiate the price every five years to get closer to the market rate at that time, if it is widely out of alignment, said Meg Gentle, CEO of Driftwood LNG developer Tellurian and a former marketing chief at Cheniere Energy.', 'That makes it more important for developers to be nimble and consider alternative business models in trying to balance supply and demand, Gentle said.', 'Well manage our marketing book tightly on a five-year forward-looking basis, Gentle said. So, theres no need for a walkaway clause. Whatever term you want, thats what well do.', 'nSource: ', 'nttttttttttntttttnttttttttt']"

Grades such as Russias ESPO have become more favored as a result, said four traders and refiners, while Australias Van Gogh and Pyrenees turned pricey due to demand for blending.', 'Murban for February traded at a discount of 15 cents against its official price on Thursday, dropping from a 25-cent premium just days before. The fall in prices also came as very-large crude carrier costs from Middle East to China rose to a two-month high. Russian ESPO prices, on the other hand, traded at a premium of $8 to $8.40 a barrel over its benchmark price, the highest in about two months as Chinese refined snapped up cargoes.', 'Distillates Disappoint', 'This month, the popularity of Murban crude also eroded as processing profits from gasoil were at an average of $15 a barrel so far in December, about 10% lower than the average for the second half of the year. While Murban at a discount isnt good news for term lifters, buying interest could reemerge should spot differentials fall further or official prices decline.', 'While marine gasoil was previously seen as the biggest beneficiary from the industrys scramble for IMO-compliant fuels, shippers have so far gravitated to VLSFO due to its high viscosity that aids engine performance. Vessels that ply long-haul routes  from Europe or America to Asia  are particularly in favor of this option, according to Abhishek Nambiar, an oil market analyst at FGE.', 'Low-sulfur diesel as shipping fuel is losing its status as an IMO golden child, wrote Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts in a Dec. 13 note.

Natural gas consumption reached a record high, rising by 10% from 2017. This increase in natural gas, along with relatively smaller increases in the consumption of petroleum fuels, renewable energy, and nuclear electric power, more than offset a 4% decline in coal consumption.', 'Petroleum consumption in the United States increased to 20.5 million barrels per day (b/d), or 37 quadrillion Btu in 2018, up nearly 500,000 b/d from 2017 and the highest level since 2007. Growth was driven primarily by increased use in the industrial sector, which grew by about 200,000 b/d in 2018. The transportation sector grew by about 140,000 b/d in 2018 as a result of increased demand for fuels such as petroleum diesel and jet fuel.', 'Natural gas consumption in the United States reached a record high 83.1 billion cubic feet/day (Bcf/d), the equivalent of 31 quadrillion Btu, in 2018. Natural gas use rose across all sectors in 2018, primarily driven by weather-related factors that increased demand for space heating during the winter and for air conditioning during the summer. As more natural gas-fired power plants came online and existing natural gas-fired power plants were used more often, natural gas consumption in the electric power sector increased 15% from 2017 levels to 29.1 Bcf/d. Natural gas consumption also grew in the residential, commercial, and industrial sectors in 2018, increasing 13%, 10%, and 4% compared with 2017 levels, respectively.', 'Coal consumption in the United States fell to 688 million short tons (13 quadrillion Btu) in 2018, the fifth consecutive year of decline.

Coal-fired power plants continued to be displaced by newer, more efficient natural gas and renewable power generation sources. In 2018, 12.9 gigawatts (GW) of coal-fired capacity were retired, while 14.6 GW of net natural gas-fired capacity were added.', 'Renewable energy consumption in the United States reached a record high 11.5 quadrillion Btu in 2018, rising 3% from 2017, largely driven by the addition of new wind and solar power plants. Wind electricity consumption increased by 8% while solar consumption rose 22%. Biomass consumption, primarily in the form of transportation fuels such as fuel ethanol and biodiesel, accounted for 45% of all renewable consumption in 2018, up 1% from 2017 levels.

At present, the upper limit on sulfur oxides is 3.5%.', 'Major oil companies and shipowners have spent billions of dollars preparing for the changes but energy analysts have expressed some concern that many in the oil and shipping industries still appear to be unprepared.', 'The market is in complete flux. Nobody seems to have the answers of how this will play out, Patrik Berglund, CEO of Xeneta, a Norwegian-based company that crowdsources freight data, told CNBC via telephone.', 'Berglund had previously described IMO 2020 as the opportunity of a lifetime for shipping liners to raise their prices, since the entire industry expected increased costs.', 'We would have expected to see these cost increases already (but) shipping liners are definitely not capitalizing on this opportunity. It is flabbergasting.', 'It is a complete mess and the customers are suffering with all of this uncertainty, he added.', 'Compliance concerns', 'nThe new regulations are the result of a recommendation that came from a subcommittee at the United Nations (UN) more than a decade ago and was adopted in 2016 by the UNs IMO, which sets rules for shipping safety, security and pollution.', 'The entire industry is under intense pressure to slash its sulfur emissions, given the pollutant is a component of acid rain, which harms vegetation and wildlife and is also blamed for some respiratory illnesses.', 'More than 170 countries, including the U.S., have signed on to the fuel change.', 'It means that ships found in violation of the new laws risk being impounded and ports in cooperating countries are expected to police visiting vessels.', 'Matthew Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData, told CNBC that he believed there was going to be very strong compliance with the new rules  at a rate of around 90%.', 'The reason for this is threefold: because the major shipping companies already have their ducks in a row, because major ports wont want the black eye of providing non-compliant fuel, and because shippers will lose their insurance, and hence, their livelihood if they use non-compliant fuel.', 'Xenetas Berglund agreed that shipping liners would most likely not want to be seen taking risks when it comes to non-compliance, especially with so much attention on the intensifying climate crisis.', 'I think it would be extremely harmful for anybody to try and push the boundaries on this, he added.', 'Record volumes of US crude seen heading to Europe', 'nMaritime transport is critical to the global economy, with more than 90% of the worlds trade carried by sea, according to the United Nations (UN).', 'It is also  by far  the most cost-effective way to move goods and raw materials.', 'Ahead of the implementation of IMO 2020, ClipperDatas Smith said it was clear that light sweet crude was very much in demand  pointing out that record volumes of U.S. crude had been seen heading into Europe in November.', 'At the same time, youre seeing Urals exports  which is a heavier sour crude  tanking due to lower demand, Smith said.', 'The worlds two largest container shipping lines, A.P.

    "content": "['The start of the new decade heralds some big changes for Middle East crude flows to Asia.', 'The region has long banked on its plentiful oil supply and a convenient geographical location, along with region-specific pricing and long term contracts to lock in revenues from its number one resource: crude oil.', 'But now, increasing competition from arbitraged barrels and changing appetite for crude feedstock in Asia may force this cluster of oil producing nations out of their conservative shell.', 'ASIAN BUYERS KEY TO PRODUCERS', 'nIn 2020, the Middle East will have to contend with two main competitive threats: the steady availability of foreign crude supply to Asian refiners and the International Maritime Organisations low sulfur mandate, which is setto kick in from January 2020.', 'The IMOs low sulfur fuel requirements combined with increasing availability of crude grades from around the world could provide Asian customers a pivot to reduce their heavy dependence on Middle East crude oil in favor of themost competitively priced barrel available on the global crude market.', 'For instance, Chinas dependence on Middle East crude has steadily fallen from 52% of its total crude imports in 2015 to around 44% in 2019, according to the countrys General Customs Administration data. Middle East crude imports to South Korea have also dropped from 86% of its total crude imports in 2016 to around 71% in 2019, Koreas Customs Service data showed.', 'Recently, countries as far away as Norway have made it to the top 10 list of crude suppliers to Chinas independent refineries for the very first time in November. Multiple China-based refiners purchased various grades from the North Sea producer, including its latest offer, Johan Sverdrup.', 'PRODUCERS WEIGH THEIR OPTIONS', 'nTo respond to this competitive threat, the Middle East producers have had to weigh the options available to them, and consider whether to protect revenue or defend their market share in Asia.', 'Post-IPO Saudi Arabia in 2020 may choose to sacrifice winning greater market share in Asia by way of higher oilproduction, and may instead focus on boosting global oil prices by keeping its oil production lower in 2020.', 'It has already committed to cut its crude output by an extra 400,000 b/d over January-March 2020 as part of an OPEC+ deal signed off in Vienna this month.', 'Current prices for Dubai and Oman crude oil  the benchmark references Saudi crude is priced on  show a strongly backwardated market structure since July 2017, partly due to the OPEC+ production cuts.', 'This backwardated structure is highly likely to continue in 2020, as evidenced by Platts Dubai forward curve. The spread was last assessed on December 20 at $7.16/b for January to December 2020. So far, the markets expectationthat the backwardated structure of the Middle East crude market will ease along with a slowdown in demand for high sulfur crudes, has not panned out.', 'OFFICIAL SELLING PRICES SET TO ALIGN', 'nAnother big step in 2020 will be updates to the pricing methodologies of some of the regions producers, which will align Middle Eastern crudes in a directly comparable manner. This will in turn bring greater transparency to andput more purchasing power in the hands of the Asian refiner.', 'Currently, with the exception of UAEs Abu Dhabi National Oil Company and Qatar Petroleum, all Middle East producers price their oil to Asian customers on a forward month pricing mechanism.', 'Both state-owned entities have announced concrete plans to do away with retrospective pricing formulas to forward pricing, a move widely expected by the industry to be implemented within the first quarter of 2020.', 'Additionally, ADNOC announced in November, plans for its flagship crude grade Murban, to be listed on the Intercontinental Exchange in a bid to create a new regional benchmark for light crude in the first half of the year on a new Abu Dhabi exchange in partnership with nine international energy companies. The move will add a new dimension to the dynamics of Middle East crude trading.', 'The attraction with Murban is that due to its liquidity and the nature of its pricing and trading cycle, forward trading is very possible and will come about naturally, the head of crude trading based in Singapore said.', 'And because of that, a forward derivative market for it could develop with ease. Another benefit is that it iscomparable to the other light benchmarks such as WTI and Brent.', 'But as of now, market participants are watching with controlled optimism.', 'While 2019 will be remembered in global crude oil markets as a year of unexpected and high risk events in the Middle East, the year ahead will cement a crucial transition for the worlds largest oil producing and exporting region: one where it plays a more proactive, dynamic and global role in shaping oil markets than ever before.', 'nSource: ', 'nttttttttttntttttnttttttttt']"

Flooding the market with oil and reducing prices is not beneficial to any member of the cartel.

Rystads analyst believe WTI prices would have to fall to an average of $45 a barrel to have a sustained impact on Americas prolific shale plays.

If U.S. shale continues to defy expectations and register production growth close to the forecasted 900,000 barrels a day  as EIA forecasts  the cohesion of the OPEC+ group will face continued challenges.

But we doubt that governments will take advantage of this to loosen the fiscal purse strings.', 'Brent crude futures settled at $66.14 a barrel, down 40, or 0.6 per cent, on Friday, but marked a weekly rise of around 1.4 per cent. US West Texas Intermediate crude futures settled at $60.44 a barrel, falling 40, or 1.21 per cent, while gaining about 0.6 per cent on the week.', 'Deficits in Bahrain and Oman remain in excess of 5 per cent of GDP which, combined with high debt-to-GDP ratios and low savings, means the focus will remain on fiscal consolidation.', 'Meanwhile, 2020 budgets released by Saudi Arabia and Qatar over the past couple of weeks suggest that policy will stay tight.', 'In the former, with growth in the non-oil sector strengthening the authorities have shifted their attention back to their target of a balanced budget by 2023. Strong balance sheets mean that Kuwait and the UAE have the most scope to loosen policy.', 'The UAE is the one country where authorities are likely to be more inclined to ramp up spending in order to support the economy ahead of the Expo 2020 Dubai. Indeed, the UAE is the only economy in the Gulf where we expect growth to be stronger next year than most currently anticipate, Swanston said.', 'Francisco Blanch, head of commodities and derivatives research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, projects an average Brent price of $60 a barrel in 2020.', 'We believe spot prices could rise to around $70 a barrel by mid-year. Diesel prices, further boosted by a big surge in marine gasoil demand on the back of IMO 2020 regulatory changes, could approach $100 per barrel in the first half of 2020, Blanch said.', 'Slava Kiryushin, Dubai-based global head of energy at DWF, sees oversupply in the oil market.', 'Many oil traders have predicted a bullish 2020 for the global oil industry, with some going as far as speculating the revival of a $100 per barrel, Kiryushin added.', 'However, recent market analysis demonstrates that this is unlikely to happen and the market will be in a position of oversupply. My view is that this will primarily be due to increased shale production and a slower than expected growth of the global economy.', 'No doubt that the growth of the oil supply is a sensitive topic for Opec+ members as 500,000 bpd were agreed to be cut from Opecs supply. Overall, the market is less optimistic over the revival of the oil price.', 'Garbis Iradian, chief economist for the Mena at the Institute of International Finance, expects Opecs crude production to average 30.1 mbd, at par with 2019.', 'The oil market continues to see robust crude oil production from the US, Canada, and Brazil, which could lead to a supply glut in 2020. At the same time, growth in oil demand is likely to remain subdued given the continued slowdown in the global economy, Iradian said.', 'He sees non-Opec supply  including the US  is likely to increase by 2 mbd in 2020 as compared to an increase of 1.9 mbd in 2019.', 'nSource: Khaleej Times']"

    "content": "['Global oil markets notched up a number of milestones this year that echoed the story of the past decade: the world has shifted from an era of supply tightness to plenty.', 'What distinguished the developments of 2019 was not just how big they were but often how little impact they had. From the worlds biggest-ever initial public offering to its worst-ever supply disruption, a barrage of sanctions on exporters to two OPEC interventions, never before had so many momentous events left investors so unmoved.', 'At the heart of that indifference was the force that has transformed world energy balances over the past 10 years: the American revolution in shale oil and gas, which is cushioning global markets against shocks that would once have sent prices rocketing. This too achieved a landmark in 2019, turning the U.S. into an net exporter of crude and refined oil.', 'And there was another turning point showing the years ahead may also be marked by supply abundance. For the first time, the worlds leading energy institution predicted that demand for oil  once expected to keep growing almost indefinitely  will stall at the turn of the next decade.', 'This year is probably the first in my recollection where oil prices so extremely decoupled from geopolitical risk, said Amy Myers Jaffe, senior energy and environment fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. It was also the year when analysts and car companies started to talk about the possibility of peak car and peak demand with increasing probability.', 'The biggest headlines of 2019 came out of the worlds largest oil exporter, Saudi Arabia. Riyadh finally floated part of state oil giant Saudi Aramco after a laborious three-year process, securing a valuation of $2 trillion that made it the worlds biggest company.', 'Yet the 1.5% stake sold was just a portion of the original plan, and mostly marketed to local buyers instead of the foreign investors once courted, as fund managers balked at the lofty asking price.', 'A far more traumatic ordeal rocked Saudi Arabia in September, when a swarm of missiles and armed drones blasted its Abqaiq processing facility and briefly disabled half the kingdoms output capacity. Yemens Houthi rebel group claimed responsibility, although the U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo blamed Iran directly.', 'The sudden loss of 5.7 million barrels a day was exactly the crisis the industry had feared for decades, and in previous years might have triggered a prolonged rally. Although prices initially rocketed 19% in an unprecedented surge, the gains dissipated in two weeks.', 'Riyadhs attempts to shore up oil prices also yielded lackluster results. The Saudis led the OPEC cartel and its partners in not one but two coordinated production cutbacks this year, an unusual level of activity for the organization, and reduced its own output far more than initially planned.', 'Their efforts were amplified by extreme levels of political involvement in the oil market, as U.S. sanctions squeezed exports from OPEC members Iran and Venezuela to the lowest in decades. Yet prices remain about 12% below this years high, trading near $66 a barrel in London.', 'The main source of the cartels struggle remained the U.S. shale-oil industry, which has turned the country into the worlds biggest oil producer, and propelled nationwide production to a new record of almost 13 million barrels a day this year.', 'Even as the shale boom shows some signs of slowing, production from offshore deposits once thought unviable in an era of low prices  such as Brazil and Norway  is springing to life.', 'Despite major geopolitical tensions around the world, oil markets have remained surprisingly calm, said Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency in Paris. This is mainly due to significant amounts of oil supply coming into the market from the U.S. as a result of the shale revolution, and from other non-OPEC producers.', 'The transformation though isnt confined to the supply side of the market.', 'The IEA, which for years projected that oil demand would increase for the foreseeable future, predicted last month that consumption will plateau at the turn of the next decade as efforts to avert catastrophic climate change spur the use of more efficient car engines and electric cars.', 'Growth in world oil demand will dwindle from about 1 million barrels a day, or 1%, currently to roughly 100,000 a day in the 2030s, the IEA said. Sales of passenger vehicles with internal combustion engines are probably already in decline, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.', 'The change is increasingly occupying financial investors, who are shifting their portfolios from fossil fuels to more sustainable energy sources. Reflecting that anxiety, the organizers of the Oil & Money conference, held annually in London for the past four decades, announced a re-branding that will remove both words from the title.', 'Perhaps the greatest symbol of changing attitudes has been the rise of 16-year-old Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg. The strike for climate she began at school last year became a global phenomenon, leading her to address the United Nations in New York and earn Time magazines Person of the Year award  a level of international popularity the organizers of the Aramco IPO can only dream of.', 'nSource: Bloomberg']"

Since mid-November 2018, when the recent US rig count peak totaled 1,237, industry has lost 30% or nearly 400 rigs.', 'Moreover, the industry is still in search for the bottom of the US land rig count, investment bank Evercore ISI said last week in its annual Global E&P Spending Outlook for 2020.', 'This weeks land rig count totaled 831, up by four but down from 1,144 this same week in 2018, Enverus data show.', 'Evercore is forecasting the US land rig count to fall 10% in 2020 year on year, which is greater than its US capex spending forecast decline of 7% for next year.', 'The rig count gains are likely traceable to year-end drilling here and there as needed, possibly fueled by higher oil prices that finally mounted the $60/b milestone not seen in months, observers said.', 'LAST-MINUTE PORTFOLIO CLEANUPS', 'Its a bit premature to talk of a sustained rebound yet, but there was a year-end increase in vertical oil drilling which suggests some private operators are doing some last-minute portfolio cleanups that theyve budgeted, Enverus drilling analyst Bob Williams said.', 'The heightened activity might even have been conditioned on higher oil prices this last week in 2020  the first time NYMEX crude was above $60/b since mid-July, Williams said.', 'I think were headed for a period of relative oil price stability while consolidation continues in the industry, he said. That doesnt mean the consolidation wont continue, just that the rig count may have bottomed out.', 'This weeks total rig count gains came from oil-directed rigs, which moved up 10 to 695. Conversely, natural gas-oriented rigs moved down six to 160. In addition, a one rig rise came from basins classified as neither oil nor gas.', 'As a result, drilling ticked up in two of the largest domestic oil basins  the Permian in West Texas/New Mexico, and Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas as each added several rigs.', 'The biggest boost came from the Eagle Ford, which rose by four rigs to 77 week on week while the Permian was up three to 404. But the Bakken Shale in North Dakota/Montana fell by three rigs, leaving 50, while the SCOOP-STACK plays of Oklahoma and the Denver-Julesburg Basin remained static week on week at 41 and 23, respectively.', 'In gas basins, the Haynesville Shale in East Texas/northwest Louisiana dropped four to 47 while Appalachia  the Marcellus Shale, mostly found in Pennsylvania and the Utica Shale mostly in Ohio  declined two rigs, leaving 49.', 'That basin comprises the Wet Marcellus which lost one rig for a total of 19; the Utica, which also fell by a rig, leaving 12; and the Dry Marcellus, which was unchanged week on week at 18.', 'nPERMITS UP DESPITE BIG SLIDES IN SOME BASINS', 'As rig counts rose this week, so did permits  to 673 approvals this week, up by 55 from the prior week, although permitting slipped in some big basins. The biggest change was in the DJ Basin, down 71 this week to four, while the Eagle Ford was down 28 permits to total 60 and the Haynesville was down 22 to 10.', 'But the Permian was up 25 permits to 208 and the Dry Marcellus was up 17 permits to 24. Other named basins were up or down by less than 10 permits.', 'The period from late November through year end typically sees activity slowdowns as holiday vacations and exhausted capital budgets translate to flattish rig counts. Experts dont predict a great surge of drilling in the New Year, as by all accounts US capex should be down anywhere from 7% to upward of 10%.', 'That largely stems not only from oil price volatility where WTI prices, now slightly over $61/b, had dipped to the low $50s/b in October. Uncertainty on that front, as well as pressure from investors has resulted in an unprecedented commitment to capital discipline in the last couple of years, even with slightly higher oil prices this month than a few months ago.', 'Both oil and gas prices were up this week. WTI averaged $60.27/b for the current week, up $1.34, while WTI Midland price averaged $61.33/b, up $1.26 and the Bakken Composite price was $54.56/b, up $1.23.', 'For gas, Henry Hub price averaged $2.28/MMBtu, up 5 cents, while the price at Dominion South was $1.92/MMBtu, up 13 cents.', 'From early indications, oil executives appear set to continue a general program austerity in 2020 that focuses more on returning cash to shareholders, increasing cash flows and paying down debt than pushing dollars toward more wells and growing production.', 'On Monday, the US Energy Information Administration, in its latest monthly report that tracks monthly shale growth, projected domestic shale oil to grow by 30,000 b/d in January 2020 over December 2019 to nearly 9.14 million, a new record.', 'That said, the spectacular year-on-year shale growth appears of recent years to have stalled. While production is still growing, the rate is about 40% below a year earlier, EIA said.', 'Moreover, the 9.14 million forecast for January 2020 is up about 1.02 million b/d from January 2019  well below increases seen over the past two years.', 'nSource: ', 'nttttttttttntttttnttttttttt']"

    "title": "7 Things To Expect From The Oil And Gas Industry In 2020",
    "content": "['In keeping with what has become an annual tradition, we took out our handy crystal ball  manufactured from petroleum-based materials, of course  for a look at expectations for the year to come in 2020. What the crystal ball revealed is a mix of projected outcomes, some of which were entirely predictable, others not so much.', 'Here we go:', ' The domestic rig count will be largely stable, at least through the first six months of the year. Indeed, we saw what had been a steady fall during the final six months of 2019 become arrested during the past few weeks as companies drove completion of their years drilling budgets and prepared the field to quickly execute on their budgets for the first half of the new year. The Enverus daily rig count actually added 33 newly-active rigs during the first two weeks of December, while the Baker Hughes weekly count also saw a slight rise. This trend will carry over into the new year, and we should see the situation remain relatively stable, at least until companies revise their budgets for the second half of next year.', 'n Bankruptcies involving small to mid-size producers will accelerate. As I wrote earlier this month, ongoing tight access to capital markets has created an upstream industry segment of haves and have-nots, with the smaller to mid-size producers mainly feeling the squeeze. This tightened access to capital will inevitably lead to more bankruptcy filings, and that in turn will inevitably lead to', 'n an increased level of mergers and acquisitions taking place during 2020. As with the rig count stabilizing, we have already seen this begin to take place during December, with several sizable transactions being announced, including WPX Energys announcement of its $2.5 billion purchase of Felix Energy, a large operator in the prolific Delaware Basin region of the Greater Permian Basin. The service sector of the oil and gas business has also seen a series of mergers and acquisitions in recent weeks. Expect this level of activity to carry over into the new year. The haves will continue to have more in 2020 as the have-nots slowly fade from view.', 'n Commodity prices will remain range-bound in 2020. Simply put, the globe is awash in both oil and natural gas, a situation that will no change in the coming year. The price for West Texas Intermediate has broken above the $60 per barrel ceiling it experienced throughout most of 2019, but that is likely to be a short-lived phenomenon as the realities of the ongoing market over-supply will eventually dampen the current bullish market sentiment. Even less reason exists to expect any sustained improvement in the long-depressed natural gas price, although a sustained cold winter in North America could, if it materializes, provide relief for a few weeks.', 'n Shale production will just keep rising, despite all the fright media coverage predicting doom and gloom. The mix of producers will continue to evolve, as under-capitalized, highly-leveraged producers are merged into or acquired by larger, more integrated companies. That will happen because that is what market forces are demanding, and there is currently no one in government at any level willing or able to intervene to disrupt the market dynamics. That could all change in 2021 should an interventionist like Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders manage to win the presidency, but for 2020, the markets will rule.', 'n U.S. exports of both oil and natural gas in the form of LNG will continue to escalate. The EIA estimated the U.S. became a next exporter of oil for the first time in 70 years in September of this year, and we can expect more of the same in 2020 as production and export capacity at various Gulf Coast port facilities continue to rise.', 'n Finally, and happiest of all, events in the Middle East, such as Septembers missile attacks by Iran on Saudi oil infrastructure, will continue to have little if any real impact on oil prices. This shift in U.S. strategic interests in that unstable part of the world is a true, tangible gift to U.S. national security delivered by the shale revolution.', 'When President Donald Trump recently announced that he will soon withdraw another 4,000 U.S. military personnel from the 18-year-long quagmire in Afghanistan, Defense Secretary Mark Esper said the withdrawal can and will take place with or without a peace agreement in place with the Taliban. I would like to go to a lower number because I want to either bring those troops home to retrain for new missions or to be redeployed to the Indo-Pacific to face off our greatest challenge in terms of the great power competition  thats vis-a-vis China, he said.', 'This shift in Americas compelling national interest in remaining involved in various intractable conflicts in the Middle East region is the direct result of the countrys enhanced energy security brought about by the industrys ability to extract massive volumes of oil and natural gas from shale. That ability was made possible by the use of hydraulic fracturing, or Fracking.', 'Fracking says, youre welcome, America!', 'nSource: Forbes']"
